I have always experienced plumbing issues in our guest bathroom, had numerous plumbers come + snake the toilet, ton of draino, you name it. After numerous toilet overflows and having a non-functional bathroom.. I decided to call my homeowners to help me out. Thankfully they did.\\n\\nI decided to go through a company that lines the pipes instead of replacing them. Well, they came across a backed up line, that's been deleted from the home. The waste water goes nowhere but to the ground. I am furious! The seller who flipped the home decided to make it nice from the outside but ignored one of the most important foundations of a home. I called the city and there are absolutely no permits for what he did.\\n\\nWhat can I do to get this guy to get consequences for what he did? I have his information in my escrow papers.. called the city, he could get jail time. I don't want to ruin someones life but dang, he sure isn't mine that easy right now.\"},\n",

I had recently changed to Acceptance insurance, received a bill and promptly paid it.  When my insurance gets pulled after the accident, it comes to light that I don\\'t actually have insurance.  \\n\\nI check with Acceptance and they said there was an additional $200 dollars I owed.  That amount wasn\\'t what we agreed to and it wasn\\'t reflected on the bill I received.  Also, I paid on the website, where there was no option to pay anything less than full.  They eventually send me the bill that required I pay $200 more and in bold states insurance must be paid in full to ensure coverage.  \\n\\nI never received any notification before the accident requiring I make any additional payments. I try to make this case with Acceptance, but they just refer to the second bill.  \\n\\nMy case then goes to court, and the other driver doesn\\'t show.  The judge throws the case out, and I think its done.\\n\\nAfter this I get a letter from the dmv, stating I need to get an sr22 because of my \"uninsured\" status.  This is all new to me, I have no idea what it is.  I try to get across that I paid my insurance, and I shouldn\\'t have to do this, but it\\'s the dmv and there is no one there to help.  \\n\\nI\\'m getting pretty burned out and defeated after fighting with the insurance company and the dmv.  All the while my insurance rates have gone insanely high because of the sr22.  For minimum coverage insurance I\\'m now paying roughly between $3400-$3700 annual.  I\\'m young, in school and working full time trying to get by.  I\\'ve finally thought about dealing with this situation again.\\n\\nMy thinking is: Even if I can get a record from Acceptance stating that I paid this bill, would it even matter at this point?

We reported the income as miscellaneous income and did not file schedule C (the woman asked if we filed schedule C and I declined to provide her information unless she explained why she needed it, which she did not).\\n\\nNow comes COVID-19. My wife is no longer able to work since the woman no longer needs child care, and my wife is immune compromised increasing her risk from the virus. Initially we had not planned to file unemployment since my wife was not eligible to our understanding, but then came the CARES act and we jumped on it. We filed her application and it was approved. This is the point where the woman is dragged into this because we listed her as an employer up tot he date of unemployment.\\n\\nThe state appears to have sent her some communication. She texted my wife saying she needed to talk, so we jumped on the phone with her with me there. She comes out of the gate hot, furious about potential penalties, interest, back taxes. Talking about how there’s no paper trail (there is... the checks). She says to my wife “how are we going to deal with this?” And starts rattling off very specific questions about our filings. After a couple questions I took over the call because she was being aggressive and I politely ended the call after telling her she could email me the questions she had and I would research and respond. She declined that approach.\\n\\nCurrently she is communicating by text and we provided her the amount of income we reported from her (the sum of the checks) and advised her that we paid self-employment tax on the income. We also told her the dates we listed as my wife being employed for her on the unemployment application. We provided this in good faith because we’re not interested in her being harmed in this situation. However she continued to ask for more specific details about our filings and I put a halt on it by telling her I’m happy to help but I would need to know why she needed any more private information before I would provide it. She proceeded to deflect and became aggressive again.\\n\\nFor some background on me I have both legal and accounting backgrounds so I have a reasonable base of understanding in those areas but not specific to this situation.\\n\\nThose are the basic details and I will be happy to add more detail as requested. Questions are as follows:\\n\\n1) what is her (the woman) potential exposure here?\\n\\n2) do we have any potential exposure?\\n\\n3) is my approach to her requests for information correct?\\n\\n4) are there any specific steps we should take as this situation unfolds?\\n\\n5) should we cease communication with her?\\n\\nThanks for your help in advance. I made a good faith attempt to ensure this post follows legal advice rules and if I broke any rules please let me know and I will revise my post accordingly.'},\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Hello everyone,\\n\\nMy question is regarding **UK university** assessments and tuition fees for this semester due to the impact of the current situation\\n\\nGenerally, the university calculates the final degree classification using **second** and **third** year results with a weighting of 1/3 and 2/3 respectively for each year\\n\\nThird year consisted of the following:\\n\\n* Project         -  40 credits\\n* Semester 1 -  40 credits\\n* Semester 2 -  40 credits  \\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_  \\nTotal          =  120 credits\\n\\nI\\'m in my third year and due to the current situation, my university has decided to **cancel** exams for the second semester and instead use marks from previous assessments and exams to calculate a grade for this semester.\\n\\nAnd so as a result about 25 credits from semester 2 are not going to be counted which is about **%13.8** of the degree and could have potentially resulted in a higher final degree classification\\n\\nThe university has also charged full fees for the whole year regardless of the current situation and not counting a significant portion of the degree which is very unfair given that we were charged for it and that it could have improved final grade classification.\\n\\nWhen I outlined the aforementioned points to a representative from my university, they replied with the following:\\n\\n&gt;*The decision around the method being used to calculate final year grades has been finalised ... With respect to the question of fairness, analysis of student performance in previous years suggests that the approach being taken does not have significant impact on final results or degree classifications: the overall effect on the cohort is in fact a very small \\\\*improvement\\\\* in grade averages.*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*With respect to the question of tuition fees and the whole year, we should separate the questions of learning from assessment.*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*There was disruption to the final weeks of the semester. The University took significant efforts to ensure that, through online and alternative methods, teaching was delivered enabling students to learn the materials associated with course units. Tuition fees are primarily about supporting learning, rather than assessment.*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*A final exam is used to determine whether a student has achieved that ILO\\\\[i*ntended learning outcomes\\\\] *and is able to perform the task. The exam does not directly contribute to a student acquiring the ability to describe communication mechanisms, but provides a measure of the ability.*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*I hope this addresses your concerns. As is always the case, if you are ultimately unhappy with results, you will have a right to appeal.*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Side notes:**\\n\\n* The university is a top russell group university in England\\n* I\\'m classed as an international student and therefore charged £20,000 of tuition fees per academic year\\n* The university has also mentioned the following in one of it\\'s earlier updates(around march) but they haven\\'t released any new details regarding \"viva interviews\" yet and so it seems very unlikely\\n\\n&gt;*If you think you could have achieved a higher degree classification had the exams gone ahead, and your* performance\\xa0*profile during your studies supports this, then we’ll give you the opportunity to prove it by a remote viva interview (more details will be provided at a later time).*\\n\\n* The university has not calculated the results for this semester yet\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Questions**:\\n\\n1. I haven\\'t replied yet, what should I say in reply?\\n2. Can this be pursed legally(or within the university) so that they either\\n   1. refund me 25 credits worth of fees for this academic year (**preferred**)  or,\\n   2. consider examining me for the cancelled exams\\n3. is there anything else I can do?'},\n",

       "   'selftext': \"In 2017, I had a small business selling these chargers on eBay. I wasn't making too much money, but at the best I was making like $40 in profit per day, which is great in 7th grade. I decided to incorporate an LLC in Delaware (mainly because I was a 7th grader and I thought it would be so cool to say I'm a CEO of a company). Long story short, I paid and it was legally incorporated under my name. My parents were aware, but they didn't sign any documents or really allow it. What ended up happening is somehow the company I incorporated with told me that I had to pay a $300 annual tax, called the franchise tax. When I incorporated, I though that only franchises like 7/11 or McDonalds would have to pay it, so I thought it didn't apply to me.  However, my parents had to bail me out and they paid the $300, plus the over due fee, $200, and the payment rejection fee $50, and lastly, the $200 cancelation fee. In total it was $750. I ended up paying them back, but I recently found out that minors cannot legally sign contracts by themselves, meaning I should have never legally been allowed to incorporate my LLC, since my parents never signed anything. I was the only one signing and paying. **Would it be possible for me to get my money back since minors cannot legally sign contract by themselves?** I know that $750 isn't much compared to what other people had to go through, but I'm going to be a junior in high school and I am trying to save up for a car, and this would really help.\\n\\nThank you guys in advanced for your help.\\n\\ntl;dr: I incorporated a LLC in Delaware and I got charged with a lot of fees, but because I'm a minor, I shouldn't have been allowed to pay the fees, because I legally cannot sign contracts.\"},\n",

We don’t rely on her income and she only works when it’s convenient for her. During the 2019 year she worked several months for a woman taking care of her daughter. The job was inconsistent and the woman had multiple people she would bring in to work and watch her daughter depending on availability. My wife was paid by personal check every week that she worked.\\n\\nWe reported my wife’s income from the woman (a bit south of 3k) on our 1040 on Schedule SE and paid self-employment tax accordingly. We reported her income as self-employed due to the nature of the employment - my wife largely controlled the schedule and other factors. We reported the income as miscellaneous income and did not file schedule C (the woman asked if we filed schedule C and I declined to provide her information unless she explained why she needed it, which she did not).\\n\\nNow comes COVID-19. My wife is no longer able to work since the woman no longer needs child care, and my wife is immune compromised increasing her risk from the virus. Initially we had not planned to file unemployment since my wife was not eligible to our understanding, but then came the CARES act and we jumped on it. We filed her application and it was approved. This is the point where the woman is dragged into this because we listed her as an employer up tot he date of unemployment.\\n\\nThe state appears to have sent her some communication. She texted my wife saying she needed to talk, so we jumped on the phone with her with me there. She comes out of the gate hot, furious about potential penalties, interest, back taxes. Talking about how there’s no paper trail (there is... the checks). She says to my wife “how are we going to deal with this?” And starts rattling off very specific questions about our filings. After a couple questions I took over the call because she was being aggressive and I politely ended the call after telling her she could email me the questions she had and I would research and respond. She declined that approach.\\n\\nCurrently she is communicating by text and we provided her the amount of income we reported from her (the sum of the checks) and advised her that we paid self-employment tax on the income. We also told her the dates we listed as my wife being employed for her on the unemployment application. We provided this in good faith because we’re not interested in her being harmed in this situation. However she continued to ask for more specific details about our filings and I put a halt on it by telling her I’m happy to help but I would need to know why she needed any more private information before I would provide it. She proceeded to deflect and became aggressive again.\\n\\nFor some background on me I have both legal and accounting backgrounds so I have a reasonable base of understanding in those areas but not specific to this situation.\\n\\nThose are the basic details and I will be happy to add more detail as requested. Questions are as follows:\\n\\n1) what is her (the woman) potential exposure here?\\n\\n2) do we have any potential exposure?\\n\\n3) is my approach to her requests for information correct?\\n\\n4) are there any specific steps we should take as this situation unfolds?\\n\\n5) should we cease communication with her?\\n\\nThanks for your help in advance.

With respect to the question of fairness, analysis of student performance in previous years suggests that the approach being taken does not have significant impact on final results or degree classifications: the overall effect on the cohort is in fact a very small \\\\*improvement\\\\* in grade averages.*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*With respect to the question of tuition fees and the whole year, we should separate the questions of learning from assessment.*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*There was disruption to the final weeks of the semester. The University took significant efforts to ensure that, through online and alternative methods, teaching was delivered enabling students to learn the materials associated with course units. Tuition fees are primarily about supporting learning, rather than assessment.*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*A final exam is used to determine whether a student has achieved that ILO\\\\[i*ntended learning outcomes\\\\] *and is able to perform the task. The exam does not directly contribute to a student acquiring the ability to describe communication mechanisms, but provides a measure of the ability.*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*I hope this addresses your concerns. As is always the case, if you are ultimately unhappy with results, you will have a right to appeal.*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Side notes:**\\n\\n* The university is a top russell group university in England\\n* I\\'m classed as an international student and therefore charged £20,000 of tuition fees per academic year\\n* The university has also mentioned the following in one of it\\'s earlier updates(around march) but they haven\\'t released any new details regarding \"viva interviews\" yet and so it seems very unlikely\\n\\n&gt;*If you think you could have achieved a higher degree classification had the exams gone ahead, and your* performance\\xa0*profile during your studies supports this, then we’ll give you the opportunity to prove it by a remote viva interview (more details will be provided at a later time).*\\n\\n* The university has not calculated the results for this semester yet\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Questions**:\\n\\n1.

Back in April, when it was uncertain whether I'd be able to get any job and when (not to mention if school would reopen), I contacted my landlord inquiring about early lease termination.

He responded asking for proof of job loss.\\n\\nHad I been told this would be required, I would have acted differently, but I was not made aware through our phone conversation or in writing that this is required. I'm a student and was applying for summer jobs/internships around the time shit hit the fan and furloughs, shut downs, and lay offs came rolling through. I don't have a job I lost, but I missed a few months of income I had planned on having and there is only uncertainty now about getting a new job during this time.\\n\\nIf I had to take this to court, would the original email from him stating there's no termination fee and listing no other requirements count in my favor? \\n\\ntl;dr: Landlord stated in writing there was no fee for early termination due to covid, is now backtracking and requiring things that were not discussed.\"},\n",

Each member has their own car (go carbon footprint \\U0001f973), and as such, theres only room for 4 in the driveway. Back when I was home, I would get stickers on my car all the time for parking on the street overnight, as its against the neighborhood parking code, but nothing would ever happen. As far as the code goes, parking cannot be done on the street or grass, and driveways cannot be extended. The solution is to park in the “community lot” located in the center of the neighborhood, however, due to the virus, this lot is closed. So, upon leaving my car on the side of the road in front of my abode, I woke in the morning to find it towed, and had to pay a hefty bill for a college student. I’d like to talk with a representative of the master’s association in the neighborhood about a reimbursement, but I’d be greatly appreciative if anybody had any knowledge of what I could come in with as far as legality of them having my car towed, or if this is in any way feasible at all.\\nThanks!'},\n",

First is that we have a main line blockage making the house basically not usable as we can't run any water for more than a minute or two without the shower flooding. We got a home warranty but they denied the claim to fix it because we don't have a ground level clean out for the main sewer line. Also, the AC is having issues as well because the flippers decided to convert the garage into more livable space and add more ducting without adding another return. They also put a 5 ton (new!) HVAC unit on the roof but the only return in the house is too small for it (I had an AC guy come out yesterday to look at it). This causes awful airflow through the house and only about half the house cools properly. The other side (where they added the new ducting) gets hardly any airflow. This makes it to where the AC will run pretty much all day and never cool the house under 84 during the day (even though the unit is blowing cold air). This overworking causes the AC unit to freeze over occasionally. The AC guy quoted my $4k to fix the ducting (not including drywall repair) and I have no idea how much this main line blockage is going to cost as it could possibly be a broken pipe. We had a home inspection done during the home buying process and neither of these issues were found. I reached out to my realtor and she recommended contacting a real estate attorney. How could this help (I assume we try to get money from the seller)? And would the costs of getting an attorney cost more than to just fix the issues?\",\n",

He/ deputies kept trying to invalidate me, made it seem like i was making it up, etc. A chief deputy even asked me how did I feel about the police killings of black people (I’m black, the son is white btw.. not that it should matter) I told him that had nothing to do with what I was reporting. They chuckled?? They then asked if I had been drinking and I said just a little bit, not much. They said that since I’m 20 it’s illegal for me to drink and kind of threatened to suspend my license or a fine me. They ended up letting me go after letting me write a “statement”. I called to follow up this week and I haven’t gotten any calls back or spoken to ANYONE there. Can someone please tell me what I can do to help my case? I feel like I should let it go but I don’t want him to get away with what he did. It wasn’t right. I try to defend myself and I’m treated like a criminal ?? It’s so messed up. I am in the United States.',\n",

       " ['Background: For the past 20+ years my mom has lived with her boyfriend and also worked as his employee. The have a home/office. My grandmother also lives there and is paying rent to be in the extra room where my mom can take care of her. He is the owner of the business and recently accepted the bailout/loan/government money for his business. My understanding is that by accepting that money there is a condition to not fire/layoff anyone. Recently he had an episode, the result of which was firing all of his staff including my mom. My mom is attempting to collect unemployment but has no proof that she is unemployed now as he is refusing to provide documentation. Initially he was seeking to \"cut a deal\" with her where he pays her off the books in cash and does not charge her rent to stay there in exchange for her not filing. I believe he has defaulted on the terms on the government money and is trying to avoid having to give it back. Recently he has been saying that he will give her the paperwork to file but he still needs her to do her job as she runs an area of the company he is unequipped to do himself. As they have been in a relationship for 20+ years, he has always been successful in convincing my mom whats best for him is also good for her. My mom does not know her rights in the situation and has so far denied advice to seek legal help as she is afraid of the cost. I believe she is also afraid that by involving a legal entity could cause him to erupt. He is known to have a temper. I am trying to convince my mom to not pursue an \"off the record\" solution as I believe she has the legal high ground here and might lose it if she puts herself in a legally questionable situation. Any advice would be appreciated.',\n",

Tell her to file with what information she has, and expect to be contacted by the state unemployment office for more information. If he refuses to provide paperwork to them, he's just setting himself up for more problems. Her UI might be delayed, but she should be able to work around his shenanigans.\"],\n",
       " ['So my Dad and I had a falling out and he refuses to return my motorcycle or encloses trailer. It\\'s irreparable and I prefer it this way. I was storing my race motorcycle and trailer there and wasn\\'t in a hurry to collect it because I don\\'t have the space to store it. But I recently found out that he\\'s been using my trailer without consent or notice. I did have it locked up so he must have cut the lock and chain. The ownerships for both are on my name but address is where it is stored. I\\'m currently changing the ownerships to reflect my home address and am in possession of them. 1) Is there a way I can put a \"stop use\" on the trailer so he can be pulled over if he\\'s stopped with it? 2) I plan to call my local police department to help facilitate me collecting both motorcycle and trailer. Is there anything I need to specifically ask for? 3) There is also a slight possibility that he has moved the motorcycle and trailer to his farm property or cottage. What should I do if I show up and these aren\\'t there anymore? 4) He also has my racing equipment and items that I have receipts for. But some things I don\\'t (ie: spare set of rims and motorcycle parts and gear). Will I be able to collect these too or will I be limited to what I have proof of ownership of. My brother has also recently been hired as police constable as well. He says he doesn\\'t want to be involved but I\\'m pretty sure he\\'s been present when they make their cottage trips using my trailer. My Dad is very aggressive and I don\\'t want to knock on the door and THEN call. I\\'ve asked for these things many times and he\\'s refuses to deliver them and threatened to charge me with trespassing if I walk into the premises.'],\n",
       " [\"My girlfriend recently got into her first car accident while at work, but it was with her boss' car. The accident requires roughly $3500 in repairs to the other car involved but my gf boss doesn't have the right insurance and so they won't pay for anything. My girlfriend has insurance but they won't cover it because it is only for her own car obviously. So the $3500 is supposed to come out of someone's pocket which doesn't make sense to me to begin with. Her boss wants my girlfriend to pay for it and even fired her within the same week. She used some business terms to make it sound like it was a business decision but it was definitely because of the accident, it just wasn't the same after it occurred according to my gf. Is there any advice I can get to help her out? I don't think she should be paying out of pocket for the whole $3500 like her boss wants because if she had the right insurance, it would've been covered, that's on her in my eyes. Edit: I forgot to add I live in Iowa, in the United States.\",\n",

       " [\"I apologize for having such a specific question, but for over 8 months since being stationed in Japan I have walked past an abandoned sports car thats just sitting in a parking stucture on base. There is a thick layer of dust on it and it sucks to see because it's a dream car of mine. I have talked to many others who say they have tried to contact the previous owner with no success and who claim weird ways to take ownership of it but have yet to do it. Unfortunately from the limited information I've been able to get for Japanese abandoned car/property law and abandoned car laws for military installations it doesn't look too promising, which is quite a shame being what kind of car it is. Is there anything that can be done? Or am I forced to see a classic Japanese car rot?\"],\n",
       " [\"I work remotely (in Oregon) for a company that is headquartered in NJ. Most full-time employees receive 2 to 3 weeks' vacation per year. According to our company handbook, time that is not used in one year may be carried over to the first quarter of the following year -- if not used by that point, it is lost. You can also elect to be paid for unused vacation time. As part of the Covid crisis, my employer recently sent an email saying that all caryover vacation and cash payouts have been cancelled. Is there any kind of workplace law that covers this? Vacation is notoriously hard to schedule -- we are chronically understaffed and work in a client-focused industry where we often have to cancel or reschedule vacation time at the last minute to accommodate some client demand. I always end up with carry-over vacation because it's so hard to use before the end of the year, and I'm concerned that I'm going to end up losing a lot of PTO.\",\n",
