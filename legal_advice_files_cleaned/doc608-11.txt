hello all over the past few weeks i have started to receive texts from numbers i dont know claiming to be a person i chatted with on tinder or some other similar site. i am happily married for the last 7 years and have never had a tinder account or chatted with anyone of the opposite gender online. #x200b; my concern is that i got one of these fake texts with a semi explicit photo attached and i dont think the person that is in the photo is aware its being distributed. #x200b; not sure how where if i can report this. you could try a reverse image search to see if you can locate them. chances are it an instamodel that has her images stolen tons of times. on the other hand it likely that these are shotgunned scam attempts and the photo is just pulled from a google search. reverse image search it if you want to try and confirm that particular theory. suggest you simply ignore block.
