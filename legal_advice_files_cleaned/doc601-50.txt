this is in california. earlier in the fall moved into an apartment with two old high school friends. was working and paying a portion of the rent but never signed onto the lease. beginning of october they are placed into rehab for xanax addiction by their parents. per request of the parents i negotiated a new portion of rent to pay the parents who are signed onto the lease. by the time november comes i pay my rent to stay in the apartment for the month. i still did not sign any agreements so all payments were under the table. first week of november a large fire i am in ca destroys the homes of the parents completely. they now want to take over the apartment and want me to move out asap. even though i payed my portion of the rent to stay for november they have continually told me to get out and that they would involve the police. now that december has come i am in the process of moving out but the fire has displaced so many families that housing is scarce. i know i am technically not supposed to be in the house but i have nowhere to go. i am going to be out of the apartment by the end of the week and hopefully staying on a friends couch. however i am worried as the lease holders are becoming more and more hostile. i understand their situation but i am also in predicament as well. they want to make me look like i’m screwing them over and i’m concerned they might take legal action. can anyone recommend any tips i’m new to this and i’m not exactly sure what to do. i would describe your situation as a month to month subtenant of the lease holders. afforded all the protections of a month to month tenant the people on the lease are your landlords.
