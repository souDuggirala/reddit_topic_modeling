 do my best to keep this short my now ex fiance accepted a job in new mexico. he did not have a laptop so i offered to let him borrow my spare until he got a few paychecks and could buy his own. the plan was i would join him in a few weeks time but the relationship ended and now he is refusing to to return my laptop to me. i work from home and it was my spare back up laptop. it nothing fancy but something i paid for myself and need around in case of a problem with my usual laptop. i even offered to give him the money to ship it back to me. his response is i could fly out there and pick it up myself. is there anything i can do from a legal perspective to get my property back i know if the police or anyone would care that much over a \~$500 laptop. but it is mine it has work related programs info on it and i would like it back. thank you for your reply. i will take a look at those options. you can: 1. take him to small claims to recover the value of your laptop. 2. spend thousands of dollars to obtain a court order for the police to seize the laptop if it contains something valuable. you cannot: 1. report him for theft.
