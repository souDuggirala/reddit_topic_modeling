two years ago i financed a car with my now ex boyfriend. both him and i were listed on the car loan and the title. the problem begins when we break up and i move back home to new hampshire while he stays in florida. we both agree that i would take the car since he work or have a license. i moved home august of 2017. my florida plates were set to expire in april 2018 so i went to the dmv to get it squared away only for them to tell me that i register it if he was not there with me. this started months of stress trying to figure out how to remove him from the title. long story short i was able to refinance into a loan just in my name. i’m in the middle of that process now my question is how do i remove his name from the title my old car company santander said they are mailing me the title. my new car company dcu said to take the title to the dmv and have them list them as the new leinholder however how does that remove his name is there something else i have to fill out calling the dmv and county clerk has been no help. will i need to file for a new title i just have no idea how this process works and it been a huge source of stress for me because my car has been unregistered since april and i’m racking up tickets. thank you to any advice you may have. that makes all the difference. with that you may be able to file for the title without him. our title says “thathighwhitekid or ex bf ” not “thathighwhitekid and ex bf ” does that make a difference i’m reading that since it is written this way i can file for a new title without his signature. he is very unwilling to help with any of this and i have no way to get in contact with him since he is still in florida and has me blocked on everything. you need to get him to sign his name off of the title. that the only way to remove him. currently both still viewed as owners of the vehicle.
