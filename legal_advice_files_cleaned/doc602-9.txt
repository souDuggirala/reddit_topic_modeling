so i’m sure there is always a plentiful amount of people making these posts but figured ask to be a bit more specific for my situation. i dated a girl for 5 months and ended it because she was cheating on me. today she posted on her twitter a video of me and my dog laying in bed and said this is u senorcappuccino and he neglects his dog. he only pretends he likes her for the instagram. fuck this piece of shit. this is cause for concern because i will soon be entering the application pool to become a police officer and a background investigator is surely going to find this and think about it. i feel like if i get her to take it down then be an issue for my future. i did reach out to her to ask to take it down but kept it professional in case i was able to do something about it. i said “you should probably just move on with your life and be mature. i figure be nice and just ask you once respectfully to delete your tweet.” exactly word for word like that. any guidance is definitely appreciated thanks!
