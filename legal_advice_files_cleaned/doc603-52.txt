i travelled with my son to london a couple months ago from oslo for a weekend. our return flight from london was delayed by hours and minutes. it was supposed to land back in oslo by . leaving us hour and minutes to still make the last train from the airport to where we live on the west side of oslo i hold a monthly train pass and my son would travel for free on weekends . we obviously missed this by quite some margin. and taxis being obscenely expensive that they are here ended up costing me for a minute drive. their rules are that if a flight is delayed for avoidable reasons by more than hours you have a right to a claim. the reason the flight was delayed was because by the time the flight had touched down at gatwick the crew on board had already exceeded their max working hours for the day they had been working over hours . it took norwegian over hours to arrange for a new crew to arrive at the airport. infuriatingly they claim that this was an unavoidable circumstance which have been avoided even if all reasonable measure had been taken. here is their reply: quote thank you for contacting us with your claim. we regret the time it taken to respond to you and we thank you for your patience. unfortunately norwegian flight lgw osl . . was delayed by hours and minutes. this disruption was caused by extraordinary circumstances which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken. ______________________________ flight disruption information norwegian flight: lgw osl . . disruption type: delayed delay time: hours and minutes reason for disruption: this delay was caused by air traffic control restrictions causing subsequent crew rest. ______________________________ unfortunately unable to cover the expenses claimed as not liable for such costs. for information regarding the legal basis for the reimbursement of financial losses in the event of a flight disruption please see below . we apologise for the inconvenience caused on this occasion and hope to have the opportunity to welcome you on board a norwegian flight when you next choose to travel. unquote this is frankly ridiculous. it is absolutely foreseeable and avoidable had they had their systems in order. the flight took over hours to arrive from oslo to gatwick. it was clear the moment the plane departed that this crew would not be able to work further that night. they had full hours to arrange a new crew. yet it somehow slipped through and they try to claim it was an unforeseeable circumstance which is impossible for me to accept. i am sure they just bank on people not escalating these matters further as not being worth their time and effort. but frankly i'm willing to spend money on this issue just out of principal. what can i do about this? thanks. can you not claim off your travel insurance? thanks for your quick reply. i have been unable to find a list of what constitutes a reasonable or unavoidable delay. hence the post here. i agree about not spending thousands to recoup . have to check their carrie agreement about what sort of thing would constitute a reasonable or avoidable or unavoidable delay. beyond that it likely that you bound yourself to arbitration by purchasing the ticket but have to check the specifics of your agreement for that too. start there and see what you find before you go spending potentially thousands on legal fees to recoup usd.
