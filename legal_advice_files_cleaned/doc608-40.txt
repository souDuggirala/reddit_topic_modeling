if this the place for this point me in the right directions cause i know where to post this. i'm a bartender at an upscale movie theater that provides service to guests in cinema. on a typical weekend night we have decent staffing: bartenders servers for the cinemas cocktailers for the lounge food runners people who deliver food and ushers people who clean the cinemas . sometimes when business is slow during the weekdays they have the morning bartender do all of these jobs to save on labor but i'm still only being paid $8 hr plus tips which can fluctuate which is my standard morning pay switches over to $6 at night because tips are better in the pm to make up for less pay . is this illegal or is my business just finding loopholes to get out of scheduling employees to do their jobs. op it sounds more like you need to find a new job. nothing illegal or even a loophole is happening per your narrative. it not a loophole it just legal.
