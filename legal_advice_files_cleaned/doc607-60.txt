my dad has battled bipolar disorde personality disorder for awhile. he has gone in and out of the hospital a few times. he went on a few binges and bought a motorcycle and took off and toured the us he lost his job get a psychiatrist to keep him on because threaten them and bought lots of frivolous things while my mom frantically followed behind him picking up the pieces. he has no memory of any of this. he finally got stable found a good medication that works and got his job back. we thought all was finally well until we got a call from the irs that we owe them 15 30k from early withdrawal fees interest and taxes since my mom never included that money in her tax filings. she know he even did that and we have no idea where it went. obviously we plan on paying the money we have to back but like to avoid paying the extras for not reporting it. we have all the documentation from my dad being admitted to the hospital. they were nice and said my mom could file a report with everything and it should be fine but she just told me it looks like denying everything. they really have any money for a lawyer as they spent their savings when he was out of a job and now have a ton of medical debt. is there anything i can do
