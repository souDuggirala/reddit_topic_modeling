hello so my question is this: a mother is receiving back child support from an ex husband whose kids are now over 18. the amount she gets is between $50 $100 due to the mans job. she and her kids 20 22 are in low income apartments. lease came in and rent is at $1k even though only two members of the house are working and only bring in $1.2k combined per paycheck. the reason for the high rent is credited as the child support payments as they are supposed to be getting about $250. is this legal
