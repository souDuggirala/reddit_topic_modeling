hello so my question is this: a mother is receiving back child support from an ex husband whose kids are now over . the amount she gets is between due to the mans job. she and her kids are in low income apartments. lease came in and rent is at even though only two members of the house are working and only bring in . combined per paycheck. the reason for the high rent is credited as the child support payments as they are supposed to be getting about . is this legal??
