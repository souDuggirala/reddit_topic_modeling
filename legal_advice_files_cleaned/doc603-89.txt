so i went through google third party provider "ubreakifix" to fix my phone. they had to change out the motherboard and they changed the imei in doing so. i transfer the phone from verizon all though it paid in full. i feel like stalling and want to know what i can do to make sure the phone is unlocked as verizon said they help and google stated that the process takes a week. what do i do? it sounds like you may just have to wait the week that google said.
