first sorry if i used the wrong flair. second slightly rushed and on mobile. clean up as i can. but i work as a software developer. i recently acquired a job for someone willing to pay at a rate that would equate to about $400 for the finished product. my "friend" over here who i initially allowed to help collaborate decided at the last second to run off and present the existing code and programs as his work and his own. he have access to everything meaning some parts are either broken or rewritten from scratch. but besides that he scrubbed my name from everything slightly changed the style and tried to pin me for plagarizing his work and therefore he the one that gets paid not me. the money my concern. my concern is that when i attempt to resolve this with the client i worked for convinced what he says is truth. he knows he can do this because i lack the funds to afford a lawyer. at this point i'm certain need to take legal action but where do i start i assume some form of copyright law for the record i'm based in indiana and he in the netherlands making this the nightmare that is international disputes.
