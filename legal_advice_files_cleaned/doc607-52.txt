first off not sure what to flair this sorry. secondly my girlfriend had a mental breakdown at work she works at a nursing home and her supervisor constantly puts her on a floor she a tech where there is one resident that constantly sexually harrases her and makes moves towards her. is there any legal thing that she can do if they do not move her floors or reprimand the resident the eeoc has successfully sued private health care facilities in the past when residents were sexually harassing employees and the employer failed to act. your girlfriend needs to make her employer aware of the conduct and keep records of every time she notified them. if they continue to fail to do anything about it she can file a charge with the eeoc. restraining order if the resident actually does anything illegal.
