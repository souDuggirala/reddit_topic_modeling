my parents rights are being removed and i cannot get a clear answer if i will be able to go to college for free if i choose to be adopted over staying on plc. i have been living with my grabdparents for 4 years and they have had seco dary custody. first off sorry to hear about your fluctuating family situation i hope things improve under the permanent care of your grandparents. second ianal and i am in tx not pa so grain of salt here . in tx the free tuition for state schools only applies to those who were adopted from the foster system by an non biological adoptive family and does not apply to kinship adoption in which an extended biological family member adopts the child . i am not sure if this applies to you or not obviously you could have been in the foster system before landing with your biological grandparents 4 years ago. in your post you imply that being on plc would grant you free tuition. what is the program in pa that grants free college for those on plc is there a website with contact info for administrators of this program that you could try and get in touch with to answer this question as a parent with adopted kids it seems counter intuitive that a program would no longer be open to you based on finding a forever home with your grandparents it not like that changes any of the hardships you likely endured in your time before then. here are some resources for you to look through: even if you get to get your costs waived based on your custody status you may be eligible for many grants or vouchers through these state and federal programs. best of luck and god bless. i think anyone here will be able to say if still be able to get free college without knowing why you are eligible for that in the first place. your grandparentsâ€™ income will be counted against you if adopted if that what asking. if low income you may still be able to get assistance.
