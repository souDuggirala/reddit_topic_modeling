 pennsylvania i have a contract with a uniform company that supplies work uniforms in addition to cleaning them and re delivering them to my business every week. i am unsatisfied with the service the past few months and would like to cancel. my problem is that i signed the contract over a decade ago. a few months ago an employee of the company tried to get me to renew the contract at a delivery but i refused. they have continued dropping off the uniforms and i have been paying regardless of never renewing the initial contract. if the contract has expired can i settle up what i owe with them refuse the next delivery and be done with them? no one at the company is returning my calls. thanks for the help! if your contract terms did not have “auto renewal” clause then you should be free and clear. read your contract to ascertain what your obligations are to confirm cancellation of service if none to cover your butt send them a letter advising them of your desire to cancel effective xxx date along with a check to cover the last service end date. make sure you send it so that it is trackable and save all documents. be sure to quote your contract # etc. personally i would also follow up with an email.
