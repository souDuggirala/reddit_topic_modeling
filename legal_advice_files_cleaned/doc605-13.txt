my downstairs neighbor insists in sending her grandchildren to play on the garage which is strictly prohibited in the rules of my condominium. i care because 1 the kids play unsupervised the majority of the time which is dangerous. 2 the garage is right under my window so there a lot of noise which prevents me from working or studying at peace. manager says he " believe in taking extreme actions such as fining" and that he already talked to her and she claimed to have stopped. i then start to make videos to prove that she and send them to the manager via whatsapp. he is now ignoring my calls and messages. what do i do i'm in brazil and i understand most people here know brazilian law but i'm wondering if in general this is worth fighting for.
