i signed a roof top solar contract december 4 yesterday for a 10 kw system. over the emails i asked for specific equipment 30 lg neon 2 panels solar edge 11400 hd inverter full install essentially. i did not review the contract as carefully as i should have and some of the model numbers differ from what i requested via email. the contract indicates a solaredge 11400a us inverter which is actually discontinued. via email i was very specific about wanting the hd model which iâ€™m sure costs more. also the panels are simply called lg neon vs neon2. i feel like i was misled and been trying to get in touch with the contractor all day 2 calls voicemails and emails. there is not a specific cancellation clause in the contract and i have not paid a dime yet. am i in the clear to ask for a cancellation citing the ftc 3 day cool down clause with no fault. no expenses have been incurred on there part as it been less than 24 hours.
