so i sold my house in july the buyers were an all around pain in the ass about every single thing. i lived in fountain so we got hit by multiple hail storms during this process which only made matters worse. months after the last storm after closing and i was out of state i got a call from my realtor telling me the buyers wanted me to pay for the damage because the storm happened when i still owned it. this was months after the storm so i was confused but decided look into it. everything was fine i was able to make the claims and receive the money. but during this time the buyers had not transferred the energy bill into their name causing me to have to pay for their electricity bills which in total came out to ~ . i told the buyers i would send them insurance money minus the dollars now they are bitching about that and only want to pay . i am frustrated because i have been doing everything trying to get them this money and now they are complaining about this. my question is if i am even legally obligated to give them this insurance money? am i allowed to just pocket it? thanks in advance. insurance $$ is about ~ if you were paid an insurance settlement for damage to a house made while under contract but before actually sold to the buyer you almost certainly cannot pocket that money. if they owe you money for energy bills i guess you might deduct that from what you send them and leave it to them to litigate that issue if they desire. in the future you should disconnect utilities effective the day of closing.
