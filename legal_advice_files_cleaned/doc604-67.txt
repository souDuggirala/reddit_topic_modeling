 we know the value of the trees. but if it is a triple damages state and triple damages is 200k that will be the payout. unless there is some "it doesnt count if they say it was by accident" clause you are refering to fuck i love these also if your mom done so already take photos of the damage and from a couple of different angles. inal but more proof is better than no proof just in case something goes wrong. get a damage estimate from an arborist and contractor and then contact the township with your damages and ask for their insurance. alternatively contact your homeowner insurance and have them start the process. first steps are to talk to an arborist for the trees shrubs and contractor for the fence to get a sense of what the monetary value of the damages are then either talk to the city township and perhaps their insurance if any and failing that an attorney about those damages.
