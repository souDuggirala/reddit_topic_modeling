hey all #x200b; i'm currently writing an essay for a university class. the essay is on the opioid pandemic and how it is compounded affected by the mental health crisis happening concurrently. my mother who works as an er and hospitalist doctor at the local hospital would have a wealth of information on this topic. the requirements state that i need at least one primary source that is a person as well as a few more primary secondary and tertiary sources . as stated before i would like to use my mother as a primary source in this matter. i work at said university as a cancer research assistant and have volunteered at the hospital so hippa is my main concern since they really throw the book at you in those cases. i was wondering if asking my mother for personal anecdotes all identifying information completely excluded would be a direct violation of the hippa act. #x200b; thanks! #x200b; my bad was typing it up in a hurry actually in the middle of an experiment currently haha. thanks! if she gets so generic as to not reveal any identifying information about a patient she run afoul of hipaa . a cancer research assistant should know the proper acronym. ;
