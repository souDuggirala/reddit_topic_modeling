i recently started getting my wages garnished for medical debt to a hospital that refused to treat me irrelevant but i felt it important to mention . i have a usual work year though and i'm wondering how it will effect the garnishment. essentially i get fired laid off for about 6 8 weeks and then rehired at the beginning of the new work season. new background check and drug test and onboarding process and all. when i am rehired since it is the same company will the garnishment resume from that first check coming back or will i have a few weeks while the collection agency has to refile paperwork
