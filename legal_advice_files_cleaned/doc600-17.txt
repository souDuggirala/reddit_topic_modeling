pretty much as title explains i got a ticket in pa for running a stop sign. i paused slowed but come to a complete stop no denying it. officer explained how the ticket works and said it would be 3 points on my license and a fine. i told him i would plead guilty stupid i know since i knew i messed up and want to lie about it. ticket is $150 which sucks but not impossible to afford. just wondering if there something i should can do to get it reduced or keep points off my license if i get the points will it mess with my insurance the cop said if i plead not guilty at court i would probably get the points removed. just not sure if the price of a lawyer and court fees would be worth it i always get an attorney he keeps stuff off my record lowers fines keeps points off ect. i know if running a stop sign is as big a deal as speeding though. you can plead no contest and ask the magistrate to withhold the points if you have a decent driving history. then your insurance rates may not go up. you need a lawyer for this just a day off work to show up at the courthouse on your hearing date. just plead not guilty. the court usually lowers it to just a fine. you do not want points on your license even just a fine can raise your insurance. you can talk to a paralegal about this but you probably need a lawyer when you go to court. you have no defense. this is the penalty. pay it and pay more attention when you drive.
