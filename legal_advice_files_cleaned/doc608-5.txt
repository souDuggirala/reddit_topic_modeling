i had a reservation booked through their condo website without a signed lease in a new condo built this year and they fired the girl who gave me permission to stay only 5 months instead of the 7 minimum . now they are coming back saying it florida law that the minimum lease in florida is 7 months which i think is bs and they have to charge me if i decide to cancel the last 2 months any input on this the only confirmation i had from the girl was verbal got it thanks if you agreed to rent the unit for 7 months in a clear agreement the oral promise to cut the agreement short at 5 months probably going to be enforceable. basically price unit move in date and length 7 months : there is a tourist tax in florida on rentals of six months or less. so while it not perfectly true that the law prevents them from leasing for 5 months it is true that there are additional complications making understandable the minimum 7. what are the terms of the agreement you made with them not the verbal offer to cut short but the demonstrable agreement you made
