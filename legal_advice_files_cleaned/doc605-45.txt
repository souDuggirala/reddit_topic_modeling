last night i was in an altercation. nothing physical and no citations were given and no arrest were made. however i was intoxicated and the police made a report that i am currently in the process of requesting. if the record is something along the lines of saying i was publicly intoxicated or disturbed the peace would that show up if a company runs a background check on me. i'm in michigan btw. edit: also if i was not charged for anything at the time is it possible to be charged with something like this at a later date say if cameras are viewed and it determined i was being disorderly before the police came if a report was merely taken that is never going to show up on a standard background check. need to have been issued a citation or charged with a crime or processed at the police station in order to possibly show up on a background check.
