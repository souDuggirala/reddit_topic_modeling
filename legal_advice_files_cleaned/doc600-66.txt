let me start by saying i have been a lurker for a long time. i dont understand laws and how they can affect us but because of all of you i was able to work up the confidence and file a formal complaint with the eeoc regarding the failure to provide a work place accommodation for my lbs weight restrictions. i know i just opened a can of worms im by no means ready for but for someone who suffers with major depression this was a huge step for me. the first of many i believe however over the year reading your stories and comments has givin me enough knowledge to reach out and i was right! they were in violation of ada. so from one lurker to the rest of you thank you. here is to hoping i dont need surgery. mods sorry if i broke the rules i looked but couldnt find it any where. p.s. excuse my typos im on mobile and i havent taken my pain meds for my shoulder as i spent + hrs driving to their office and wasnt comfortable doing so on them. im gonna go get some icyhot and take them now. have good day! üëè
