five months ago i was in a bad car crash when a woman ran a red light and hit my car head on as i was turning left. the x rays were fine and no surgeries were needed i hope but i did have bad whiplash and multiple bruises. the lasting damage came in the form of torn cartilage and microfractures in my wrist and some slow healing bone bruises in my knee that were discovered in separate mris. i had several orthopedist visits and occupational physical therapy appointments as well. from talking to attorneys several would not take the case because they said my injuries severe enough to warrant huge medical bills. one lawyer actually explained to me that car insurance companies in texas pay any "pain and suffering" money in texas. all they are liable to pay is your medical bills. the take home "settlement" for an injured not at fault driver comes from the attorney reducing the medical bills which the client then pockets the difference and the attorney takes his cut of the difference. from what he said it sounded like the attorney even negotiate with the car insurance co just the medical companies. another attorney had a similar explanation. after the reductions that my medical insurance placed on the providers the total medical bills right now is only a few thousand which would make any difference to pocket next to nothing. but i have seen some websites in texas mention a "multiplier" effect with the "multiplier" being anywhere to times the medical bills. anyone experienced with car accident liability in texas know which is correct? also what happens if i decide to have arthroscopic wrist surgery in the future? is there a way i can accept a settlement from progressive yet still have them pay for a surgery in the future if it needed or if i elect to have it?
