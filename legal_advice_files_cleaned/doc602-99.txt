i’m living in france but i did an internship in malta for months. i went to an estate agency there and an agent found a nice apartment for me. months go by and on the day that i’m supposed to meet the landlord give her back the keys and get my deposit back € she show up! return my calls either unfortunately she knew that i had to leave the country and she took advantage of it. the agent said he told her to give me back my money but she clearly has no intention to do it. i have her name number and the name of her husband. possibly even her address but nothing more what can i do here?
