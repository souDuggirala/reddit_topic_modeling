last night a group of punk rockers were drinking and smoking around my car. my car was parked on the street. neighbor called the cops. this morning i went to go check up on my car and it has scratches on the paint of the hood. what can i do to pursuit this. iâ€™m upset because i got the car 2 weeks ago if the cops came out you can open records request any reports that were made. this might have their names and addresses to take them to small claims. though with out witnesses it will be hard to prove it was them. do you have comp coverage on your insurance file a claim if damages exceeds your deductible
