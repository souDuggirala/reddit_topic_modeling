somebody has hacked my account and has tried to order a bunch of food with it. cancelled the orders before i was charged and have reset my password so he use my account anymore. now i want to make sure this guy stops doing this. i have his name and his address from his delivery info. who do i need to call or what do i need to do to report this guy. thanks in advance! edit i’m in missouri and he is in florida you can call the police in his jurisdiction in florida and report the crime to them since they are the ones who could potentially do something about it. it is also potentially something the fbi could investigate since there are federal cybercrime statutes he has likely violated and this crime was across state lines. you can call your local fbi field office and bring them up to speed as well. they may not do too much about this specific incident but at the very least they can get a file started on this guy and take action if it a recurring activity. i would recommend filing a report about safety hacked account on postmates’ website under the ‘help’ section. additionally sending all screenshots evidence you have is a must. you attach in in the original message but send you an email with a confirmation they received your report and you can send the attachments by replying to the email. the hacker get in trouble but postmates can ban him from ordering again if they have his ips address name. change your passwords and maybe your email if you have an alternative. if he had access to your account he also saw your name and address so keep that in mind. source: i make a lot of fake accounts with fake numbers and use the promos for free delivery. dealt with postmates customer service a lot.
