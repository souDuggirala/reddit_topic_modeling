serious question. i live in compact west hollywood basically los angeles but separate and i’m between a quiet residential street but next to a busy street. there is a tiny law office across the fence from my bedroom window. recently they set up a pop up basketball hoop and every sunday i am forced to listen to the sound of multiple balls bouncing all around in a cacophony but i am telling you it is akin to being able to hear just the bass of someone music. instead of being cute and endearing it is driving me mad. they are playing in the middle of the day so i call it a noise complaint. but i’m also wondering if they can legally put the hoop there on their properly albeit it 10 feet maybe even less from my bedroom window. if they are allowed to can i fight back by being annoying myself on my apartment property blare porn noise or air horns or something the people playing basketball are probably between 16 25 years old. tell. thoughts legit question lol. i promise i’m not being petty or ornery. it unbearable. no amount of tv or music sounds can stop it. the words quiet enjoyment do not mean what you think they mean. you actually can call in a noise complaint. the time of day matter it the annoyance. you have a right to quiet enjoyment in your home and if that being violated phone it in. ask them to be quiet. you will probably get in trouble for blasting an air horn on a consistent basis and you have no idea if “porn noise” would drive these guys away. go down introduce yourself and ask them if they can move the hoop farther away from your window. go over and tell them to be quiet i promise i’m not being petty or ornery. it unbearable. yeah you are. in any event you would need to look and see if there are local ordinances about amplified sound. just being during the day a license to make whatever noise you want.
