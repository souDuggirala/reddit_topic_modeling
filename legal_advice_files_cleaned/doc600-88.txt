me and a partner were going to buy a house for . needed work and the after repair value is . we signed a basic purchase and sales agreement there are specific scenarios where either party can back out and none of them were met. the seller messaged me saying “ sold the house sorry” and she been mia since then. can i sue her to either force the sale or receive compensation since this was a move done in bad faith? did your basic selle agreement have any language containing something to the effect of "contingent w no kickout?" this is used to prevent the situation you are in right now. it prevents the seller from taking another offer while you are working on closing with them. she showed me her mortgage paperwork and we were inside the house so yes gotta ask is the "seller" indeed the homeowner. this has the feel of the start of a scam. no earnest money down but we incurred other expenses. estimate drive time cost. and it through an agent. house officially on the market we scooped it up before it hit. these kind of issues can be difficult to parse especially if the agreements were diy and neither of you used an agent. like i said running everything by a real estate lawyer may be worth your time. were you using an real estate agent to help facilitate the sale? was the seller using an agent? ninja edit was any earnest money out down? i’m just trying to figure out an avenue i can take. pa this will depend on the language in your purchase agreement. it may be worth it to run it by a real estate attorney but getting a specific performance judgement may be difficult. location?
