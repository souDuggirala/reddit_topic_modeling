a guy i used to be involved with has recently decided to start posting pornographic pictures videos of me online. he has also started sending them to my parents. i have reported him to the police in the past for harassing me and sending packages to my house. i'm not sure where to start to figure out which kind of lawyer i would need to talk to or even how to find one. google has been less than helpful. i appreciate that. 3
