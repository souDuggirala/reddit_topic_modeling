i recently had a vendor for a private event fail to deliver on their services. i'm working on getting a refund without going to court but i'm being met with some resistance so i'm now contemplating filing in small claims court. the question is if i reside in ny the vendor resides in nj and the event took place in nj where should i file? thank you. you would need to file wherever the defendant place of business is located.
