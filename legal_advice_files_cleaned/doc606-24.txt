my sister and her husband recently got into a fight and decided they were over. they filed for a divorce. it was to the point that my sister feel comfortable living in the same house as him so she asked him to leave but he . he has lived in her house for the past month but he is not on the lease and he is not listed as a tenant. she called the cops because he leave but they said they force him out. my sister has been living with my mom for the past week while her husband has been living rent free in her place while also having an affair with a neighbor. it seems insane that there is nothing she can do. is there anything she can do legally thank you talk to her about that location matters but assuming a generic us location she will have to go through the formal eviction process. give him notice 30 days that his subtenancy is being terminated and if he is not out by then file for eviction through the local courts. once that is approved then law enforcement will help remove him.
