my mother just passed away recently and my father may be getting remarried in the future. he mentioned before about setting me up as a trustee in the event of his death to manage his estate. would that still work if he got remarried or is something like a prenup required? ok. thanks. i'm pretty sure he would just set it up for me to divvy everything up because i'm the responsible one in the family i'm just concerned how a potential marriage could play into it. depends on how the trust is set up. in many cases a spouse may be set up as a life tenant meaning she gets the income from assets during her life. if you are the successor trustee you would still manage the trust. but of course the grantor i.e. your dad could set up the trust however he wanted to. i'm not a lawyer this is just my experience with and understanding of trusts. she may that why you need it to involve a lawyer. say his will states that you get all money she could be entitled to his possessions and vice versa. man that a lawyer question. so the new wife have rights to his assets? i believe you would still be the trustee but it needs to be in writing notarized and on file with a lawyer.
