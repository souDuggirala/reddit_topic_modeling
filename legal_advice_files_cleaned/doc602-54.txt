sorry if this the right area to post but i'm really annoyed at a driver who hit into my girlfriends car which has caused damaged to the front wheel arch and door. i have the cctv footage of the van but the registration plate is really bright and unable to read. thus why maybe someone can help me to fix the blur brightness around the registration plate it not fair that the person is question tell her about it and drove off. the number on the van tried to calling but no answer i'm presuming they want to speak to anymore until it calmed down . #x200b; what else should can we do #x200b; any help guys would be really appreciated this has really hit us hard when we have much money especially when christmas is around the corner. #x200b; i will update this post with the video if of course this is allowed here they uk have a ton of cctv all over the place request it from whatever entity controls them in the direction of travel. understood thank you. i doubt anyone here can help you undo the light exposure in a video. your legal options are to call your insurer or try to find another way to identify this person to file suit. my girlfriends car access is rather quite high and afford to pay the damages on her own. thus why getting the registration plate with help due to the light exposure will not put us in the brunt of paying the damages as we just afford it now. call your insurance company and file a claim. that what it for
