at my school the teachers are falsley acusing me of bathroom griffiti. their only evidence is that some of the hand writing looks a little similar to mine. i tried explaining to them that when i walked into the bathroom i saw the graffiti but that do anything. i'm most likely going to get suspended for something i do also why would they care so much about this bathroom grafiti when i see grafiti in a lot of bathrooms nowadays. did i mention they are trying to get the police involved and do a criminal investigation. i really need your help. my parents met with the principal today but even if the police came how would they find out if it was me or not i am worried because the people that went into the bathroom before i did who were the ones who did it lied and said they didnt see any grafiti meanwhile i was the first person who admited to seing the grafiti and that makes me look like i did it
