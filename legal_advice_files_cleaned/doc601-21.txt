is there any recourse against the supermarket or the farm itself how would one proceed it sucks to have a lifelong disability after consuming a nationally recalled product. i understand it probably fact specific like when the lettuce was pulled from the vendo it was consumed. i was hoping for some legal guidance. thank you. there something fishy going on. last time i checked there was the e. coli responsible for the romaine lettuce outbreak o157:h7 which known to cause lifelong ulcerative colitis but can cause things like hus and there is the salmonella outbreak related to beef. think there was a recent salmonella outbreak regarding iceberg lettuce. “colitis” and “chronic ulcerative colitis” are not the same thing. what the actual diagnosis he could try contacting a personal injury lawyer. they would know whether he would have a case or not.
