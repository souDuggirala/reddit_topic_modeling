recently a construction company replacing what appear to be water lines has been operating in my neighborhood. today however they decided to dig up my grass park their bulldozers and equipment on my lawn which have left deep treadmarks and leave piles of dirt on my property which will inevitable kill the grass underneath. given it winter where i live north of atlanta there is zero chance the grass will grow back before spring. i feel this is a rediculous situation which has damaged my property and caused numerous headaches. what are my options for dealing with this here a link to some photos: give it time to grow. it only grass man. it called municipal road allowance. find out who the city project manager is and call them. they will usually replace your grass as part of the project costs. you probably should have gotten some notification of the project before construction sometimes they can be posted on your water bill. ianal but am an engineer and the contractor is indeed probably on the hook. yes so basically i'm going to have to pay out of pocket to repair my yard this is within the city utility easement. based on the first picture you have they did dress the site up as best as possible considering this are very heavy machines and it in the winter. as far as recourse there is none you can take.
