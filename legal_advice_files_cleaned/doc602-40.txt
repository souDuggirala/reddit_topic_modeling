iâ€™m 15 been wanting to get emancipated. been working since i was 13 babysitting cleaning houses etc and now i have a real reliable job and have for 7 months. i want to get emancipated because i basically support my mom i buy her what she needs when she needs she in unemployed. basically has been my whole life. she always borrows money from me and never pays me back. occasionally she will give me rides to work but when not i walk. rather sleep than do anything parent related. she also has the biggest gambling problem. before you move out if you are not in an abusive situation make sure you have one month of rent and utilities socked away. jobs go away. you do not want to be a homeless 15 year old girl. research if your state has any benefits for minors to live independently. make sure you get at least your high school diploma. do not trust everyone you encounter or announce to people you live alone. this will allow predators in to your life. moved out at 16. with the amount of money i hand out definitely adds up to it. i already do buy groceries as is. i am in school i do online school! can you afford to pay rent utilities and groceries car insurance are you in school i think your first call should be to cps to discuss this. at the age of 15 emancipation would be an uphill battle but you could speak with a family attorney about it. #x200b;
