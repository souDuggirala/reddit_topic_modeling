i paid rent yesterday admittedly one day past the apartment complex grace period. however when i went and paid they charge me a late fee. they often enforce the late fee. i got a receipt and left. today trying to say i have to pay them the late fee. i'm arguing that since they accepted the payment without charging the fee they come back later and charge me. do i have a case if so is their any legal precedent i could cite to try and get them to back down also i live in mississippi if that matters i'm arguing that since they accepted the payment without charging the fee they come back later and charge me. good argument but it likely work. there nothing in the law that says they have to charge you the late fee at the exact same time you pay rent late and if they do that then they forfeit their ability to collect the late fee.
