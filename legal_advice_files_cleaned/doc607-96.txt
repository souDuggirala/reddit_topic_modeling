a year and a half ago there was a fire in the oven at the home we were renting in ontario. we were using it to melt wax in a metal pot. there was about 15.000 in damages partly because the firefighters poured multiple pounds of liquid wax down the sink. the oven was wrecked as well. when i first got a notice from the insurance a year ago i left a voicemail saying it was unclear what exactly caused the fire and i do not accept liability. no reply and over a year later they said if we pay them they will file legal action in 10 days. they said we did not reply to a letter from june 1st which none of us received. we all now live somewhere else i left another voicemail today saying again i do not see how i am liable. any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated. thanks. my clear legal question is: am i liable for my landlords property being damaged if the cause of the fire be proved if the cause of the fire be proved why do you think the cause is a mystery you think there no record of the firefighters having found flaming wax in the kitchen
