i would like to file a small claim to collect c$26k from ex boyfriend. i lent him c$40k to start his own business and was paid back c$25k after 4 months. and i lent again c$15k to pay for unexpected expense for the company. the balance of his owing is about c$26k as of today. all i want is to set a payment schedule and be able to seize his account when he neglects payment. been keeping his book since his company started. the money i lent him is all accounted in it. if it possible i would like to claim my missed wages since been working for him for free. i would like someone to educate me on small claim procedure. thank you. thank you. probably i'm misunderstanding the role of lawyer. this whole thing is very informative. a lawyer enforce a judgement. the courts do. this is a great information to intake! thank you! one thing do i have to be accompanied by a lawyer to enforce the judgement this should lay out how to get your started.
