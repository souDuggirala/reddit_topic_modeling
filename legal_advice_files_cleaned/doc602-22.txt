hey all. i got behind on a bill and sent to a debt collector and was sent a summons in the mail. however in the summons on the bottom it stated “this is an attempt to collect a debt”. it was in regards to without prejudice. i’m attempting to contact them to figure this out but that proving futile. am to show up it looks false. i’m not sure what without prejudice is meaning in regards to this. call the court clerk and ask them if they can explain. ignore it you could end up getting a default judgment against you. write to the debt colletion agency by certified mail return receipt and ask for written validation of the debt such as the original application and an accounting of all costs fees etc to show how they came up with the balance. i have checked the court docket and i am no where on it if you got a dismissal in the mail it would absolutely be prudent to contact the court and ensure the dismissal was filed and the case was dismissed. it was a dismissal my apologies. am to show up it looks false. what does the summons say and what leads you to believe it is false in most cases you need to file an answer or appear on the court date or risk a default judgment entered against you. you can undoubtedly call the court referenced on the summons to verify if a case has been filed. on the bottom it stated “this is an attempt to collect a debt”. that common. it was in regards to without prejudice. more context is needed around this language. is it a summons or a dismissal cases are dismissed without prejudice meaning that they can be refiled. as opposed to dismissed with prejudice meaning the plaintiff cannot raise that cause of action again in the future. i would call the entity you owe the debt to and pay it directly to them if possible. this would avoid any court date.
