my girlfriend not i as she reddit was the one involved. there documentation of the price being listed and agreed to as $900. a $600 deposit was placed after seeing the apartment in person. today was the day to sign the lease and it was sent digitally which seems odd. the signatures on it are fake. the rent was jacked up to $1 400. the realtor she had been in contact with has become incredibly unprofessional. a direct quote is word for word “without you sign the lease 4 people will now be homeless ” so being that this what was agreed to or expected at all is there anything we can do besides not signing the lease obviously is that $600 all but gone is there any where to report this company or “realtor” to it could be either. if she renting just the room she would be given a separate lease from the other occupants with just her portion of rent on it. if the five people are together renting the entire apartment they would likely get one lease for the entire apartment with the one overall rent and any separate apportionments between the different people would not be part of that contract. not sure if well versed in real estate but if a room is being presented as one of five rooms within an apartment being rented out the lease being signed should be for individual amount or for the group amount in better terms should the lease she signing say $5 000 for the whole apartment split amongst the group or $1 000 just for her i’m sorry if that comes across confusing. small claims for the $600 deposit and you can report the realtor to the real estate board. this assumes the person is an actual licensed real estate professional. you can sue for your $600 back.
