 my gf was sold a car by a family friend for fairly cheap paid for it in cash the seller kept a copy of the registration and put my gfs info on it name address we needed money so decided to resell the vehicle for more money online we forged a bill of sale stupid i know from the original owner to the new buyer and get a copy of the bill of sale very stupid i know . now the problem is the new guy must not have registered it in his name got a ticket in said car it was sent to the family friend so he went to dmv and showed his copy of registration saying it was sold to my gf and dmv said take care of it for him. if a ticket from this guy shows up at our doorstep what should i do you committed multiple crimes and should contact an attorney if anything about this ever comes up.
