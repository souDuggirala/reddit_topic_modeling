so i am buying a house and and currently have 7 months left on my lease. i’m pretty sure i was told that if i cut the lease i would have to pay monthly until someone moved in. now i’m told i have to pay the remainder. i have the money for this on top of buying a house. it does not talk about cutting of a lease in the lease document.
