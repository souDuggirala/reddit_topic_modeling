i'm in the final semester of my college career and have already landed a full time job in texas. i also applied for my citizenship about 6 months ago and am currently getting processed. a month ago i was stopped for speeding and was caught with unprescribed adderall on me. i gave the officer consent to search and told him where it was and because of this he decided not to arrest me and instead gave me a paraphernalia ticket which i understand is a class c misdemeanor in texas. i have since gotten an attorney but they were unable to get the ticket dismissed. i am now looking to do deferred adjudication to have it removed from my record but i understand this still makes me eligible for deportation. as someone who has been in this country nearly my entire life i am pretty terrified of being deported. i made some very stupid decisions and have since learned my lesson. how likely is it that the government will build a case against me to deport me
