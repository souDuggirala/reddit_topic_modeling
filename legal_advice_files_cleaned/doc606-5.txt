i live in ma and am planning on moving to nh with my boyfriend. he has already purchased a house and legally has to move there in january. the problem is that i have a minor child who father not my bf heard that i was moving and decided to fight it his grounds being he think it ok for her to move in the middle of the school year. i have a lawyer and he thinks i should be okay with this. i would typically be okay with this except i want to move in with my bf of o st r years and i am pregnant and due in june before the end of the school year. it kills me to think that i will have to spend most of my pregnancy without the father of my child. up to and including not being able to live together for the first month of our child life. has anyone been through this what can i do to help expedite the move so i can be settled before the little one comes into this world. what can i do to help me probe that this is going to benefit my child oh also my minor child father already lives in nh. then you should be able to move after the school year is over as your attorney noted. the court will not consider your pregnancy when making its decision. it every other weekend. i am not moving any further than i live now. it will not effect his parenting time is there visitation or custody for the father at all if so i doubt the judge would allow you to move with the child. it is not his fault that you decided to become pregnant with another child.
