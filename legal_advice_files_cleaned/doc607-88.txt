a year and a half ago there was a fire in the oven at the home we were renting in ontario. we were using it to melt wax in a metal pot. there was about 15.000 in damages partly because the firefighters poured multiple pounds of liquid wax down the sink. the oven was wrecked as well. when i first got a notice from the insurance a year ago i left a voicemail saying it was unclear what exactly caused the fire and i do not accept liability. no reply and over a year later they said if we pay them they will file legal action in 10 days. they said we did not reply to a letter from june 1st which none of us received. we all now live somewhere else i left another voicemail today saying again i do not see how i am liable. any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated. thanks. please review the landlord tenant questions section of the wiki for common questions and answers regarding landlord tenant issues. if this does not apply to your question please disregard. i am a bot and this action was performed automatically. please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to= if you have any questions or concerns.
