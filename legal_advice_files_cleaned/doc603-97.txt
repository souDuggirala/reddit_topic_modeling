so i posted in tifu with the story but i slipped on some unseen ice and broke my arm when getting my mail. someone in the comments suggested i bill the apartment for my hospital visit is this something i can do? i know i approached the maintenance guy and he saw me right after it happened so they know. the leasing office lady called me and filling an incident report but i know what that would entail. any help guys? thank you so much! missouri is a pure comparative fault state which means got a case! contact an attorney that does slip and fall cases asap and give any statements or anything to your building or maintenance from here on out. just updated with my location i'm in the kansas city missouri area. i do have to have surgery in which i have an appointment for this coming monday what state? slip and falls are common subjects of lawsuits but the viability depends on a fair number of factors if the broken arm requires surgery most attorneys will take the case if not some attorneys will say no since its not as strong a case. you can probably get representation but just remember if you are going to do that an attorney just interested in recouping your med bills they work on contingency fee so it could be a drawn out process and they will expect you to get treatment to increase the value of the claim.
