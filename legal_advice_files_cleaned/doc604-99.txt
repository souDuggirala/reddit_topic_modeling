i parked my vehicle in a private commercial parking spot my mistake and it was towed. i fully accept responsibility for that part. i went to pick up my car today paid for the release and noticed the engine running abnormally loud. i took it to the mechanic who said the muffler was damaged. i highly suspect the car was damaged during towing. how should i proceed details: car was last maintained and inspected a month prior for winter tires. no issues with muffler then. car last driven 2 days ago no issues then. towing was initiated by the commercial property who contacted city by law. i have a parking ticket from by law but the towing was done by a third party private company. the release i signed for the car does not include any language about damage or liability. ah shucks i think of that. i mentioned the problem to the front desk and they gave me an email to file a report which i did. do you have any proof that the damage was done by the towing company once you drive it off the lot you lose a lot of ability to say they caused the damage. one of the reasons i always tell people to document any damages and maybe even call their insurance company prior to taking their vehicle off the tow lot.
