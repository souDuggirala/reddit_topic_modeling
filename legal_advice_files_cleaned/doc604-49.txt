i am looking to break my lease. i am signed on until august but the two people that i live with are an absolute fucking nightmare. they bullies extremely unhygienic they smoke in the house even though i have asthma and go into a coughing fit every time they do and they are just extremely extremely undesirable to live with. how hard is it to break my lease how do i tell my landlord i have photographic evidence of the "unhygienic" things i am talking about. please help however you can. i mean it hurt to talk to your landlord but yeah i count on your ll being super happy about letting you the most responsible and likely to pay for damages out of the lease on your own. but it hurt to ask. i checked and it read " you will still be liable for the entire lease term should you move out early." fuck. this is my first time living on my own. i'm gonna go ahead and assume that landlords tend to show mercy and that there is no way to get around this. are you in a joint lease with these people or separate leases also where read your lease to see if it outlines what happens if you terminate early.
