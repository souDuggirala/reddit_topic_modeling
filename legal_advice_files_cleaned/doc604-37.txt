nevada i was granted temporary sole legal and physical custody of my child 2 years ago. the judge verbally said temporary which my lawyer stated usually meant a year. however it say temporary on the final order and there is no time frame listed on any of my paperwork. if it been challenged by the other parent do i still have sole legal and physical custody thank you so much. we intend to visit a lawyer after the holidays. i appreciate your response. termination of parental rights is possible but is expensive and requires a lawyer. i recommend adult adoption if possible because you can still get child support from the noncustodial parent and it much simpler. i am now married and my spouse wants to adopt said child. do we need the permission of the non custodial parent go ahead. i have a follow up if you mind and are a lawyer yes.
