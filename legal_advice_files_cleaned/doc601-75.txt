i have a question about divorce the deceased and who will inherheit the deceased assets. i have any involvement in this at all i'm just curious on what will happen. the situation: my gf mom is separated from her husband after years. she cheated on him and they split up . the divorce was in process. the mom refused to finalize the divorce though because the husband is now dying of cancer and was afraid she would lose all inheritance from him once he died shitty i know . the husband has a house she is after once he gone retirement and other things. but also has a will that he probably left everything to his sons i'm guessing. gfs mom is already chomping at the bit for him to die so she can get his house and money. will she get anything if the divorce was not finalized but left everything to his sons? will she get anything if the divorce was not finalized but left everything to his sons? yes. she can renounce the will = and receive part of what she would have received = if he had died without a will. kentucky location?
