i am renting one side of a duplex in norman oklahoma. i have dogs and one of the reasons i chose this property is for the backyard. the previous landlords had divided the backyard with a fence that gave me around 80% of the backyard. the property was sold to a new landlord who decided to put in a fence that only give me about 50% of the backyard. i given notice of this other than this text exchange below: landlord: thank you. btw we are installing a fence in the backyard today. please make sure your dogs are inside. me: all right would i be within my rights to seek a lowered rent i asked about this modification beforehand. i thought the fence he was referring to meant he was fixing a broken fence in the backyard. did i screw myself over with that text i said all right meaning that i would keep my dogs inside but i can see it being ambiguous. the lease specifically mention the yard but it is connected to my back door and not to the other half of the duplex. thanks unless the yard is specifically addressed in the lease sadly out of luck. hmm that unfortunate. it does seem strange to me though that by the same logic they could reduce my side of the backyard arbitrarily and give me say 10 square feet and it would be ok. it does have a door but their section of yard was fenced off from mine i doubt you have any leverage in this situation. it might be different if the landlord owned two adjacent single family residences and changed the fences to include both yards for only one house. but in this case you are in a duplex that previously had an unusual distribution of the two yards. if if in your lease or at least clearly part of what you are renting like the whole yard of a single family residence the landlord can almost certainly change the fence as they see fit. so the other unit have a door that exits out into the yard
