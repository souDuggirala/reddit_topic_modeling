we both live in ontario canada so while i was over visiting my father today he mentioned that his fiancee is going to be filing for unemployment but because they live together the employment office will count his wages into the equation when deciding her pay. what my father wants to do is set his living address as if he lives with me and "rent" their place to her for the duration of her unemployment so that she get the maximum allowed payout. i would like to know the legal repercussions to either me or my father if this did occur so i more easily and assertively decline his proposition. thanks this is fraud. the legal repercussions are potential criminal charges being sued civilly and your father getting significant penalties from ei as for the reason he giving you its 100% bullshit. his spouse income is irrelevant when it comes to ei benefit payments which are calculate purly as a percentage of his prior wages. the word you are looking for is criminal fraud specifically section 380 of the criminal code of canada. you need a reason not to commit fraud but in case you do imagine for a second if things go south between them and his gf ever wants to fry his cohones one anonymous tip to cra and he crispy. you with him. two questions. will he be living with you will he be claiming that rent from her on his taxes if the answer to either of those are "no" then you are dealing with unemployment fraud.
