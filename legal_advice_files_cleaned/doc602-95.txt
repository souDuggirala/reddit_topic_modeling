my lease ends in the beginning of january but i did not submit the renewal form to give he required days notice of termination. now they said we will have to pay for an additional month at a premium price. my roommate and i are both students and need to move out of town after this lease is over. there is no way either of us can afford to pay for two apartments during the month of january. is there any way for us to get out of this extra month of rent? if your lease allows you to sublease i suppose you could but then you would be on the hook for an entire year of rent not just one month. and if the people you subbed to damaged the apartment you would be responsible. what if we renewed our lease but had two other people take it over after we move out is that something that is possible? probably not. this is what you agreed to in your lease and your landlord has every right to expect it. if you get sued and lose it will be a matter of public record that you pay what you agreed to pay.
