i'm not sure if the flare is correct but i worked at a jersey mike in florida that had a cash tip pool that was distributed to employees based on hours with our paychecks. i make . an hour without tips so $. over minimum wage in florida. i missed my last two shifts that i worked there because i needed to take care of some things back home during my transition from one college to another. keep in mind this jersey mike is not run well so they had people on payroll that could close and one took the weekend off. so because i missed those shifts the manager was very upset with me and decided she going to give me my share of tips. when i confronted her about this she said the store owner told her she could do this. is this true or can i fight them on it and get the tips i believe i am owed? i took care of it by contacting corporate. i actually missed the days because of orientation for my new job and it a heck of a lot better than working for those sleeze balls! i know about your state but in nv seen it happen a handful of times. as long as you get minimum wage that all that matters. it totally a punk move by them. heck just file a wage claim against your employer with your state department of labor. if there any merit need to go through them anyway. and start looking for a new job. im sorry i meant that i did not receive tips for any of the time i worked. i expect tips for the time i missed but i received in tips for my hours on my paycheck. am i misunderstanding this that you feel you should get tips for missing work?
