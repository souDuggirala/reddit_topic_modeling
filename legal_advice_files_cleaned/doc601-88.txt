so to start off i have no contact to my ll directly only through a dodgy agency. i pay bills weekly and within my bills i pay for wifi. days ago the landlord without any prior warning turned off the broadband. the following day i called my agency and they apparently tly contacted the ll who said that he would get right on it. after a week and a half of me trying to get the agency to sort it out the met with him days ago who said he would get right on it again. following this i contact the agency to make sure and he apparently then called the broadband company days after so a week ago . they said it would be days for the package to arrive but despite this no wifi has been installed and i am still without. furthermore i have still have had to pay full bills each week. the only compensation he has offered is a £ reduction to this weeks bill only. i have had to spend £ on extra data and have nearly missed work opportunities from a client and some personal things like game tournaments i am a part of . is there something i can do? he clearly lied the first time and even with the fact that the wifi might arrive tomorrow i still have had weeks of paying for no wifi. tl:dr been paying for wifi for weeks and actually had wifi. ll has offered basically no compensation. what can i do?
