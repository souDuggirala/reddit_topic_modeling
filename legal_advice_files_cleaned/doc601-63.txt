hello about . years ago i had an accident in south fl at home. i sliced my achillesâ€™ tendon with the landlords gate. i want to pursue legal action. but i am currently living hours away. would it be better to have a lawyer who lives close to me work on the case or one that lives near where i had the accident? which would be more beneficial? thanks. depends on what your time is worth to you. if your damages rise to the level of having to sue in civil court you should get a lawyer. email and telephone calls are probably going to be some of your primary methods of communication either way so would it be worth my time to travel down south myself on my own time in order to sue travel time is often going to be billed to you as part of your agreement. perhaps not at their full hourly rate but it can definitely add up with such a long commute
