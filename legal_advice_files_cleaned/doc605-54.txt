hello i was reading the orc link here to section in question and the obscenity clause seems to apply to all pornographic content. am i reading this wrong or is all porn considered obscene in ohio if it really is obscene does this mean that anybody who posts a nude photo who lives in ohio can be prosecuted due to the pandering obscenity section of the orc could the viewer also be prosecuted i'm wondering this because i have friends who are camgirls and it seems like that could be illegal related: 2907.35v1 of the orc edit: also how does the federal definition of obscenity as defined in miller v california interact with this posting rule 5. it would be ok in this sub if you got into a situation regarding the obscenity law. if you are just curious it goes to off topic. i think that it follows the rules of this sub as it relates to a legal concept and there is a specific question being asked that relates to a real situation so i see why it should be in off topic. rule 5.
