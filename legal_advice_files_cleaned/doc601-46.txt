long story short i have been stalked by these people for a few years now and i have finally decided to move states however i have it on good authority that they figured out where i have moved and i fear the stalking will begin again soon. this would be terrible for anyone in my new town. i know the names of the people stalking me but thats about it. i have not much proof to show law enforcement. what would someone do in this case. well legally that all you can do. i'm not trying to say you are delusional just that you have to understand that how it sounds. good luck but regardless of if "nothing happened before" you are in a different location if it continues you need to file a police report. you can either do nothing or involve the police and obviously doing nothing helped you either. if you know who they are file a police report. but you may also want to consult with a therapist your story sounds fairly wild and people are going to question your mental health. it would be better to adress the mental aspects first and that way when you are questioned you can show that is not the issue ok. if being harassed you make a police report. if you believe being followed observed continuously you may wish to consult a physician. just to clarify you think 3 people have been following you across 30 states and how have you found that out stalked by people in what way what are they doing
