hello in mid august i ticketed for "running a stop sign" however there was no stop sign it was a yield. i went to court today and showed pictures of the road sign and they dismissed my ticket as long as i get another ticket for another days. the thing is i got a speeding ticket in a about a week ago in a different court i sent out a plea of not guilty the other week but would this ticket affect this probation since it was prior to this conviction? does the days start from my offense or from my court date? thanks i am in ny by the way.
