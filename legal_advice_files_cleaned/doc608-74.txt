h.o.a. fees are a little over $200. they have shut our water off at least twice a month for over a year. we have had constant issues with the upkeep of the complex. we had a massive leak in our condo that they had to pay to fix as it was their neglect that caused the problem. our roof is riddled with patches and i know there has been at least two other apartments in our building that have had bad leaks also. this morning i received an email saying the water would be shut off nothing unusual . but now i got a second email saying the water is off and they detect the leak in the rain and to prepare for the worst as they know when it will be turned back on. i'm tired of our management companies neglect and was wondering if there was anything i could do. thanks in advance to anyone who cares to help. that a good idea that i thought of. we own our condo so we trying to move just get things fixed. thanks for the advice contact your local code enforcement office as file a complaint. if a violation is found the code enforcement officer could take any or all of the following actions: 1. require repair and reinspection in x number of days depending on the laws in your location if the repairs are not completed further action by code enforcement will be taken 2. cite fine the property owner 3. declare your unit and others affected uninhabitable thereby terminating your lease allowing you to move out immediately without liability. yeah i wanted to when we first moved in but i work two jobs and meetings are during my second shift. run for a spot on the board
