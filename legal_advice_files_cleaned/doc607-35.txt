is it legal for political agencies too call people advertising candidates and asking if you will be voting for them this is one georgia and in the past few days had multiple calls from places advertising and asking if i planned on voting for political candidates they have been by actual people and not robo calls is this legal and if not were does it saw it not so when i get a call i can tell them it illegal and quote where it stated thanks ok that what i was expecting kinda sad though most of the time i just take up their time by saying ok after every question i do this with scam callers too sometimes you can get them on for a while sometimes they catch on quick legal and very very common. you can just hang up you have to answer them.
