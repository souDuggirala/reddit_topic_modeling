my stepdad of 24 years died in july. his widow my mother gave me a 1985 gmc truck that belonged to him. she never signed the title and the truck was registered in her name. i got it inspected and tagged and put insurance and such on it. then began working on it. spent over 4200$ in parts and labor had a shop done the work . my mother and me had a clash and she told me to give her the truck. well i had the title. keys. and truck. she tried to file unauthorized use of motor vehicle texas has no gta law . twice. well i was safe due to title and such. i went and tried to talk to the title office today and found out she found a way to get it in her name on 21st. i dont know how or what to do. it was my dads few and favorite possession and i didnt get anything else cept that truck so i dont want to give it up. if you have any thoughts let me know. making up with mother is an absolute no go as well. wont work trust me truck was in my dads name only sorry sheit sounds like you might want to talk to her and pretty much tell her not to be a dick. find out what process she used to claim the truck. she likely perjured herself while doing so because i suspect it required her to state that she had no way of contacting you. if she did perjure herself then the new title should be invalidated. she never signed the title and the truck was registered in her name. i'm a little confused about this part. it already hidden. but if she files again. end up with the charge now as it technically stolen
