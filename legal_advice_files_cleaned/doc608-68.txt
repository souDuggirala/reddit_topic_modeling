three weeks ago my roommate and i wanted to renew our leases individual leases for our apartment. i emailed my complex asking to renew my lease for next year. they replied telling me to call them to verbally request it. i told this to my roommate so he just called and email them he was told the cost of rent and that they will send him the lease. i called right after he finished. on the phone they told me the price of the rent for the following year and that i was all set i asked if there was anything else to do and they told me they will send me the lease. #x200b; my roommate got a call from them a few days ago telling him to sign it and so he did and he got the price that we were both told at the same time. i know he had already received his lease so i kept waiting until he told me yesterday he already signed it. i called today asking them what happened and they say they have no proof of me asking for the renewal and that the rates have already gone up $15 a month. #x200b; is there anything i can do to get the rate that i was told from the beginning since they are the ones that messed up by not sending me the lease when i first asked for it. i have proof of the email i first sent and the time of my call just 2 hours after they replied to my email. then that the new rent. what they told you verbally earlier likely matter; what you sign and agree to is what matters. free to negotiate with them. free to refuse to negotiate. they just sent it to me now but it shows the $15 increase so i havent signed it. did you or did you not sign a new lease what is the amount of monthly rent specified in that new lease
