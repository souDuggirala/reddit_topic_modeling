i live in alberta canada and my mother in law got her a boyfriend a credit card for his business which according to my wife was never registered and he got paid under the table for all the work. he used this credit card for materials for his renovation business and never paid it off and it now sitting at $12 000. after he quit doing the jobs he just sat at home for 2 years not making a dime and he finally got himself a job but is barely giving my mother in law anything to pay it off and we think he getting ready to bail on her. what i wanna know is what can she do if he does bail or is there anything she can do before hand to protect herself i would add to the other replies that if your mil and her bf were adult interdependent partners like common law but for alberta rules she may be able to use his behaviour to make a partner support claim. more generally she may be able to make an unjust enrichment claim. or in layman terms she can sue him. she may wish to speak with a lawyer about both options. they necessarily that starightforward. sure he could voluntarily assume the entire debt. but unless a court orders him to it highly unlikely he would. the credit card company also may not agree to that if he cannot qualify for the entire debt on his own. there no way to sign it over if even be willing to do that she can sue him. if the debt is in her name then the debt is in her name. it is her responsibility to pay it. she can sue him in small claims court if he racket up the debt in her name but if he has no money a judgment against him will do her no good.
