does one need to disclose tickets violations given outside the us eg in france while on vacation if applying to a us law school iaal not your lawyer i 100% would disclose. in my jurisdiction when you complete the c f application for the bar you have to disclose all criminal history worldwide and they can cross check your bar c f with the c f you submitted as part of your law school application. i think the ticket will impede your ability to get into law school or practice but lying even by omission might. good luck with your apps! what is the c f question you would be answering marijuana possession more info needed. what is the exact question referring to on the c f disclosure is it asking for speeding tickets volunteering information that is not relevant helpful. really the cf questions on a law school application serve to give a baseline to your truthfulness and serves as a quick way to tell if you should even consider law school. someone with an extensive criminal history is unlikely to be admitted to the bar regardless of completed law school. thanks! i would. likely be an issue but if caught lying it definitely will be.
