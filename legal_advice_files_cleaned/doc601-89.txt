hi all! i was hoping someone could walk me through the child support process or provide some good resources for when the primary care provider is stationed in georgia. the father is stationed in another state we were never married and does not want anything to do with the baby due in march so i will be providing 100% of the expenses for her. i am one pay grade higher than he is but overall he makes more when bah and spec pay come into play if they count when figuring child support . any assistance is greatly appreciated! call the legal offices of the nearest base and set up an appointment. i’m not at a normal base i’m at a geographically separated unit so we have a family readiness center legal office etc. base legal could provide you with relevant advice. here is the georgia child support calculator . it will give you a rough estimate about how child support is calculated in your state.
