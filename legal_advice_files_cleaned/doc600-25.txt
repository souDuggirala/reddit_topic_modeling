my co worker is not a smart man. he young and naive and quite grasp how a lot of things work yet. most of the guys are mean to him so i try to at least be decent because i feel bad. anyways he wanted a new er car because his was falling apart so he found one locally to buy for . i told him initially it a bad idea because the seller had jumper cables in the passenger seat in the photos but what do i know? so he buys this car in cash. no writing. no signed papers. he pays the money and the seller hands the keys over. he even think anything of it until i asked him about the expired license plate. he aware he needed a new one or that he would have to pay additional fees to have it done as he saved up just enough to pay for the car and that it. i also informed him that all the seller has to do is report the car as stolen and he has no way to defend himself and his money is still gone. naturally the seller has gone radio silent. what are his options here if any? added. thanks. frankly if he contact the seller and has no documentation he can try filing for a missing title with the state. however that will be entirely dependent on the state he in as different states will have different requirements regarding proof of ownership. additionally this will likely not be a cheap matter and he absolutely should not drive that vehicle with no proof of ownership and the expired plates. frankly there also a good chance he got scammed and is out . it would be an expensive life lesson learned. location is required.
