 hi all. hope this is the right place i just know where to go for advice info until i get to the mva. i posted in so see if that gets any feedback. \ \ i live in maryland\ \ so on december 30th 2017 i traded in my old vehicle for a newer one. have proof of new insurance still sitting in my email. today 11 months later exactly my dad called me saying he received a letter from the dmv regarding a $600 fine for "a lapse in insurance" on the vehicle i traded in. he cosigned on that vehicle since it was my first one at 18 with no credit so the letter was sent to his address. now i had to turn the tags in myself not the dealership. i was a little delayed in doing so about a month but i got it done. i will need to go visit my local mva to see if they can pull up the exact date any proof of this turn in because i unfortunately have a receipt. i dropped them my registration into their tag drop box at the branch. this is where i'm scared and feel this will screw me i have proof of my new insurance and when i started it and since it friday and i get out of work until they close i will be going to the mva on monday to try and see if they can pull up proof of turning in my tags. is there anything else i can do to dispute this do i need anything else maryland is a pain in the ass when it comes to tags registration and penalties and i really would rather not have to pay a $600 fine for an insurance lapse on tags i stopped using almost a year ago and turned in. they sent one letter warning me about late fees before i returned them but after returning them i receive a single letter from them about this until today
