hi so a year and a half ago i was charged with alleged assault. the case went on for almost four months. i was damaged mentally because the reality of it was that i was assaulted and when i threw my attacker off me they told others that i threw them. they were choking me and i threw them off over my back. they had already marked me with scratches and bites. i was bleeding and my blood got on them. the person who reported it saw my blood on them and thought it was theirs. the case cost my $7000 and after being warned that any contact with the “assaulted” would be a fine and or imprisonment mentally i was a wreck and would get panic attacks any time i so much as even heard sirens. i even watch tv shows with prison content in it because i kept seeing myself there. a month later i lost a parent. i get a chance to recover from one tragedy before entering the next. which is why only now have i begun to wonder if there something i can do about the alleged assault case since the charges were dropped. if i need to provide any more clarification or information for this please let me know. thank you
