i had some confusion with a college class and apparently i did have to pay contrary to what i understood that part matter really . point is i want to pay the whole amount off. it a little under $200 so not much. i can afford to pay it right now easily. i live in wisconsin and heard that they give me my tax refund if i owe money. i know if this is true but i would like to just pay the amount off all at once if it possible instead of them taking 13% until it paid off. where can i go to pay it off. i think it too late to pay my college so can i just pay the wisconsin department of revenue in full directly somehow i went to the school and paid. hopefully that clears it all up. i have a receipt to dispute any garnished wages from here on out. you should be able to pay them directly but almost certainly need to talk to someone there to make sure you do it right. there likely specific paperwork need to fill out. so call my school the ones that told me what was going on. i had no clue anything was happening until they told me today. they know much only that they got a letter from the wisconsin department of revenue and the amount they need to take from my paychecks. i appears so from what i found out from my employer. is the wisconsin department of revenue the one who is handling the debt you might ask your employer if they can provide you the details of the garnishment. you want to call the original debtor to see who owns the debt now if not them.
