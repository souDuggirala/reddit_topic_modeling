i caught someone keying my new car with photographic evidence. the damages are over $2 000 in damage. this is surely unethical but is it legal to have them pay me under the table for the damages then report them and have them cover the damage again 2 wrongs make a right but if you insist on being an idiot and blatantly attempting both extortion and insurance fraud be surprised when you get caught and have to deal with the consequences. having someone pay you cash to repair damages they have caused you “under the table”. threatening to report them to the police if they do so is extortion. having them pay you and then making a claim against their insurance is insurance fraud in its stupidest form. so you want to both extort someone and commit insurance fraud how many years are you looking to spend in prison i can promise you there much quicker and easier ways to do that. exactly gotcha no evidence. i’m just curious since i know how insurance fraud works that well. if i technically get the person to pay me under the table how would it be insurance fraud and is paying under the table even legal ok thanks! no that would be perjury. you are only entitled to the necessary money to make you whole unless a judge approves penalties and or statutory damages. representing you been made whole when you have to a court is the very definition of perjury. #x200b; yeah i am and i admit it ethically wrong but so is breaking the law with vandalism so no foul play. or say the wrong thing and get yourself caught up in insurance fraud. it was worth a shot. but if it work then it work. what makes you think you could get paid a second time the person will surely tell their insurance company that you were already paid.
