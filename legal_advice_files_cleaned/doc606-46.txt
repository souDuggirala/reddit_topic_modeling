back in 2017 i got a series of moving violations while working a job as a sprinter van driver. the total points from these would put me well over the amount that could get my license suspended but i have plead not guilty and then pushed the court dates back on all of them and they are now all over a year and a half old. i have since moved to pennsylvania and have not gotten any other moving violations. my questions are: is it still possible that a traffic judge will suspend my license in new york even though the offenses occurred over a year and a half ago and if a your license is suspended in new york is it also suspended in pennsylvania i spoke to a pa traffic attorney who said that the points 'can' transfer to pa from ny or nj but usually . yes the judge can. and otherwise listen to the attorney.
