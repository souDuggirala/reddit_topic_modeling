i just moved in to a new property this weekend. as directed by an associate of the management company i dropped off my security deposit and first months rent into their secured drop box at their office. this was last night 12 3 and the box even has a sign that says it has surveillance. it was a total of $2190 in the form of a money order. they specified that it be “in secured funds which would be a money order or cashier check”. they notified me today that their drop box was broken into and were curious if my deposit was in there. i told them it was and that i had my money order receipts. the money orders were from fifth third and informed me that i will need to wait some time before action can be taken. it sounds like in 60 day if it is not cashed i can have it refunded. if it does get cashed need to go through another process. my question is what do i need to do or how should i approach this to protect myself the management company specified if need to pay them again but i want to be prepared when i inquire on the matter further. the management company might try to put this loss on you. remember it was stolen from their box your responsibilities towards it ended once you gave it to them as directed. thank you very much! this is helpful advice. asked for more details on the theft and asked about a police report. hopefully the can provide me with details in time to work things out at the bank. i would recommend you have the management company check their security footage start a police report and get the report details. once you get that call the bank back and explain you have a police report and see if there is any way a manager can escalate expedite things. i would also ask the bank if they could put a stop pay on it if its not already too late this may have a fee but could save you a lot of time. best of luck!
