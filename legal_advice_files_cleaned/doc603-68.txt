i have points on dl in florida. work in the hvac business and my boss is giving me a work van. but iâ€™m worried the points will raise the insurance rates to the point he want to give me it. lawyer i talked to says it will cost for a chance to get them removed. points usually matter to commercial policies. he already pay rates high enough to cover any idiot he allows to drive.
