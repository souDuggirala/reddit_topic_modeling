 previous thread tl:dr: surrendered the firearm over to local pd then got it registered under my name. _ new york state _ long story: searching for an answer with the advise from the previous thread i contacted the local bar association for a referal to an estate attorney. a very nice local attorney advised me his fees would be costly in research alone and that i should “shop around” a little more. looking around more i got the same answer and was directed to the same piece of law that i linked to in the previous post. i even tried a couple gun rights focused attorneys with out much luck. the solution that worked in the end feeling i had exausted my options and not wanting to commit a felony in ny i called and surrendered the firearm to local pd and made a quick statement. the attending officer even said he works with these types of situations all the time. i was provided a receipt and used that to file the necessary paperwork. now a month later i have a what i can only describe as a priceless family heirloom in my legal possession. obligatory disclaimer: this is only a one off situation that cannot be taken as legal precedent or advice from a lawyer. this is only my personal experience if you find yourself in a similar situation i would still recommend contacting your lawyer.
