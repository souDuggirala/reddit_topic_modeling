my mother passed away last month and lived in south carolina. my sister lives near her but we on good terms and speak her daughter texted a cousin which is how i know . i know i was in the will but know for how much and the executor was an attorney but i know who he she is. can anyone tell me the timeline the attorney executor has for notifying those who are in the will and the details no knowledge of south carolina laws in this area specifically but there typically is only a deadline by which things have to be filed not a required timeline in terms of how quickly things have to be handled. do you know the county in which your mother lived until she passed that the county in which the will would have to be filed in order to open the estate and begin the process of handling things. call the clerk office in that county to determine how you can find out if the will been filed. that should also allow you to determine what lawyer is handling the estate. if a beneficiary you should be able to get information directly from that lawyer. note that this is typically not a quick process; the estate has to stay open for long enough for creditors to make claims etc. once you find the lawyer be able to advise you as to expected timeframe.
