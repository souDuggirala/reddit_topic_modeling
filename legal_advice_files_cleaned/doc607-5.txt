so i edited a text message in messenger and sent it to someone else in order for them to fight with words but in the end the girl i sent it to said "i will tell my uncle who is a cop to make a complaint to police" but she doesnt know its edited.is there a chance for me to get arrested i live in greece if that helps thanks for helping. to explain it better i edited the message that the first one is badmouthing the other and sent it to the other with fake account do i dont get revealed. but the girl i sent it to doesnt know its edited. umm i changed the words of the first saying that not serious bad words to the other one. i get what your saying what exactly did you do i edited a message via html when u press right click on a message and press check option what do you mean u edited a message i understand my mistake and i wont do it again but i want to know if its illegal oe not quit doing dumb stuff on the internet and move on with your life.
