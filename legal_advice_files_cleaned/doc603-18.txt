about 3 months ago i was detained and willing signed up for the confidential informant program through my college police station. the warrant they had was for selling a schedule ii substance within close range of a child care center. im only 19 and was a use at the time i signed up for the program without speaking to a lawyer and still . the anxiety is beginning to severely affect my life and i’m worried i’m being taken advantage of despite being compliant. if anyone has any good information on the process of being a ci and how long it lasts would be greatly appreciated. if this violates any rules or my obligations to the program please lmk so i can remove the post. i’m just scared and see an end to this at the time. thanks. lmfao fuck me right cough snitch cough lmao you need to talk to a lawyer and show him her everything you signed with the cops. they had a search warrant that they used to search my apartment but i did not have any drugs on me at the time that related to my arrest warrant xanax . thanks. i was never read my rights and was discouraged by officers to get a lawyer because i would look like i’m not complying. ianal. it sounds like you were probably selling adderall or similar on campus. does your school have a legal clinic i think you really need to talk to a lawyer. good luck. the police can keep you as a ci for hypothetically as long as they want subject to whatever deals agreements are in place. you really need a lawyer to review the deal agreement or to get one in place and advise you on how to move forward.
