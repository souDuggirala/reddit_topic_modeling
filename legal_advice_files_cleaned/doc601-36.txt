so our lease really says nothing about this. i am supposed to be there until october 4th 2019. i cannot take certain neighbors and the god awful management. the apartment room itself is amazing. i gave 60 days written notice. two questions: 1 can i revoke that at any time my gf went in earlier to pay the rent and office manager lady made a comment how she already found people to take over our room in a smartads way. she just that type of person. 2 will i still owe rent until lease expires she emailed and said if i give notice in november which i did i owe rent for dec. and jan. if management her terminated it. well i emailed her and basically asked if we were still mutually terminating it and she decides to say “no management terminate the lease. you gave your 60 days notice.” she refuses to answer my question about if we still owe last the 60 days since “management terminate it” now. she was totally mutual about terminating it and us wanting to leave. now it like she trapped us just to be clear your lease says nothing about fees or any process for leaving your lease early 1. generally after you give notice you revoke it. the landlord is using that information to begin finding other tenants so they may be out expenses in trying to find a new tenant. a new tenant may also be out because expecting your unit to be open and now it . 2. that is entirely dependent on your lease and your location. some states require the landlord to mitigate their damages and find a new tenant as soon as possible. in general still on the hook for rent until the unit has been re rented to prevent double dipping by the landlord but again this is dependent on your lease language and your location.
