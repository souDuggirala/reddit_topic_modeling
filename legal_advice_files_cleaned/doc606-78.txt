my british friend was picked up by ice because his wife of 6 months wants all he has even his clothes. he is a great guy who deserve this. she pulled his natrulatizaton papers his visa was expired and she called so it would be easier for her to claim his money and things. he has considerable money. he is at fault for not renewing his visa but this is coldhearted. immigration says that he might be able to bond out. my question is what can we do to help him protect his property and get him out of detention he was detained in northern mississippi and is currently being held in louisiana. thank you. i can give additional details if needed. on the flip side with a good attorney he can file for a green card under vawa as manipulating immigration benefits like that has been considered abuse and even though the w stands for women the law covers and foreign spouse who is the victim of abuse at the hands of a us spouse. honestly know past the basics immigration law is outside of my lane. the reason ice was contacted is irrelevant. you can report somebody for overstaying their visa out of spite. he needs an immigration attorney. this is his fault for overstaying his visa. he has an immigration attorney. what are the odds of him being bonded out you can get him an immigration attorney and a divorce lawyer. for a 6 month marriage she is unlikely to get much of anything with the exception of him getting banned from visiting the us for 10 years. you can get him an immigration attorney
