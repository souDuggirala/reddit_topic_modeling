i was in a minor accident 12 11 2017. i went to court and got it dismissed. i even have to go inside the court room the cop walked out told me it had been dismissed and i got my money back. i have progressive auto. i got stuck paying the surcharge for that term. i spoke to a rep a few months ago who said come next policy the surcharge would be gone. new policy has started and i still have the surcharge. progressive refuses to pull my record stating they only do it every 12 18 months. the interesting thing is that the last time progressive pulled my record was 5 2018. this leads me to believe that they never actually dismissed the ticket. what do i do i'm really poor and $40 to check my record online is too much. progressive refuses to pull my record stating they only do it every 12 18 months. time to fire your insurance carrier. regardless of whether or not the ticket was dismissed the fact that there was an accident will continue to haunt your driving record and insurers will charge more. i was in a minor accident 12 11 2017. were you partly at fault the cop walked out told me it had been dismissed and i got my money back. what money why did you pay money before the ticket was adjudicated and what was the ticket for this leads me to believe that they never actually dismissed the ticket. call the court and ask what the disposition of the ticket was.
