in pennsylvania a friend of mine really! was arrested on this charge after they found a lot in the back of his truck 0ver 80 lbs . this might sound a silly question as it a felony but how serious is this do mandatory minimum sentences exist and will a plea deal likely get it down that one way to put it i think he been very very silly at that point it might become a federal crime he paying for a good lawyer. he definitely crossed state lines he live in the state he was caught in and was on the highway. that going to be difficult to determine. by itself this charge has a maximum fine of $15 000 and a maximum sentence of 5 years for a first offense. then it gets complicated. there are other charges that can be brought in conjunction with possession with intent to deliver. possession of paraphernalia can carry an even higher fine and longer sentence. then there the school zone mandatory minimum sentencing and in pennsylvania that not as easy as simply looking to see if there is an actual school nearby. it can be added on any time the offense took place within the prescribed limits of any property owned by a school any type of school. if they can prove that he crossed state lines in order to bring the pot into pennsylvania then you have additional felony charges there as well. your friend needs a good lawyer asap. thanks i think he has much of a history but he been incredibly stupid. these are all great questions for your friend to ask their lawyer. 80 pounds is a lot. it looks like it could be up to 15 year depends on priors and how much he can spend on a lawyer really.
