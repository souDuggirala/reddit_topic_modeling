 been working on creating a podcast as a hobby during my downtime. like to use a different poem or a small piece of literature in the beginning of each episode. would i be able to use that material as long as i reference the author would it be legal this may be a dumb question but i'm learning that copyright can be very complex and i want to get in trouble in the future.
