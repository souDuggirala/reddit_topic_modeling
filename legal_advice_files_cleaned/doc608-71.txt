as the title states a friend of mine was in a small accident involving one other vehicle. the lady he hit took a picture of his insurance and drivers license with his consent . no police report was ever filed about the incident. now this person is in contact with his insurance company wanting money for the accident. my advice to him was to deny deny deny due to the lack of police report proving an accident ever took place. should he contact an attorney regarding the matter wait for action to be taken against him just looking to give him some half decent advice. no he should not lie saying no accident happened. that will come back to bite him i a very bad way. he should be honest
