hi everyone i'm hoping this will be quick. it mostly a sanity check. i'm a software consultant that works for a firm. finished my first assignment and now they are consulting me out to a different company. the problem is that this company is a benefits provider and my partner current has a legal case open against them for wrongful termination of benefits. i feel like this is a conflict of interest and i need to disclose this to my employer before they consult me out. am i worried over nothing it super unlikely be working with confidential data but none the less i want to be sure.
