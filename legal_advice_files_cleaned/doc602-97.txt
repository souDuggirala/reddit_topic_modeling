the store i work pt at offered employees overtime for anyone who wants to work thanksgiving. i have a screenshot of the owner making this offer. fast forward to today pay day after thanksgiving and what do you know no one who worked thanksgiving got overtime for it! i contacted the gm about it. he made a joke about waiting until next thanksgiving then said check on it. this was about an hour ago and i heard back. so my question is at what point is this considered wage theft if he says " get it to you on your next check" is that acceptable is it already wage theft because it given to us when it was guaranteed to be what should i do here that what my current plan is. i'm going in this morning see how things go. texas require premium pay on any holidays at all but does require employers to follow their written policies. since you have proof of them telling you be paid at time and a half not completely sol. not required to cut a check out of cycle. if it not on your next check file a wage complaint with twc. so what do i need would it just be small claims court edit: this affected more than just me it was all the employees who worked that day. you need a lawyer unless the missing wages are more than $10k ok cool. thank you! if it not on the next check be contacting a lawyer. so you should ask for it and see if they will include it in your next pay check. it unrealistic to expect that they will process an out of cycle payroll just for that. your recourse would be a wage claim or a lawsuit. but i have a screenshot of the owner guaranteeing us ot for thanksgiving. expect them to cut you an out of cycle payroll check for overtime they were not required to pay you. if the answer is next pay check that is the best you can hope for. if they say they pay you can try filing a wage claim but it might not work because this required by any law to be paid to you.
