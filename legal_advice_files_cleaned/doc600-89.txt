the twins did not patent their idea it was just a rough sketch they shared with mark. if mark anything with facebook. they would have just dropped it they never visioned it as much as zuck did . but mark ended up paying the twins. so is it like my friends can come and claim that they said the idea to me and start a lawsuit that why patents were invented for such mistakes. what advantages did the twins have .
