warranty covers half of the price so i paid half mechanic told me everything is going to be solved. car lasted 2 months and mechanic asked me to pay more money because he did what he was supposed to do but problem solved. what should be my next approach be should i call the warranty that they do properly their job or i have no other option but to pay more. thanks was the car in the shop for 2 months or did they 'fix' it give it back to you and now it having more problems if the timing chain needed repair and if now there is something not the timing chain in need of repair need to pay for the next repair. if the first repair took 2 months you might consider a different mechanic this time. mechanic told me that it needs timing chain replacement after two months of waiting he told me that he needs $1400 because there some tooth missing but at the beginning of perform he told me that everything is going to be solved. thing here is he kept the car 2 months even though i kept asking him what is up with the car he always entertained me. after 2 months he told me not everything was solved going to have to try harder at explaining this problem. you had a mechanic perform repairs and 2 months later the problem has recurred that in and of itself is not evidence that anyone do their job properly. often in repairs the mechanic replaces a part or system in need of replacement which then turns out not to solve the underlying concern. unless the mechanic was incompetent in his diagnosis or performance of the repair this is just the nature of automotive repair. you move on to the next most probable part or system to replace. if there is some evidence that the mechanic performed the original repair incorrectly or knowingly or incompetently performed an unnecessary repair there may be something to talk about. though that is generally quite difficult to prove.
