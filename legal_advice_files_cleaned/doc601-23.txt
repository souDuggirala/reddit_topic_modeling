hello all obligatory sorry for formatting on mobile i am in need of some advice here. i am a physician assistant in the state of pennsylvania. i am due to start a new job next week. today i received an email from the office manager informing me that they will be withholding 3 days pay from my first paycheck. this will be withheld until i separate from the practice and will only be returned to me if time accrued time taken i'm assuming this is in reference to pto is balanced. i have never encounter this before in any other job that held and am questioning the legality of it. i tried looking up wage withholding in pa employment law but it seems kind of vague. what i understand is that employers withhold pay unless it benefits the employee in some way or if the employee has agreed to it so please correct me if i'm wrong. there was no mention of this withholding in my contract and this is the first that i am hearing of it. any help or advice would be much appreciated.
