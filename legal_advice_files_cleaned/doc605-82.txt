soooo i was served papers to be summoned by a loan place i borrowed money from a while ago. court date is tomorrow afternoon and now choosen the great time of freaking out about it as i nearly done nothing to really prep for this. well not exactly nothing i already spoke to collection agency of said debtor signed an agreement to make a payment towards the debt which i already started on. but now second guessing on if there a gotcha surprise that could catch me as i go to court like "ah ha pay us moar monies" or if since i made this arrangement if i need to even show up which i still may take the trouble to go to anyways just to be safe . just hoping this is a straight forward process that puts them at bay also semi worried if this or said agreement i mindlessly signed to started paying on will clog up things if i ever decide to consolidate this with my other debts.
