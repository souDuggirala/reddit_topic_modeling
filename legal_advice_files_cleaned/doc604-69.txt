hello all i'm living in va. the company i'm with is not from the states. my pay is fair but after i reach the 40h each week my overtime pay is just straight time. after checking online i found out it is supposed to be time and a half. my question is: are there cases and where the federal law does not apply and if yes what are they also if i get paid the wrong rate what can i do thanks that it! appreciate your help : are you flsa exempt while the fact paid hourly would generally lead to a conclusion that you are not there are some hourly positions that can be exempt like some computer related occupations for example. there are a number of exceptions to the overtime pay rule. agriculture and movie theatres for example are exempt. another common one is specialized fields making more than $28 an hour. so depending on what you do there could be an excemption that applies. if there is no exemption and you being paid overtime file a wage claim with your department of labor.
