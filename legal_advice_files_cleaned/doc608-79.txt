short and simple. anyways we hired movers to help us move our stuff into pods and i have all my personal belongings in my suitcase. yesterday i had just decided to try pot for the first time from my friends wax cart moving is stressful . long story short i bought one from him and put it in my suitcase. i had work and just got home and noticed my cart in my suitcase in the spot i put it. i have checked all my clothes spots and luggage to make sure. in conclusion i'm very confident one of the movers insured took my wax cart while i was at work what do i do its medical down here in fl should i contact them what can i do is it possible that it legal to carry it for his mom so you want to know if you can report your illegal drugs stolen either to the police or to the insurance think about that was it legal for you to possess that
