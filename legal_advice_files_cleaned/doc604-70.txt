i am currently using my alt because i found a suitcase with 10k in it counted it yet but it in a wrapping that says $10 000 and ove checked 10 of the bills and all are real. i feel like i'm in a movie what do i do please post your home address. that will help in answering your question. side of the highway just saw a old beat up case and thought it would be good for a costume i'm gonna do and opened it and almost had a heart attack. none it all beat up. found it on the side of the highway. need to post your state on this one. however if you turn it into the police i suggest you first enlist the assistance of an attorney whom can help ensure you get the money if not claimed. an attorney will also know the local laws regarding obligation to turn it in. state though will help to determine if you are required to report this. was there any identifying information on the suitcase at all your username is how i feel! be a guy carrying around an air tank looking for you. not to mention if this money is for something shady and you keep it that may or may not implicate you this is just an assumption need a lawyer to confirm . call the police and turn it in. other than knowing you did the right thing you may very well get a reward. bring it to the nearest police station.
