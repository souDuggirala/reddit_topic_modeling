my previous post is here . the tl;dr: is that i owe medical debt from having my daughter and have been served with a summons for wage garnishment. i called the attorney office today and was told that i can probably avoid garnishment if i make a down payment and then set up a payment plan. the woman i spoke to told me to look at our finances and get back to her with an offer which she will put in writing for me. i'm trying to figure up what to offer. i want to verify that i have this correct. i get paid biweekly about $500. if they take 25% of that $125 i would end up paying $250 month. if they garnish based on the amount my disposable income exceeds 30 times minimum wage $7.25 per week =$31.50 if you literally just multiply 7.25 x 30 would i be paying $31.50 per week $63 per bi weekly paycheck for a total of $126 per month i'm going to definitely make an offer to the attorney to avoid garnishment. i want to make sure it an offer that will be accepted so like to at least offer the amount that would be garnished if not slightly more to pay it off sooner. my basic idea is that i can imply that i'm giving them more paying it off quicker than if they went through with the garnishment proceedings so it would be more beneficial to accept my offer. i hope this makes sense i will be happy to clarify if necessary!
