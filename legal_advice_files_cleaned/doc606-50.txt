before even filing for divorce she had the locks on the house changed. i the key back when i left because it still my house too. is what she didlegal and based on your narative she absolutly needed one. seriously got to stay away from her whilst that protection order is active. that also means not going to the house she is living in. thank you. generally yes. the protection order likely gives her that right and you do not live there so it is not like she is evicting you. i want a key. i want to go in the house. i want anything to do with her. iâ€™m asking if what she done is legal. it still my house and until she buys me out it not hers alone. i want to go in. i want to know if it legal that she be allowed to do it. also protection orders are one person saying something is so. no proof. no jury. no trial. they can be obtained easily. run this by your lawyer but if she already has an order of protection then in all likelihood not allowed at the house anyways and i know why going to create conflict demanding a key when already left. if she has a protection order why the hell would you want to go in sounds like she had a perfectly good reason to change the locks to keep you out. her safety. move along. i did move out but did not take my name off the deed. she has not bought me out of the hime either. she did get a protection order as a way to control the pace of things. do you still live there if so you may call a locksmith. she bar you from your own home. if you try to gain access regardless of your right to do so or not. it will probably anger the judge. have you already moved out
