hey there la! not a typical attention grabber but i am a young and pretty new sm of a retail store and i busted a druggie a couple months back for stealing a shirt from my store. this was the first time anyone busted has actually been reported to the police and prosecuted the other times caught people they were usually younger kids who gave the stuff back or others who just made off with it anyway and never caught . the guy in question was arrested about a week later on an unrelated charge that was also retail theft. never been in a courtroom before and have no idea what to expect or how the proceedings work. can anyone give me information as to anything from courtroom courtesy the kinds of questions they ask or what i should bring with me or use to prepare for the hearing i really appreciate everyone time and while i anticipate many responses anything helps. thank you! ok! i was pretty nervous about being interrogated was unsure if it was a grueling process or not. thank you!!! oh thank you! i did not realize that sub existed. thank you! been to court for probably 100 different stops over the years. never had to take the stand once. my area has mediation and pbjs. either way 99.99% chance you just have to show sit for a couple hours and they will tell you they settled. you might also ask in
