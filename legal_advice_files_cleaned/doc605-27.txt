 this a parental advice subreddit. frankly what other parents would do is wholly irrelevant. legally the answer hinges in large part on the country he in. be inclined to have paternity established and may consider pursuing child support in his country. child support means a higher degree of stability financial security etc. than would otherwise exist. i waive that just because the guy is frustrating to deal with. if you need the money fully fund the kid college education and open an utma account. he have any rights to the kid absent a court order or a signed acknowledgment of paternity birth certificate. this is not so expect that part to be answered here. the legal dimension: if not married and he sign the birth certificate you will have full custody and can make all decisions alone. you can allow him to visit but have no obligation to do so and can change your mind at any time. he have to pay child support. either of you can request a paternity test; he as a step to get visitation custody you as a step to get child support. at this point likely go to court to arrange a binding parenting plan and you should definitely get a lawyer to assist you there.
