not sure this is the right sub but i'm not a reddit expert. my mom died in march and i'm using her old car to commute to college. the registration ran out in july which i learned by getting pulled over whoops and my dad said register it. he however seem to he says he has to pay the car off beforehand so it can be in his name. is he right what can we do if he is right what can we do if he wrong thanks for any advice you can give. nop a lawyer. normally the car and the loan would be transferable via probate to the new owner who would then take over payments on the loan and have a new title and registration done without paying it off. it sounds like that done. depending on how much is left on the car a probate attorney might get it moved around way cheaper than paying it off. you should be able to get a cheap $50 $150 or free consult to see if it going to be possible and how much work would be involved.
