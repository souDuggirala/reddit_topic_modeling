 neither epic nor playstation are responsible for reimbursing you the money. this is solely on your kid. depends on where the playstation gift cards were purchased. if they were purchased directly from sony they may be able to do something. if they were purchased from an online or physical retailer i.e. not directly from sony then sony really have any skin in the game pun not intended and your issue would sit with the retailer. neither company owes you the money. if you wanted to report his actions to the police you could as any recourse you have would be against your son. you can try contacting sony and explaining the situation but they may not be willing to reverse the payments. they formally involved in a dispute between you and your minor child. grounding your son and taking his playstation away until he understands what was wrong about his actions might be appropriate as would withholding his allowance or having him work additional chores to make up the cost. he stole cash and my son is 11yo so i dont want to get him in trouble this may be able to help however since it a direct purchase from sony but were gift cards it may be different. if you chargeback the money with sony ban the account. i know about epicgames. this sounds more like a discipline your kid thing than a demand money back from a game company thing. edit: ianal but i do game on ps4 so i know about sony policies with chargebacks. make him work for the money with all royalties coming back to you and your husband. i assume he used your credit card and did so without your permission if so you may be able to charge back the purchases. your son may face some legal difficulties as a result particularly if he an adult; credit card fraud is a crime in every eu member country and will almost certainly lose both his epic account and his playstation network account as both companies have a policy of closing accounts with chargebacks.
