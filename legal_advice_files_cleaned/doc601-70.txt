im going to post this here but it may not be the right sub and it might be for for finical advice. my community association called me days ago and told me that i have a credit with them for a few grand. and that we have been over paying them they sent me a copy of the statement and it does show over payments when i compare that to my bank records i dont show that we are overpaying and there are payments that are not from my account showing up on the statement what should i do. i live in florida and the company already send us a check for the credit. ah. then talk to the association as it appears making significant accounting errors. i dont have a mortgage i purchased my house cash. have you checked to see whether your association payments are bundled with your mortgage?
