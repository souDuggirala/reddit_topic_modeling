two posts to give some perspective: =jp7jrc5f sh=1284b792 =jp8u9jfq sh=d233ff8e i know what questions to ask what my rights are as a mother or what to be careful of. what can i do to protect myself without causing a major family fallout get a lawyer. if he is preventing you from accessing money to pay for one a lawyer can work with the court to make him pay the costs. the two biggest things want to be careful of are an enforceable custody and child support arrangement which generally means a court order and an enforceable division of assets and spousal support agreement which generally means a court order. those orders can be stipulated agreements rather than the result of arguments and filings but until it comes from a judge at real risk your ex husband will back out or refuse to comply and that you will be left with very little to do but to go to court over it. get an attorney do this right and be prepared to go back to court to enforce anything he deviates from. the reason your ex husband wants to do this outside of the courts is so that he have to cooperate if he want to. it helps him and help you and _definitely_ help your kids. i think the advice given in the other threads is sound: do whatever it takes to get yourself a competent divorce attorney if you wish to seek a divorce then listen to that attorney.
