i live in california us. i work minimum wage job. i believe it is the law that we get 24 hours of paid sick time a year. i asked my manager if i could use those sick hours and she said i need a doctors note. do i need a doctors note if so can i just go to any doctor that can write me a note called in sick multiple times but never gotten any pay for it. and would like to! thanks for your time. where iâ€™m from if out 48 hours or call our two shifts in a row you are legally required to bring in a doctors note. but that could differ in states. as far as i know not supposed to require a doctor note for your mandatory time the 24 hours and should only do so once your legally mandated paid sick time is used up: they most likely paid you the first three times you called out sick. i believe you need a doctors note after being out sick for 3+ days.
