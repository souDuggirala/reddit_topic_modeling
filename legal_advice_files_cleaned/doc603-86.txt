i wrote a few bad reviews for a complex been having an issue with. i also left a few bad reviews yelp google etc . they were true and or opinion about my frustration with the office staff acting like this a issue they should have to deal with and being generally unresponsive. i requested for compensation for moving into a filthy apartment with graffiti and carpet stains. she emailed me saying "the apartment was clean and ready prior to your arrival." which was an obvious lie and had pictures to prove it. #x200b; i posted a review on facebook and attached pictures of the dirty unit and added a screenshot of her email stating the apartment was clean. i wanted to get my point across that she was clearly lying. she called me right away angry and was saying she was going to call her lawyer for posting a screenshot of the email with her name and picture. hahaha! i know she was trying to scare me but i going to let that stop me. well she can do what she wants i cant imagine what charges she would be suing you for it is not defamation unless its untrue i already am! my lawyer says we have a real case here only wants a 10 000 retainer and he will file right away ; u.s. i assume. freedom of speech it is not libel or slander people can sue for anything mean successful. i could sue you right now for posting this even.
