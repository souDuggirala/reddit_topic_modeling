i moved into a new apartment back in october and since moved in submitted 7 maintenance requests. all of these requests say they were completed but only one was actually ever addressed and completed. i’m a stay at home mom so it not unusual for me not to leave the house for several days at a time especially when i’m expecting maintenance to come by. i know i just missed maintenance because the problems i need them to fix are still there even after the status says completed. i submitted a request last week for them to come fix a leaky ceiling light and after 3 days of waiting the status was changed to “completed on date that i was definitely home all day”. i submitted another request after my ceiling light started leaking water again and noticed that 2 of my previous requests had been deleted. one for my dishwasher which is still broken and one about my porch light fixed the second time i submitted the request . is the complex doing something shady here i’m afraid some serious damage is going to happen especially from this leaking ceiling light! and have deleted my requests for maintenance and the cost will be on me. is there anything i can do to protect myself from something like that ive got screenshots of the requests that are currently on there but not of the 2 they deleted. have you tried speaking to the apartment manager
