a former employer will not stop calling me and keeps telling me to call them back. i replied back in email to say that i'm willing to help with whatever problem it may be if they would just email me the situation. i really just want to get on with my life and move on but it scares me that they put it in writing. they are saying it something regarding ip but i know what they are talking about. i'm not sure what to do because i have any money to get a lawyer. i'm worried that they will accuse me of something that never happened. what legal difference does it make either you did it or you do it and whether or not they can reach you to personally accuse you of it make a bit of legal difference one way or another. all communication is coming from one person. thank you for replying. i'm worried that they will accuse me of something that never happened. just answer the phone and talk to them. some people communicate through email. heck the person that calling you might not even be the person that getting those emails. you making it difficult to communicate with them by dictating what means of communication going to allow going to make them back off. nothing illegal here especially since you answering the phone to figure out what they want. either talk to them or block the number. realize that if you ignore their call and block the number it may negatively affect your ability to use them as a reference.
