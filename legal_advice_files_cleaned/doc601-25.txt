i was recently charged with disorderly conduct drunk night on mill ave lol . i was offered a diversion program which i have already started taking classes for. i was told i had to do classes and pay fees. my question is will the program be over once iâ€™m done with the classes? or will i have to keep checking in with the counselor for the remainder of the months they provide to get the classes done? this is really important as i have a background check coming up for a big accounting firm and i need to get the charges dismissed before then. thanks in advance for any input the program counselor just got back to me and said i will be done with the program as soon as i take both classes and pay the fees. thanks for your input! i would contact the program director to see what constitutes completion of the program and whether additional actions are needed outside of the assigned classes. the conditions of the program are to take an hour ethics class and an hour substance abuse education class i completed the substance abuse class and pay dollars in fees to human services. what do the conditions of your plea say?
