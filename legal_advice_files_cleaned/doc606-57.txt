hello legaladvice our apartment has laundry rooms maintained and operated by a laundry service. washer and driers are all $1.75 each per use. but when i check my credit card bill i see $8. even when i use the washer twice and the drier once i get billed $8 instead of $5.25. sometimes when i call and complain they send a cheque for the remaining money but i know how many people in the apartment call and complain. this looks like daylight robbery. it looks like like they fix it when they get caught. how do i make them pay for their deeds i'm in ca. #x200b; #x200b;
