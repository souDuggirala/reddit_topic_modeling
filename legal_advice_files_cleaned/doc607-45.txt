should i be worried do i need an attorney i’m fully insured with bodily injury covered to $100k but wtf. why would they get an attorney if we are both insured this all seems like a scam because the lady driver got out of the car and was fine until they called someone who screamed at them in a foreign language and then all of a sudden she grabs her back and acts hurt but then drives away just fine. i got word of the claim today. i’m petrified. hi genericusernamemom any update on your situation. i got in an accident a while back and then just heard recently the same claim. i'm in a tort or not a no fault state as well. though your coverage is very high so that is good for protection. mine is not though. im wondering what we can do to protect ourselves as i just have some pictures i believe. i bought a dash cam recently as well do i need an attorney not yet. just notify your insurance company asap and deal with it. make sure you cooperate with your insurer. not a concern. everyone sees an auto accident as a way to cash in let your insurance company handle it.
