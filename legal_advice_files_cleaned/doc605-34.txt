 the name change was done in maryland. i got married in massachusetts. —— so when i was 18 i put in the request for a legal first and last name change to avoid someone . i had a distant family friend who was a lawyer and said she would help me. i got a letter saying i had to appear in front of a judge and she said she would look into it and not to go worry about it. while this happened i moved out with my boyfriend to another state and after reaching out to her she blew me off. i assumed it was denied and went on with life still using my alias but with by original birth name on paper. 2 years later my husband and i got married. i used my birth name to get married. 6 months after getting married i received a letter from the lawyer and it was legal name change papers dated 2 years prior. so i got married under the wrong name and technically requested to have my last name changed to his. i did go out and get my drivers licenses and social security card changed to the alias using the name change papers. what does this mean for my marriage my taxes ect the end goal would be for me to keep my alias first name and take my husbands last name. can i just go back and put in a brand new request to change my last name i know this is so confusing.
