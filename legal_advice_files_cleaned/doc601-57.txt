like the title says i’m trying to get out of my home. i want to go into full detail but i really stay here anymore. i have no life or freedom my dad is controlling and manipulative and even physically abusive to my mother at times. i know that even at 18 i would not be allowed to willingly leave without a fight but i take living here any longer. i’m trapped in a cage i’m not allowed any form of freedom and rather die than stay here and at times i really feel like i’m already dead. you need evidence to be temporarily removed you would need more proof if you were younger because the remival is temporary but at this point the temporary removal will most likely last until aged out anyway. i’m worried if i did something like that they care because i have no physical evidence and would make me come back regardless. it safer to contact social services and say afraid to go back place you somewhere and you can stall until you age out. once you turn 18 an adult and can leave the home. no the authorities cannot force you to go back. however when leaving it may make it easier for you to notify the authorities that you are an adult and while your parents may be making a report of you missing you are fine and will not be returning.
