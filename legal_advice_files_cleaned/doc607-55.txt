if someone punches me in the face i demand that they do the “i’m a little piggy here my snout oink oink oink oink oink oink.” from south park while i record it or else i say to file a police report and threaten legal action. is this extortion i gain anything but i still threaten a lawsuit unless a specific action is taken of which the opposing party does not want to do.
