hello so a bit of preface. i live in scotland and work a job where i'm away for 2 weeks at a time. my sister t is starting to divorce her husband after they lived apart for a year he in the military and she had too good of a job to leave s was harassing her by phone every day over 70 calls a day and saying all sorts of horrible things. t and her toddler son are currently staying at my house temporarily. s has recently moved back into the area and thinks he can win t back but she want to he currently using their child as an excuse to see her on a very regular basis by guilt tripping her saying she withholding him from seeing his child. we have spoken to t about setting boundaries and sticking to them. today i found out s turned up at my house unannounced and spent a few hours there whilst i am away at work. i have sent him a message saying i do not want him in my house but i fear he listen and my sister not strong enough to turn him away all of the time. is there anything i can do to stop him from turning up or from entering my house sorry for the format and writing english is my first language but i only got a c in it at school haha and i'm writing this after a 12 hour shift with a ton of other stuff only mind. this is good advice. you can also install smart cameras that notify you of motion and get it on your phone. then you can call the cops if your sister do it. you can complain to his co as well and have a really really bad time. trespassing is illegal last time i checked call the cops on him his commanding officer can put the squash on his harassment pretty effectively.
