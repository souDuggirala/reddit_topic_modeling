we were contacted by a crime team who found other victims of this individual. they have their own proscecutors. iâ€™m probably not going to see any of the money back but i want this kid to go away. the judge set his bail very high and his lawyer wants it lowered so he can get out. basically this kid is saying he relased the money who steals money then just releases it you do that with crypto anyway. also this; he might get lowered bail if his defense team can prove he hace the money. you cant prove who owns a wallet in crypto it basically impossible. me and others lost a good amount of money. why does the judge think it matters if he gain anything which he did but is lying . so i can steal 10 million from someone mattress get caught but i lost it all in a fire so i get in trouble i get money back but seriously how can a judge have this type of logic you still committed the crime
