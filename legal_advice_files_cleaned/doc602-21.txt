i was in a mva in the last year and filed a lawsuit because of that. my attorney in that case said the insurance company for the long term disability through my former employer released all of my medical records including my mental health records to the defense. i never signed a release for them to do that and my attorney said the mental health records were meant to be privileged. he said i should seek council that specializes in this type of law because he does not know it nor have any referrals. is there anything i can do here thank you. is it possible you signed a blanket statement type of waive when you were hired typically phi cannot be released without written consent from a patient or a court order even with court orders hospital compliance departments have to "dig" into the case a little bit before they just hand over records. typically they will contact the patient as well but to answer your question: you can sue for anything but only have a chance of winning if you have proof or evidence. there is no private right to action under hipaa. you can file a hipaa complaint with hhs. keep in mind if you were suing based on medical costs then they likely have a right to review those records to determine if your costs were due to the event suing over.
