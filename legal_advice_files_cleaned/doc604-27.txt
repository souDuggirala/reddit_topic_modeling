hi! i plan on studying abroad in england for a semester this spring. i'm a little bit confused on how streaming will work while i am there. the short term visa states that i cannot work at all while studying abroad and the tier 4 visa states that i can work but only under a certain amount of hours and self employment is not allowed. i want to continue streaming while in england to build my audience but i am worried about the legality of what i can do. some places say that because on twitch i am paying us taxes and is through the us i will be okay but i am not quite sure. i want to get in trouble with the irs in another country lol good luck! thank you so much for your help though! i emailed the visa department of the university i am studying at and they sent me a very vague and confusing answer so this really helped a lot. try to get in contact with an employment lawyer ah. i have no idea about that. i recommend you check in with an employment lawyer or immigration specialist or something. in my experience the law has not quite caught up to the realities of digital nomadcy so it can be an actual nightmare trying to get an official line. i have a few people who have subbed to me for a year meaning i will make a certain amount of money each month regardless of if i stream. what do i do about this i'm very confused on everything rn if you either work at all or be self employed you cannot legally twitch stream for money. to which country you are required to pay taxes is irrelevant what matters is where you are conducting work and whether you are allowed to conduct work there as well as what constitutes work but that tends to be anything you make money from .
