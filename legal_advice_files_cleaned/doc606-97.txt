i was working for a company in nyc and decided to move out of state. my company decided to allow me to work remotely and shipped me a macbook pro rain stand and thunderbolt display. a month after i begin working remote my boss tells me i should start looking for a new job because "this was meant to be temporary" even though none of that was communicated to me had i known the non permanent nature i would never agreed to the remote work . four years later and i still have the display and rain stand. the laptop was destroyed in a fire which my former employer is aware of. i have made efforts to contact my former boss to get a shipping label but have never gotten one. is there ever a point that this property is considered forfeited by them or am i on the hook for this stuff forever until it gets returned to them somehow i want to pay out of pocket to send it back mostly. why you just return it
