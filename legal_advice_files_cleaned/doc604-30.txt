i made a t shirt design in photoshop and posted in . someone used the design without my permission and sell it on shirts made about 680$ so far can i do something about it i tried to contact him and he ignored my messages this is a mess. so you stole u hello_luigi artwork took a few minutes to rearrange it and slap it onto a t shirt design and then someone else steals that and sells the t shirts. and meanwhile the entire affair is trademark violation of the tv show. you have no legal recourse here. no you cannot do anything. if you want to give them a scare and maybe have them stop google a template for a cease and desist order. email mail them a cease and desist letter stating that they do not have permission to use the photo and you will pursue legal action if they continue to do so. spend more on legal fees pursuing this case than you would receive if you won. sorry. next time use a watermark.
