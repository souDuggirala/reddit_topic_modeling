so my husband and i need our window to be tinted at our new place of business. through his job he gets to know a lot of people. so if he ever needs anything done he always knows someone who does what he looking for. he met this guy there who offered to tint our windows. he works for an actual tinting place but he said do it on the side for less. we made a deal for $700 he asked for $300 upfront we gave it to him and he got started. he came in did a couple windows and said be back that saturday to finish. he calls the friday before saying his car broke down and if we could pay him the rest of the money upfront to get another car and see us the next day. saturday comes he show and keeps making other appointments dates to finish and just stops showing up. a month passed and we got fed up and we asked him for our money back. he says he going on vacation out of the country for 2 months and he give it back because he has bills to pay. we know he still in town because my husband has him as a friend on facebook and he been tagged in pictures at multiple events around town. we have messaged him multiple times we are friendly but he will just read it and not reply. what is our best course of action small claims how would that work should we speak to his employer thanks for the advice! last thing he replied was three weeks ago saying return $600 after he got back from ‘vacation’. he was supposedly leaving the week before thanksgiving. we know he ever go anywhere and seen he still around town. i will have my husband message him what you said. truly appreciate it.
