if i bought a gun from a private seller and used it in self defense while carrying it on my person what could i be charged with edit: in tennessee thanks for the intel your purchase would be legal. you carry without a permit which you get under 21 so that an unlawful carry or whatever the tn statute calls it. then there whatever you are charged with for the shooting. it is a common mistake to assume that if your shooting is justified you will not be charged with a crime. that is not true. you will often be charged arrested and booked and it is for a prosecutor to decide if they will prosecute you and then for a court to decide if your shooting was justified. plenty of legitimate shoots result in arrests and charges that were subsequently vacated simply because there is far too much investigating that goes into this process for an officer to do it on the scene. if there is any doubt about how things went down it is easiest to just arrest everybody who can reasonably be suspected of a crime and then let the justice system work its course. if you are carrying a weapon unlawfully and shoot somebody in self defense you will be arrested.
