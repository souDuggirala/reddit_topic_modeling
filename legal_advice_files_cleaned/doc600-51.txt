i have worked for an independent insurance agency for the past few months as a agent. they did provide some 'non forgiven' draw but i did not take much. they now want me to leave because i am not producing enough but they want me to pay back of draw. i did do unpaid work for them clerical things and they will get paid on all the renewals of the policies i wrote while with them they own the book of business . am i legally liable to pay the back? i have told them i will service my business until the renewals pay off the draw but they have already removed all my access to the company. this is in indiana btw working on a draw and having to pay back if you come in under that draw is generally legal in a lot of places. it going to come down to the exact agreement in place for that draw though.
