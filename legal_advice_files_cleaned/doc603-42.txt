mother passed away from alzheimer and my brother is planning to withhold bank information from probate to avoid paying creditors. he was poa and took care of mother finances. i also was poa but i did not manage anything and i do not know the details of any of said finances. i think the one he wants to hold back may be worth in the neighborhood of . he claims it will be more money for us and all the rich people do it. ; what are the chances he will get caught? is there a way the court somehow knows of the account when he fails to ? ; do i have any obligation to report him to the authorities? do i have to report the bank account to probate court myself? again i know of the account but did not manage it or know the exact amount it contains. ; my husband says i need to get a lawyer so it fall back on me since i had knowledge he was planning this. is he right? ; i know this is illegal and disagree with him. i want to get fined or jailed for his decision. i'm scared of what my brother intends to do please help reddit! yeah it will be a problem then. the estate needs to hire an attorney to administer the estate. this something you should be doing by yourselves. it depends i guess. pod accounts pass outside of the estate and creditors of the deceased have no rights to the money.
