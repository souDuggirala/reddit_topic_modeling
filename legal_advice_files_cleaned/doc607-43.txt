hello this is my first time posting here. i should preface this post by saying the most serious issue but i'm not sure where else to go for advice. i recently completed a large piece of artwork and someone has stolen it and is selling it on a clothing website. contacted them and asked them to take it down but i'm not sure if it will completely solve the problem. am i completely out of luck here is there anyone else i could contact that could help take it down got it thank you very much for your help. sure sorry. a company hired by the website owner is responsible for the website existing on the web being accessible and reachable via its domain name. like if it tshirts.com there the company that sells t shirts and someone else who runs the computer this is oversimplified you can reach by typing t shirts.com in the browser. godaddy or amazon web services for example. that who needs to get the dmca notice. i'm sorry i'm not super fluent in internet terminology what exactly is the web host serve the web host with a dmca takedown notice.
