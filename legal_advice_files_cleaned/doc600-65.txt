this about a wonderful friend of mine made a shitty decision. my friend call he jane had an extra marital affair with another man for a short time. this man didnt use protection and jane ended up being pregnant. all this is happening while she is un happily married. she went on with the pregnancy and delivered her wonderful boy abt 3 years back. there is no guarantee that the boy is born because of the other man. however because of the way the boy looks completely out side their ethnicity and the timing of the pregnancy she is certain that the boy is the result of the unprotected encounter. the birth hospital records every thing have the husband listed as father for the record the other man is also married and has his family. he kept in touch playing with jane emotions and asking her to let him see the kid once in a while. now she is afraid that the kid is growing and eventually would grow up confused. she wants to raise this kid just like the rest of the family where she and her husband are mom and dad. however the other man is now scaring her that he would go to court if jane decides to stop him from seeing the kid occasionally. i dont know this man well enough to figure out if he genuinely interested in the kid or he is using this as ploy to keep in touch with her. whatever the reason may be my questions are does the other man stand a chance when all the documentation says that husband is the father what happens if a court orders paternity test and it comes out in his favor does my friend have any legal standing to fight it out to keep him away from the kid
