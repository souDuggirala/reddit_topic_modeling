my sister was a witness 911 caller to an event where her ex attacked her other ex then current bf now fianc√© with an object being vague so she doxxed it is a felony aggravated assault charge . the case is going to trial and she received a summons in the mail. it says it will take 2 weeks she is very concerned about finances she can not afford to be off of work for two weeks. likelihood it will actually take the two weeks the best thing to do is for her to call the attorney who issued it. there are too many possible variables for us to guess on reddit. maybe they have a range of possible trial dates but not a set date maybe the trial will be conducted over nonconsecutive days maybe there really are a lot of witnesses and it will take 2 straight weeks regardless as only a fact witness it seems very unlikely that she will have to attend the entire 2 weeks. just call the attorney. the attorney probably just wants her to be available on call within a couple of hours notice during this 2 week period but that only my guess.
