i know it sounds redundant however i lived in the county when i took the civil service exam. i lived in the county from 1994 december 2017. i took this exam in 2016. i just noticed that there was a residency requirement. i no longer live in the county out of necessity i moved with my parents to a neighboring county then from that one to another one with my girlfriend. my grandmother still lives in that county should i spot my residency between where i currently live and where my grandmother lives. i have a lease under my name so it make sense to not live with my girlfriend at all. i want this to bar me from a job career in which iâ€™m qualified for.
