i recently learned that my father input my data into ancestry service about a decade ago without my consent . i am looking to exercise my right to erasure under the gdpr uk citizen in order to remove my data from the site however i'm not sure where to start. i found this email form but know what information i should include in my sar and how i should request for my data to be removed. their privacy statement lists how to contact them with any requests specifically sections 15 and 16.
