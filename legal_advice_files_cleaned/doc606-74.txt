the title pretty much sums it up. i bought my car brand new in 2014 and have had mechanical issues with it ever since. been to the dealership about a dozen times but it never gets fixed. it to the point where the manufacturer offered a 7 year extension on the transmission warranty for all those involved. been part of a mass action suit for about a year or so now but in this time been underemployed due to health issues and made a payment on my my car in several months. other bills were more important to me to keep myself afloat. should i let them repossess it and just cut my losses or is there any hope i may get something from this lawsuit for my continued trouble i hope it okay to ask this here and thanks in advance for the help. tldr: car has been trash since day one. manufacturer fix it. i been able to pay it in months. let it get or hang on to it for the lawsuit ask the law firm handling the mass action lawsuit. yeah just ignore the comment above. i know what best for you but hopefully someone who knows what they are talking about will provide you with some advice. thank you but it is a mass action not class action. i gave a set of lawyers and all of my correspondence states it a mass action. i know there is a difference between the two i just sure if a mass action being individualized would be more worth hanging onto it for. if it was a class action have gotten rid of it by now.
