hello i was overpaid by an employer after the end of my contract with the company. my former boss sent the amount without deducting the days after i had left he paid me for the rest of the month shortly after sending the money he had sent me another email explaining this and asking for the overpaid amount to be returned. key points: i was overpaid due to his mistake the overpayment was made 5 working days after end of contract the amount he requesting back is less than the amount i was paid i owe him anything more than i was paid the amount that would be remaining is incredibly small although i'm sure this affect anything this all happened a few hours ago #x200b; what is the legal position of this and do i have to repay this amount back #x200b; yes you owe the money. you earn it and your employer has the right to request you return the money. if they made a mistake and underpaid you would you expect that obligated to make up the difference of course you would. this is the exact same thing just in reverse. you get paid for exactly what you work no more no less. make arrangements with them to return the overpayment. you owe the money they overpaid period.
