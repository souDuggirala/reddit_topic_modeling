a bit of back story. im currently living with a friend who owns the house her cousin and one other mutual friend. the cousin is going through a divorce and the woman keeps toying with him about whether or not the divorce is actually going to happen and he keeps doing stupid things about it. so there i am getting a call from my friend to go downstairs before the police break down the door at midnight. i get out of bed and race downstairs only to find that the cousin had already talked to thr police and gotten them to leave. so i went back to sleep. the next day i learn that while at work with the cousins soon to be ex wife the ex wife had called the police to do a welfare check on the cousin because he was trying to get her to stay with him by acting suicidal. the ex wife was on the phone with the police when they were at our house and they could hear my friend telling the ex wife that she was getting someone to come down and talk to them. that didnt stop them from banging on the door with their flashlights leaving marks in the wood that the cousin took pictures of or stop them from breaking the deadbolt we put on the door. the house was built in the early 1900s and we believe that the door is possibly the original door to the house with the same handle we looked at it to replace it when we first moved in because we didnt have a key to it but its very complicated and we dont know how so we just got a deadbolt instead. do we have any options to be compensated for the damage done to the door and the deadbolt continuing from this if the call was made maliciously then you may have a criminal case. if you want this sort of meddling behaviour to stop here is your chance. the only one who should be doing any compensating is this cousin. this is all his fault. you get to punish the police for trying to help you when they think you are in danger.
