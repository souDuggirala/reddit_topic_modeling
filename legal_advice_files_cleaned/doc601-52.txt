my most recent former employer is a scam artist who is constantly turning over his employees who are all women. he never pays anyone on time and most recently just stopped paying everyone. instead of paying his current employees he just starts ignoring them when it comes time to pay and will just hire someone else to do the work. some of us are hourly and some are salary. when we ask for our pay he tries to turn it around and gets aggressive and mean and then says stuff like “i even know what work you have actually done” or will bash the work done or such of the sort to get out of paying. he eventually just starts ignoring everyone emails and messages about needing to be paid. he has caused so much distress to us all who are now jobless and been paid in weeks some even months. what do you do in this situation furthermore i also want this to happen to anymore women that he cons into working for him. like the bot says location is important assuming you are in the us you can file a wage claim to get the money you are owed. or sue for that amount the legality of hiring only women would depend on the work you do and the size of the company everyone affected by his inability to pay should immediately file a wage claim through your jurisdiction department of labor or labour standards ministry if possible. in jurisdictions where this an option florida georgia one or two other us states they can instead talk to an employment attorney; pooling their resources and hiring a single attorney between them is probably fine. gender based discrimination in hiring is of variable legality and is something need to know jurisdiction to comment on.
