so i am buying a house and and currently have 7 months left on my lease. i’m pretty sure i was told that if i cut the lease i would have to pay monthly until someone moved in. now i’m told i have to pay the remainder. i have the money for this on top of buying a house. the lease does not talk about cutting of a lease. if they agree i may have to move out and pay rent while attempting to find a new tenant. yeah i was told month to month which is fine. they are trying to tell me to pay the full remainder which is insane. to expand on this their damages include the costs they incur as a result of your breach of contract. generally you can expect to be charged some sort of reletting fee i.e. to market the place find a new tenant pay someone a commission in addition to the rent during your vacant months. their damages are mitigated once they have a new tenant which is why they would not be able to charge you beyond that. the law provides for them to be made whole so they are not incurring a loss due to your breach but not more. i find it very odd that the lease does not discuss what happens in the event you terminate the lease early. if the lease truly does not address this issue then this issue should be treated as a simple breach of contract. in which case you have the obligation to pay the full amount of the lease term. however the landlord has the duty to mitigate their damages. in other words they have to try in good faith to find a replacement renter. in this circumstance it might be best to talk to your landlord in advance and ask them if you can agree to pay monthly until they find a new renter as opposed to having to pay the remaining value of the lease. washington requires landlords to take reasonable steps to mitigate their damages so right. you would only have to pay rent until a new tenant is found and moves in.
