this question is for a friend. she was going to radiology technician school for 6 months but this particular school has just lost accreditation and will be shut down soon. i was wondering if anyone is aware of what she should do legally to get some sort compensation for all this time that she could have been working. she was making about 20 h since she had an xray tech degree but she had to quit her job to be able to attend this school. she cannot get compensation for "time she could have been working." depending on the location and the circumstances of the loss of accreditation and closure she may qualify for a discharge of federal student loans.
