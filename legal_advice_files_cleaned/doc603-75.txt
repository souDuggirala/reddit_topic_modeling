i just realized that my driver license expires tomorrow. unfortunately i will not be able to renew it until next week or possibly the week after. what happens if i get pulled over im finding mixed information online. i did find the florida statue law thing online but i know out how to read it. im in fl and have had friends run into situations like that where they just didnt have their license on them or it was expired. if you want a straight answer call the clerk of courts and ask them what the penalty would be and if they would waive a ticket on proof of a new licence may not work in your case as you are driving without one but they may also be able to tell you if their is a grace period . they will give you a ticket and when you show the clerk of courts proof of the update the waive it out of the system. cant remember if their is still a fee. but its like driving without proof of insurance once you prove you had it all along they wipe it.
