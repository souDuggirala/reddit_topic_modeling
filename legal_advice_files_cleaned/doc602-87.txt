this is my dream job ive wanted this job since i was in 6th grade. i called my family gave my two weeks etc. then they said they changed their minds. a company i worked for in ca did this and the guy sued and received a settlement. unless you signed something where your employment was conditional and you meet that condition then i would strongly urge you to consult with an attorney. from ops other thread it seems they changed their mind because he have a college degree even though they initially said that a problem. did you sign a contract or did you just accept a job offer did you fail a drug test or background check promissory estoppel detrimental reliance is a tricky area when it comes to offers of employment. i would take all your documentation and receipts to an attorney to review.
