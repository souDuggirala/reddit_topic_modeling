my question is in regards to a seemingly unreasonable out of network medical bill and possibly debt collection. late last year i visited the er for a ear trouble. my time in the room with the doctor was no more than 10 minutes they took a look at my ear and told me i should do a better job cleaning it and sent me out with a one time prescription for some stuff that would help clear them out. i received the hospital bill shortly after and was relieved to see it was below $100 since i did not have insurance. i payed the bill online and thought that was the end of it until this past week nearly exactly a year later. i received a letter from a debt agency informing me of an out of network medical fee from that same visit for $1 139. this is the first news of this additional medical fee that i have received when contacting the debt collector i was informed that the reason was an incorrect address even though i had received the hospitals bill at my current proper address right after the visit. is there anything that can be done that i should know about this situation call them and ask for a discount it cant hurt. i misunderstood the meaning of the word and assumed it meant not employed by the hospital. very sorry for my ignorance and thank you for the help. first i dont know why you are using the term out of network. you dont have insurance so there is no in or out of network. this is probably the bill from the physician which can be an entirely separate entity from the hospital. often times the info you give to the hospital isnt passed on to the physicians billing department which could explain why the hospital had your address info but the physician billers did not. services were rendered so you owe them money however i would suggest getting in touch with them to see if they can pull it from collections and work with you instead. they have to though. you can pay the bill now that you are aware of it. unfair does not equal illegal.
