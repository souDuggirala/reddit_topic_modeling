not sure if this is simple or not but here goes: my dad recently passed away in october of this year and left me as the beneficiary on his life insurance policy. he signed me over as beneficiary to the policy in november of 2004. my mother filed for divorce from him in april of 2004 and filed for custody of myself a minor at the time in may of 2004. their divorce was for some reason or another stalled after 2005 and not finalized until june 2008. part of her initial terms of the divorce in 2004 was that i be signed over as beneficiary to the policy. though my mom just told me she been talking to an attorney about contesting this due to california community property rules which apparently mean that since he signed me over as beneficiary during the divorce proceedings that she is still entitled to his life insurance policy. this is because she never signed the document on file at his place of employment which is required in california. #x200b; questions: is this accurate can this happen or since the divorce was finalized before he passed away does the final judgement retroactively enact me as the beneficiary or since she petitioned for divorce in april of 2004 does that constitute a "date of separation" please and thank you for any and all help.
