this happened in florida. so i was driving and this schoolchild was on his phone and decided to just leave the sidewalk and walk in front of my car on the road not even near to a sidewalk. i was looking straight at the road and there was a car on the other side so i swerve. i was goikg a total of 5 mph. i called emergency services and made sure everything was ok the child was walking away from the scene and i stopped him. for now i'm very grateful that he seriously injured. is it possible for me to be at fault i see that florida has comparative liability and i have no idea how this effects the case. the police told me everything is fine and that put me down in the report as not at fault with a witness testimony backing me up too but i know how the law works exactly. i definitely feel shaken right now even though i really do anything to avoid it. thanks for your help. just because a pedestrian suspend the laws of physics either. this is just such an unfortunate situation all around that why a dash cam is so important. so cheap but such a good investment. i mean i definitely breaked broke but it was too late for me to react. this is just such an unfortunate situation all around i think this would fall under "shared fault" you are always going to be reliable for your own safety anyone in your vehicle and pedestrians. just because someone was running across the street give you the right to not brake and not be conscious of the road. pretty sure that would qualify as leaving the scene of an accident under fl law especially without knowing whether the minor was injured or not. maybe. just because they were jaywalking mean you can hit them.
