sup reddit as the title suggests i have a question about unreported employment in germany. i'm a university student and since five years i'm working as a "ghostproducer" for a famous german musician on the side. basically i produce instrumentals beats for the musician to sing over he she claims it as his her own publically and pays me for it. until 2018 i made approximately 400 euros per month and let him her transfer a sum up to 3000 euros every few months to my personal bank account like once or twice a year. i'm pretty sure this counts as unreported employment just to be sure: does it but the sum was so small that i fear the tax office. this year however i made a whole lot more money. i currently have 10k to claim and could have it transferred to my bank account anytime. before that i already got paid 6k this year. the problem is i'm not sure if the tax office will get behind it. does anyone know how the tax office gets informed about payments like that would it be better to divide the payment in smaller ones and let it be transferred over the course of several months a buddy suggested i just let it be transferred to my old bank account in the old small village i grew up because they probably report it does this tactic really make a difference i'm thankful for any help. getting officially employed by the musician is not an option the best advice: go to the nearest police station report yourself for tax evasion pay your due taxes and get free with as little punishment as possible. nobody here is going to advice you how to evade taxes. there are legal ways for you to get paid. i'm not sure what the most no fuzz ways of doing this in germany are outside of setting up a company but i'm sure there are options for very light weight versions of entrepreneurship there like in most eu countries.
