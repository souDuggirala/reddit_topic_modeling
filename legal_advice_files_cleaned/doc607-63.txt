iâ€™m a semi driver and my truck was hit while legally parked causing a little over $13000 in damage. my truck has been in the shop for almost a month and is finally done but there insurance is refusing to pay for the damages unless i accept a low all offer for lost wages. my insurance has a $8000 deductible that i really afford right now so i really need there insurance to pay for the repairs. is it legal for them to refuse to pay unless i agree to sign and accept what there offering me for lost wages insurance is completely different by state need a state or we cannot even begin to help.
