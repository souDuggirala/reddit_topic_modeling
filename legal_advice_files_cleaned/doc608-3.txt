so to make this simple a close female friend of mine worked at walmart and quit recently due to how they treated her. well after a few days the filed charges on her for embezzlement up to 1000ish lets say if she did take money but no where near that number. regardless they have footage of course now adays how stupid could you be living in pa what is the possible outcome in court jail time fines felonys note up to this point a 100% clean record . what is the best idea to do lawyer up or take it yes but it often carries similar penalties i know if this is true in pa but feel free to check. i would but i am currently unable to and plus you actually ask about sentencing only if they were different charges which they are . however sentencing varies state to state and is often very fact specific thus i really guess her potential sentence. is embezzlement a different crime than just normal theft or larceny no one can guess what the outcome of your friend charges for stealing money from their employer may be. that depends on all kinds of factors we simply know. but your friend should absolutely retain a lawyer to represent them in these criminal charges.
