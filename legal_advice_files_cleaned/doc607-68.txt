a contractor caused very serious damage in our unit. we are the owners. our insurance has been great on our side and has been trying to recover costs from the company it been an uphill battle . given that we own a unit in a condo the condo has also been responsible for the “standard unit” items that needed to be replaced. now trying to get us to pay their deductible. is this standard should we be telling them no or passing this on to our own insurance thanks! you need to read through your condos bylaws to see if you are responsible for the deductible but from my experience with condos 20ish years living in them then purpose for dues is to cover these sorts of things not a lawyer
