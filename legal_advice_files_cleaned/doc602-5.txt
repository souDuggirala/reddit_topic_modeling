i currently live in wisconsin. my mom lives in louisiana where the the lease was signed. i’m only and never been sued so i have no life experience to lean on and my family friends have great advice either. my mom needed a place to stay and she has horrible credit so i cosigned a place for her. she promised pay rent on time etc. i was going on faith hold up her end of the deal. she finished the lease and moved out of the place july of this year. i thought everything was fine. today my mom was served papers and she being sued for thousands of dollars in water damage and missed rent by her ex landlord. i’m named as an additional defendant. my mom says she paid all the rent on time but i honestly feel i trust anything my mom is telling me. i know she have the money to pay what asking for and i have it either. should i get my own attorney or use the same one my mom is using? lived in a different state than my mom the entire time she was in that place but i’m guessing that probably matter right? am i in any danger of my mom somehow turning this against me or being forced to pay the amount in full? thanks in advance own lawyer. definitely. now. i understand you wanting to help but you are liable. so get a lawyer. they will proceed to request evidence of the damage etc. your lawyer will need proof your mom dud pay. if she gives an excuse you know she . but start with a lawyer. you cosigned the lease so that made you just as responsible as your mother. i would suggest getting your own lawyer to look out for your interests.
