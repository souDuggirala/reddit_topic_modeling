my friend sarah not her real name and i were in a room when another girl emma again not real name came in and got in sarah face. emma started yelling at sarah and then threatened to hit sarah. emma put her bags down as if to get ready to fight so sarah non aggressively backed emma away with her hands to get distance. there was no pushing or anything that could have hurt emma. emma refused to leave after many requests by myself and sarah so sarah went to the door opened it and demanded emma leave. finally emma left and we thought that was the end. however sarah was just contacted by the police that emma has pressed charges against her claiming that sarah gave emma bruises and broke her nail. both i and sarah know this possibly be true but we are worried that emma purposefully hurt herself to make sarah look guilty. is there anything we can do and can sarah get arrested tl;dr: emma and sarah had a fight but there was no aggressive contact made; however emma is claiming that sarah hurt her and now it emma word against sarah if your friend is charged you might be called as a witness but remember in our courts it not up to you to prove your innocence the state must prove your guilt thank you so much! i was mainly just wondering though is there any way to prove that sarah do anything even if emma has bruises self inflicted just for the record emma press charges. if there are charges filed against your friend then it the da who is doing it. emma possibly may have made a police report about the incident which may have led to charges. or she may be lying. if contacted by the police she should not speak to them without a lawyer. if she does find the da has filed charges she needs a lawyer.
