a few months ago the buyer was at closing and for some reason the required down payment increased heavily. due to this they walked away but were no longer covered by any mortgage contingency. which means the earnest money is owed to me but they would not sign it away. now because the guy is bad mouthing the his real estate agency rea in the community rea gave him the earnest money he paid and now rea want to sue me for the money if i release it to them. i lost about $8k because he walked away and now rea wants to sue me for the earnest money as something called legal assignment. if they were to sue me for this which they will lose based on the situation can i go after them for the full $8k since they are taking assignment or will i win the earnest money then have to file a completely different suit against the original buyer for the difference i have an expensive lawyer that know and if he researches it its going to cost me even more!
