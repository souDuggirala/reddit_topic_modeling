for the past 2 and a half weeks there has been an extremely run down rv parked in front of my house. people and a dog are clearly living in the rv and are leaving trash bikes coolers and various other items all over the sidewalk. it is parked on a very busy and dangerous street blocking the view to enter the street from one driveway and one alley way that leads to multiple houses. this obstruction has almost caused multiple accidents between both vehicles and cyclists. the police have been contacted by at least 3 separate people that i know of and i have reported the vehicle personally and filed an abandoned vehicle report. the rv has been flagged but i was informed this could take 6 weeks for any action to be taken on it. is there anything i can do to expedite this process thank you for any advice! calling the city councilperson is a really good idea as well. i will do that today as well as continue to file reports! as everyone else has said: keep filing complaints. in addition assuming inside the city limits of an incorporated city or town call your city councilperson office and complain to them and get your neighbors to do the same. unfortunately most of the major california cities are being inundated with people living in their vehicles so you have to keep reporting and complaining. make sure to mention that people are actually living in the rv; in my city san jose that explicitly illegal and may lead to a higher priority response. i have been but still nothing has been done. i have a feeling they have not been able to contact the people living inside so they are unable to tell them to leave tow the vehicle.
