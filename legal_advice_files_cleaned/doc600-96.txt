i'm am trying to get health insurance on my son from a previous marriage who lives out of state. i have called health network they directed me to blue cross blue shield. blue cross blue shield denied due to the fact i claim him on my taxes and he is not a dependent and referred me to medicare. medicare does not cover because he is not in state. can you guys help me out on where to try next.
