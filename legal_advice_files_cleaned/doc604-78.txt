so i stumbled across a new sms app that is supposed to analyze the messages you receive with an "artificial intelligence". this however is not done locally but the messages are sent to the company server where it has unencrypted access to them. when a message contains sensitive information about the sender they might have been okay with the receiver obtaining that information. but they never agreed that some dubios company had access to them. so sending that message to the company server infringe the sender privacy also if it actually illegal which party would have to face consequences the company or the user of the app or both i live in germany so if i have to specify a country that the one be most interested about regarding the legality of the situation described above. however i'm also interested in how the us handles this or if there are international laws about this. you have very little privacy when you send a text message. the recipient is generally under no legal obligation to keep the sms secret or confidential. this is from a us based perspective.
