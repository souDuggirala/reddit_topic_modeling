he is an all around d k and openly brags to family members what his only goal is to bleed the estate with legal charges so his sister is left with nothing. this has been going on for over 3 years on a low 6 figure estate. he had his new attorney formally depose his old attorney with questions that could have been answered with an email or a phone call. he has made no less than 20 trips from ohio to florida for "estate business" and is trying to charge all of those expenses to the estate. we have a trial date scheduled if the mediation fails and he is already pre planning a last minute family emergency to get it continued on the day of the trial if it comes to that. of which we have documented proof and a witness who is more than happy to show up in court and testify that he is lying. can this idiot be sanctioned for this can he get away with this if bil lawyer submits false evidence to the court then you can file a separate motion for contempt and a complaint with the state bar association. thanks for your reply. funny you say that. during that ridiculous deposition his attorney make an off the record comment to our attorney that made it clear that he already knew about the last minute family emergency. a person is typically not required to attend the trial unless he is a witness the trial can be handled by the attorney representing the estate. if bil submits false evidence to the court then you can file a motion for contempt. the court takes that kind of stuff seriously. if bil lawyer submits false evidence to the court then you can file a separate motion for contempt and a complaint with the state bar association.
