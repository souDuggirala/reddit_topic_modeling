hello i want to start a business. i have an idea and a plan and im pretty much ready to get started. however im also married and i dont have a lot of confidence for the marriage long term. i want to draw up a post nuptial agreement but i could easily see her not signing anything of the sort. what if anything can i do to protect myself and my business should she refrain from signing the agreement thank you very much. your state is incredibly important here. in some states a post nuptial agreement is not enforceable unless both parties have their own attorney. so this is not something that you can or should diy. get divorced now. you should speak to a family law attorney about your options but it very likely that your interest in that business will be a marital asset. if you want to prevent that and if your spouse willing to cooperate your only option will be to get divorced first.
