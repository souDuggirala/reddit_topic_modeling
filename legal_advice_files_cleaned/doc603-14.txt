i get along with my cousins from my dad side. they have had sleepovers at my house. but i like to go to their house. one time when i was 7 i was having a sleepover at their house. when i woke up i lifted my head and i saw my aunt near my feet. she was nibbling on my nails. it felt so weird so i pretended to be asleep. she then got up. i was going to my cousins house today. and thinking of what happened when i was seven i though it was a dream. long story short she was licking my toes today and taking pictures of my toes and feet. i need help what should i do can i file a harassment claim or something or should i tell the police troll. removed. nal but it sounds like she has a foot fetish. im curious it this qualifies as sexual assault. my advice is go over there any more
