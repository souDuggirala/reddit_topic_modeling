i believe i paid a debt collector a decent sum of money. i am not in the situation to be paying them and every time i do talk on the phone with them they seem knowledgeable of the situation. they had first called me multiple times without myself picking up but then they proceeded to call my place of work which led me to believe they were legitimate. they also had the same balance as they were claiming i owed my old university i have since graduated but as i read online it is easy to access these balances. what should be my actions going to forward to make sure i actually have paid off the debt and if they are fake then what would my actions be contact your bank immediately and see if anything can be done. the charge was not unauthorized but it possible your bank can do something. thank you i will call asap. i did make a large payment on the 23rd of november so about 10 days ago. i should probably call my bank i paid directly with my debit card yes looking back that was a very stupid thing to do. and i also did not question it til recently it could be illegitimate and never received a debt validation letter. call a credit reference agency. anytime a debt changes hands the new ownership gets stamped on your credit file that will let you know who actually owns it. contact the real company yourself using a phone number you obtained independently. as for recouping your losses if you already paid a scammer kinda s.o.l. on that one unless it was within the last 10 days or so in a short enough window you might be able to get a clawback from your debit or credit card company. how did you pay if you paid with itunes gift cards moneygram or western union you paid a scammer and will never get your money back. did you ever send a debt validation letter
