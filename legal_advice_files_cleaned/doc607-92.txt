the video is pretty old it is from 2006 i think #x200b; #x200b; it a video from a underground fighting production #x200b; #x200b; they let people fight without rules #x200b; #x200b; in most of their videos the fight gets stopped if someone is unconsciousnous #x200b; #x200b; but in this one the referee didnt stopped the fight despite the fact that the guy was unconscious and got hit mutliple times on his occiput by some heavy guy and after that the overweight guy lets hiself drop his knee 2 times on his head with his complete weight #x200b; the unconscious guy got a epileptic seizure afterwards for 30 minutes #x200b; im not sure what happened to him afterwards but theres a chance that he died a couple of hours later #x200b; he got his jaw broken along with a strong brain damage #x200b; #x200b; this has nothing to do with fighting this is a clear case of attempted murder #x200b; the most pathetic thing is that the recording guy was even filming the whole scene just 1 meter away with his camera #x200b; #x200b; i dont see the victim as a holy guy since he claimed in the pre fight interview that he once stabbed a guy in the neck #x200b; but it doesnt change the fact that this video is pure ignorance and injustice #x200b; #x200b; im not sure if im allowed to post the video here since it is pretty brutal #x200b; so if someone wants to see the video then just pm me #x200b; #x200b; so is there any chance to report this video to the police despite the fact that it a very old video #x200b; the video took place in california #x200b; but the problem is that im from germany so im not sure if a report from here to the usa police would be valid
