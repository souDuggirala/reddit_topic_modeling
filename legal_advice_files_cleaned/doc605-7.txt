i was messing around in photoshop and ended up making something that my friends thought looked pretty cool. however the photo i made was a conglomerate of 4k photos of water space etc. that i got from google images. the images i used are most likely copyrighted. you cannot tell from the image that i made that i used these photos since i "transformed" them so much. my friend suggested i sell it i probably sell this one but would i be legally able to do that i live in ohio u.s.a but i'm pretty sure copyright laws are a national issue lol probably just play it safe and try and use my own photos i have a drone that i can take photos of the sunset and clouds with which will get me a similar outcome . thank you for your input! hmmmm. honestly you might be able to get away with it. i could not tell where a lot of the source images were in your picture. you could probably convince a judge that this is different enough. the catch being of course you would have to actually go to court which is its own hassle. i’m just nosy but i loved this one i’m a music teacher . be interested in one. here are the photos i used to create the final product: imgur and here is the final project: imgur i'm just getting started with photoshop at school and i probably wouldnt sell something like this anyway the girl playing trombone is a friend from school ga attorney here. the test that i like to use when determining if something has been sufficiently "transformed" is seeing if the transformed version could be used as a substitute for the original. photos of water and space are tricky. i'm not sure how you could sufficiently transform a photo of water or space. i would have to compare whatever you made with the original photos. for right now i would hold off on selling it.
