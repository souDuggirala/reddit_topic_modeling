about 2 years ago i joined a gym and surprise surprise never really went. to pay for this the gym was drafting from my debit card every month. well that card was compromised and i have since gotten a new card. i have also moved to different town. i believe that met the time frame for which i'm allowed to cancel without paying anything extra. however last time i tried to cancel they said i because i still had some time and something about i also because even though i moved they had another chain within 40 miles of my new city. anyway they have sent emails saying they draft my account anymore but my question is do i have to give them my new card info or can i just keep ignoring them i think i gave them my social or anything so i think they could report me to a collection agency or anything plus saying i owe them like $200 in late fees which like to avoid also. gyms are notorious for having really complicated cancellation procedures. you should follow their guidelines for cancellation and then call go in and do a 1 time payment for all the late dues fees. if you do a 1 time charge for a very specific amount then if they try to be scummy and put you back on auto charge you can do a chargeback for any charges past what you agreed on . removing the method of auto payment does not release you of the liability for what you agreed to pay in the gym contract. read your contract for clauses that outline the specific cancellation procedure you must follow then follow it. simply stopping paying when contractually obligated to pay is going to get you sued or sent to collections. do not ignore these fees! even without your social they can take your debt to collections. it would be better for you to just pay it. not paying is not a good way to cancel a gym membership. here are two sources that can give you more info: you need to properly cancel the membership. not giving them your card number will just result in more late fees and more monthly fees accumulating.
