my husband and i got custody of my stepson a few years ago because the mother was caught prostituting herself out . her parents helped us get custody at that time because they were worried for their grandson they were living with the grandparents at the time . now the mother has a daughter and according to my stepson she is mistreating the daughter. my stepson lived through many years of verbal and physical abuse by her before we were able to get custody and now when he visits he sees his mother pushing his little sister around in the same way. he worried about her and so are we. is there anything we can do in another state and obviously we have no rights to the child but we are concerned for her well being and would take her in in a heartbeat. any advice call cps in their location. report everything heard. tell them willing to be a placement if family an option.
