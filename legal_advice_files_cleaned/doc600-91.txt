a little background first. so i’m getting a divorce not my choice . ive stayed home for six years taking care of kids while my partners career has taken off. my family has moved out of country for two years to further their career. promotions over the last six years has led them to being one of the top 3 4 people in company that has been privately owned. recently the company has sold for a very significant sum and this is where my question stems from. they are receiving an upfront bonus in january that they are willing to split. however there is disagreement as to the remaining bonus they will be paid over three year period. my partner will be getting two payouts over the next three years. one will be a payout from previous ceo but new owners want them getting it all up front. they want it paid over time by meeting metrics the other payment will be retention from new company also based on meeting metrics. they consider this future work that i should not be entitled to. i understand anything legally vested while married is marital property but i’m concerned that they only have a verbal agreement with former ceo so if not in writing at i not entitled to that even though they will be receiving bonus. for the new company i have no idea if anything is in writing but i would assume so. they are also one of only four employees receiving stock options in new company. what am i legally entitled to on either front any advice appreciated. this is something that your divorce lawyer can help navigate in court.
