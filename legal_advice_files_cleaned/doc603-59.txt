 ny hi i work 12+ hours days as a waitress sometimes part time job and i only get one half hour break. that it. i was just wondering if this is legal. most workers who are working a full time shift are entitled to a meal break period at some point during their shift. workers who work a shift that is at least 6 hours long and lasts between 11 am and 2 pm are entitled by new york labor laws about breaks to a half hour unpaid meal break for lunch. workers who start work before 11 am and end after 7 pm are entitled not only to their lunch break but an additional 20 minute meal break between 5 and 7 pm. if you are an employee who works more than 6 hours starting any time between 1 pm and 6 am you are entitled to a mid shift 45 minute unpaid meal break according to ny labor laws about breaks. factory workers receive special treatment in new york labor laws about breaksâ€”instead of the 45 minute break they are entitled to a full hour. if you work a shift that is shorter than 6 hours ny labor laws about breaks do not entitle you to any break time for meals. source:
