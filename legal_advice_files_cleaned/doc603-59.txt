 ny hi i work + hours days as a waitress sometimes part time job and i only get one half hour break. that it. i was just wondering if this is legal. most workers who are working a full time shift are entitled to a meal break period at some point during their shift. workers who work a shift that is at least hours long and lasts between am and pm are entitled by new york labor laws about breaks to a half hour unpaid meal break for lunch. workers who start work before am and end after pm are entitled not only to their lunch break but an additional minute meal break between and pm. if you are an employee who works more than hours starting any time between pm and am you are entitled to a mid shift minute unpaid meal break according to ny labor laws about breaks. factory workers receive special treatment in new york labor laws about breaksâ€”instead of the minute break they are entitled to a full hour. if you work a shift that is shorter than hours ny labor laws about breaks do not entitle you to any break time for meals. source:
