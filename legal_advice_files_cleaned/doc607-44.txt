my aunt did something very sweet but that could come back to haunt her. i'm trying to help her figure out what to do before that happens. basically my aunt inherited a decent car and decided to gift her beater to one of the kids she saw around the neighborhood a lot. the title was not signed the plates were not removed nothing. she does not know who the kid is. literally has no name and seen him around. presumably according to every state authority she still owns the car and i would assume is still liable for anything that happens with it. she will not report it stolen because well that would be cruel to the guy that was just minding his business when someone gave him a car. are there any other legal options for eliminating liability essentially saying she no longer possesses or owns the car any help appreciated! arkansas #x200b; so they will allow her to essentially abandon the car the dmv seemed to think this a possibility without actually transferring the title and especially without a name. i'm seeingg the office of motor vehicles as a potential alternative. thanks for your help! your aunt needs to go to the appropriate county agency the one that handles tags and titles and report that the car has been gifted and has changed ownership now. if the current ed not driver gets a ticket or wrecks it she will show as the legal owner. no it was not wise. this needs to be rectified rapidly before it does come back on her. furthermore the new owner cant get it titled or insured as it is not in his name.
