a few years ago my family had this annoying neighbor who would call the cops on us for dumb stuff like my dog barking too loud bit told the police on the phone that we were harassing his daughter my family seen his daughter in like 10 years . eventually he put up a camera that was built to look like a bird house it was obviously a camera we inspected it . he had it on the tree line diving our properties. he had the lense pointing toward our backyard and it was constantly there. without knowing for sure we told him that was illegal and call the cops if he take it down. so he took it down. i guess i'm just wondering if we had any grounds to say that was it actually illegal what he was doing no. you may contact the mods if you wish to discuss this further. thank you backseat moderate in this sub. you should know better than that. comment removed. most the people on this sub are not lawyers however if you think you can do better tan me feel free to look up the law and prove me wrong because if i am willing admit it. sorry when i say "public" here i am including the neighbor. he can obviously see them from his property since that is where the camera is located. ianal oh ok i see. thanks dude what makes you say it was readily observable by the public it is legal since you have no expectation of privacy in this scenario because you were outside and it appears your area was readily observable by the public i.e. from your neighbors lawn . ianal edit: in response to a comment to be clear my post is not just informed by a google search. the link was merely for the op to utilize i need it. shit sorry oakland county michigan i need your location
