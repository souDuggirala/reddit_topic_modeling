ut! so a few months ago i was involved in a car accident in lv in a company truck not my fault. their insurance cover the accident for some reason. not to mention they only had liability insurance as well anyway. i was working for this person and they decided to keep my check to cover the damages done to the company truck. i know that can not be done so what should i do? i’m sorry if i explain this right if you need more info be more than glad to give. thanks! you consented to the deduction; withholding your entire check is legal under those circumstances. you said "take the one after this one". that is clearly consent. i did but not with the check that was coming up. they said they would take it from the check after this weeks and i specifically said “okay but take this check. take the one after this one i have a lot of bills that need to be paid” and they said “okay we take this one.” did you give them permission to take it out of your check? this has already happened though. they took the wages and i quit entirely send them something in writing indicating that you do not consent to any wage deductions. if they do it anyways file a wage complaint. here another part of the story he told me he was going to do this; but not with that check. he said he was going to do it with a check two weeks from that date; does that change everything? i said he can but not with that check. i said he could take the check after this one wages can only be deducted pursuant to a federal state or local court order or with the express consent of the employee. so no they cannot do this. you should contact your labor board and file a wage complaint.
