so i accidentally broke a window in a university accommodation and they have charged me £603 when i am in my overdraft they quoted the amount as £200 £300 when i spoke to them. the worst part is that they are charging £170 for the call out to fix it but overall i think the price is extortionate. to add to this they have not shown me the evidence they claim they have of me breaking this window and i think that it exists. what should i do
