this is the story as it was told to me by my friend who is currently in jail. i have any information myself so i realize my friend may not have reported everything accurately. i have a friend who was visiting a relative at the relative home last night when police were called for a dispute between two other unrelated guests. police ended up searching the home and found drugs. they asked who the drugs belonged to and no one at the house came forth so they charged everyone. my friend was charged with trafficking in a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia. he had just gone down for a couple of hours to visit and really know the two other people who supposedly had the drugs. my friend has had previous drug charges years ago for which he went to prison but he has been on the straight and narrow for over a decade as far as i know. he just continues to hang out with sleazebags for whatever reason but he is afraid his history of drug charges will result in him going to prison again. he cannot afford a paid lawyer or his bond. like i said i realize that people are capable of anything and my friend story may entirely be false but i was looking for some kind of silver lining for him and to kind of determine what his chances are if his story is true. thanks in advance. never posted here before and my legal knowledge is minimal so i will add any details that are necessary. your friend needs a criminal defense attorney. if he cannot afford one then need to ask for a public defender.
