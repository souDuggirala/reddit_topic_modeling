i have worked for my employer for over 7 years. on october 1st of this year i changed my employment status from full time to part time. three weeks before the start of my part time status i signed a form stating that i will not qualify for insurance benefits if i do not maintain full time hours. this was just fine as i moved onto my husbands insurance. i filled out and signed the form and my manager was to send this to all the appropriate parties including our hr department. since making this change i have not been putting in anywhere close to full time hours. #x200b; fast forward to yesterday i was finally given new login information to a website where all of our benefits and payroll information can be found. i opted out of all of the benefits and submitted. out of curiosity i decide to have a look at my paychecks and realize they have still been deducting the insurance benefits that i no longer qualify for. this totaled up to almost $1 200. i contacted our hr department and i was informed that they were not told of my full time to part time change. they would stop further deductions but i will not be refunded that money because it falls outside of a 30 day refund policy. #x200b; what are my options here am i really boned out of this money because my manager did not forward this to our hr department do i have any recourse #x200b; #x200b;
