when i 23f was 16 years old i went on a school trip to germany. the assistant principal was one of the chaperones. during this time he grew close to me. he began to joke about me stripping at the local strip club. he also took me to the nude section of the local park. it was empty but he grabbed me from behind and pushed the front of his body against mine and told me to imagine a bunch of naked people in front of me. #x200b; during my senior year he went out of his way to touch and hug me. as a result i was left with ptsd. #x200b; i never reported it because i felt guilty about the situation for a long time. today one of my friends who is getting her teaching degree had to be in the same room as him. he is currently the head principal at one of the rival high schools. he has access to young girls on a daily basis. #x200b; according to pennsylvania law i can report this until i am 30 years old. is it worth pursuing or have i waited too long to do anything about it the rival hs is in a different school district but still in the same county and state. the event happened in germany but the touching continued through the rest of my time at the high school in pa. yeah but it was a school event so the district could possibly still do something. not sure if the rival hs is in the same district or not . you have until 30 to file a civil suit . you have until 50 to report it as a crime. the hink in this situation is that it happened in germany. have i waited too long to do anything about it well as you say not according to pa law. he should not be in charge of children. report him.
