my boyfriend \ 23 russian mres\ and i \ 24 british ba\ want to live in the same country as each other. this is proving harder than expected. i get a russian visa and his british student visa is expiring next month. been searching for a country that would be easy for the two of us to move to but we had much luck yet. new zealand for example would be easy for \ me\ to move to it offers a year long working visa for british citizens. however for a russian this type of visa would not be available. #x200b; we were hoping that you could help us out. are there any countries which have equally relaxed immigration laws for british citizens and for russian citizens ideally the country would have to be english speaking or failing that somewhere in europe.
