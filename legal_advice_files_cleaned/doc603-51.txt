location california posting for a friend my friend is asthmatic and at their work they have these scented air machines all over the place that make it almost impossible for them to breathe. when the employer was asked about this they merely responded with “deal with it.” despite one or two medications my friend most certainly cannot just ‘deal with it.’ my friend is already in the process of getting a note from their doctor outlining their condition and requested accommodations but worried the employer still do anything. what would be the next step if that were the case so they have a note yet until the employer is given notice of the disability and the employee requests reasonable accommodation there is nothing the employer needs to do. if no changes happen after that he may have an ada claim against the employer. the next step at that point would likely be speaking to california department of labor for now i advise he screenshot any emails or texts pertaining to this and putting copies in a google doc on a personal email not a work one and printing out copies for himself at home. he should continue to explain the condition after the doctor note should the employer refuse and document with time and date stamps that he informed them if possible he may want to record conversations though have to ask directly if he consents to a recording though that likely necessary now.
