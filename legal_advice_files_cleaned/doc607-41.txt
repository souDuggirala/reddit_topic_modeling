long story short i'm mentally and physically disabled and while i work am limited to how much i can work and i live on 250 dollars a week before rent etc so me getting insurance is completely out of the question. we are going to move when the lease is up. i live in a house that been converted to units. the ceiling above my lounge room leaks. in about 6 months of living here it leaked about 4 5 times. it usually is from the left hand corner which is below another tenants bathroom there is nothing wrong with the pipes but the water proofing in the bathroom is shot. however this time it came from another spot while we were sleeping so i'm not 100% what is going on. we keep letting the real estate know who keep sending out a plumber but as he a plumber he able to fix the water proofing etc. i have proof of us contacting the real estate because i email when issues arise. my partner believes if it leaks and ruins something of ours the landlord would be responsible whereas i believe that would fall to us and because we have contents insurance we would be out of pocket though i am wondering because it a known issue that been resolved whether that will change things
