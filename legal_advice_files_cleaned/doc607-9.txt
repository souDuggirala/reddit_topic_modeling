background: i live in milwaukee wisconsin #x200b; last night i was walking and tripped on a section of sidewalk where an entire square chunk had been removed and there was dirt and gravel below. it was dark and there was no warnings or cones up to signify that a huge part of the sidewalk was gone. i ended up in the er getting stitches and a large rock fragment removed from my knee. i have insurance but the deductible is really high and i'm worried have to pay what will likely end up being a huge hospital bill out of pocket. is the city liable for the sidewalk being a safety hazard how would i go about pursuing this if so thanks for the advice! thank you for your help! i believe it is a city sidewalk as it is not in front of a house or business. depends who is responsible for the sidewalk. if it the landowner you can make a claim on their insurance. if it the city you can make a claim against them but it will likely be harder to recover. talk to an attorney.
