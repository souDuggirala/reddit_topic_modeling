we bought a townhome with the intent on renting once we moved but a year after we bought the place the hoa ruled to change the bylaws so that the properties could no longer be leased. any idea if we legally can still rent ours since we took ownership before they amended it it the same young families just outnumbered by a wide margin thus elaborating on the them vs. us dynamic. the homeowners association is not "they" it you. the condominium homeowners associations i have belonged to can only make changes like this by a vote of the membership. members are notified before such votes and may comment and vote against proposed by law changes. it easy to toss the notices and sometimes excruciating to attend the board meetings but at least you will be prepared. it may be different in your jurisdiction. not a legal question you have to read the hoa documents including that specific bylaw and see if there a grandfather exception. by purchasing a home with an hoa you agreed to abide by the bylaws. unless there an exception you rent as you agreed to all current and future bylaws. jurisdiction might matter here but in general bound to the rules in force now not the rules in force when you took possession.
