so i live in croatia and im going on a school trip soon. we were told that we have to be in our rooms by eleven im fine with this and that a woman was going to confiscate our phones during the night. is this legal. and can i do anything about it. tried looking trough the constitution to find something that prevents hwr from doing this but i have failed. does anyone have advice. yeah i thought so but it was worth a try that seems like the logical sulution bring an old phone give it to her and hide your real one. boom. you find anyone super familiar with croat law here.
