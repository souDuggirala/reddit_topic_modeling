i know i have. but i did. i wrote #metoo on the school bathroom stall. below it i wrote “you too leave a tally mark.” i’m not so concerned about getting in trouble for the graffiti itself because the walls are covered in it. i’m more concerned because a school with minors can the school start an investigation to try and locate me due to the fact that #metoo is associated with sexual assault.
