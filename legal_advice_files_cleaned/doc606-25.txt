i'm a current practicing but non believing mormon. the church of jesus christ of latter day saints also known as the mormon church has dishonest leaders who have started saying they want anyone recording their public talks. that way there no record or proof of anything they say and they can gaslight members who want to point out errors or lies. i'm in ca and at one of these large local meetings a very high up leader will be attending he known as an apostle in our church . i want to know if it illegal to record a public talk mormons always profess visitors are welcome so invited the public to hear their talks and sermons in the name of "missionary work" inside a private building. the mormon church has a hell of a lawyer firm that works only for them kirton mcconkie. this lawyer firm only job is to protect the image of the church and to attack any dissenting voices and i want to tangle with them. is it worth it to record the talk of an apostle which is given in public but on private property or will this put me in serious danger of a lawsuit my purpose was in sending the recording to mormonleaks. they expose the mormon church many despicable practices that go on in secret and mormonleaks has been keeping them accounts.
