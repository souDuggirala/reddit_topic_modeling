i recently sent a spoofed email to some teachers from another school saying a few things about a few of the students which are friends of mine. the email was sent from the email of another kid i know. the friends didnt take it as a joke and will probably be called down to the office tomorrow. i sent a follow up saying that it was all a big mix up. i was just wondering how much trouble they could get in for my false claim of "cyberbullying" which i know isnt a big deal. and how much trouble i could get in for the spoofed email. i'm in pennsylvania usa. this a legal issue. the school can punish you as they deem fit.
