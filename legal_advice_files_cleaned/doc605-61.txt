i'm being exploited and censored by my area cultist theocracy. i live in ohio. i'm afraid they will call me incompetent arrest me and send me to a psychiatric unit like they usually do. what defense do i have ohio does not have an euthanasia statute. you are unlikely to find a physician or pharmacist to assist you. such a statute is currently under review by the ohio legislature so this situation my change shortly. op that has to be very scary for you. are you currently in treatment or have you received a recent psychiatric diagnosis
