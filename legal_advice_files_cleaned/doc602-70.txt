i got into a physical altercation at my school back in august. the student was disrespecting the teacher and kept calling her a "bitch" and i finally stepped in. i told him to stop and after words were exchanged and he got in my face and pushed me. i responded by punching him on the face and took him to the ground where he busted his eyebrow. in the middle of this his friend jumped behind me while we were on the ground and began hitting my back. when i stood up his friend hit me in the face from behind. the friend is was on probably probation for armed robbery and breaking and entering and a few other charges. the officer on campus told me i going to be charged but come to find out i'm being charged as a minor for battery. what can i expect? no no i mean confused too it better to come clean so they can work with you on this. if they find out the wrong way they will not be happy. you better tell them fast. they are going to find out anyhow and you need them to get you a lawyer. delete this post and do not talk to _anyone_ about this except your parents and lawyer. my parents even know what going on just because the officer tells you that you being charged mean it true. you should stay off of here and talk to a parent or trusted adult.
