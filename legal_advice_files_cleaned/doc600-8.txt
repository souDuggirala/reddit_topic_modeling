just looking at what options i may have here. former employer agreed to pay me monthly distributions for earned commissions that add up about $60k. since september has only paid twice each time i have to twist an arm to get a check. i have paper trail for this agreement. last check was received first week of october nearly two months ago. owner has been telling me for the past 3 weeks "a check is in the mail" but nothing arrives. super frustrating and causing a lot of stress as i still factor this into my personal budgeting. if contacting him keeps failing or i keep receiving the same default response should i contact a lawyer to send them a letter or something that makes sense. if you worked in maryland then you file the complaint in maryland. thanks! employee not contractor. their hq is in philadelphia would i file here in md or pa were you an actual employee or a contractor if the former file a wage complaint with the maryland department of labor.
