so you get pulled over by a cop while driving drunk and you have your trusty floor vodka on hand. so you roll down your window toss your keys out of the window in view of the officer. then chug half of a bottle of vodka. will this avoid me getting a ticket for driving drunk because i got drunk in my car without the possession of keys and all the tests wont work because i got "drunk" in my car. you are my fucking hero randomly throw something out of the window when stopped by a cop. this is a very quick way to get yourself shot. also drink and drive. hypotheticals are not answered here. try no but it may get you an additional ticket for an open container.
