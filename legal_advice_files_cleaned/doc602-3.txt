just got a speeding ticket for the first time. i was caught going in a down the service road. i was told to wait at least days to contact the court in order to pay for it and go to defensive driving school to remove points. however i’m wondering if there is a better course of action to take? read about people hiring lawyers and getting the ticket to be dismissed without even showing on your record you ever had one. my understanding is that going to driving school will reduce points but will still show a speeding ticket on my record. is hiring a lawyer a better course of action to try to never get the ticket on my record in the first place? how do i know i’m hiring a good lawyer? will the cozy end up being about the same as a ticket anyway if i do choose to hire a lawyer? i appreciate any help advice. thank you texas dallas dfw area more specifically location? some states have different options. fair enough. thank you. what would be your defense to the ticket? fine plus driving school is pretty standard. you sped and got caught this is what happens.
