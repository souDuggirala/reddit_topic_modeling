boss bought some trucks in utah and i am supposed to drive them back to california but he bought them at auction and there are not plates. are there any permits ore special registration i need if you go through nevada need proof of insurance as well. it a big ticket here. did you have any paperwork on the vehicle or were you just given keys and told to drive no. ram 2500s. thankfully are these heavy duty commercial trucks you will be a lot more especially when you get stopped at the truckee weigh station what if i'm not the owner i'm just the guy my boss flew out here to pick it up. a 96 hour permit is what the owner needs to apply for. so i just go to the dmv and ask for that then you need to make sure that temp tags get issued. otherwise just asking to get pulled over. yes. go to the utah dmv and get a temp registration for moving. i think there any temporary tags. i even know the trucks have license plates till i got here are there any permits ore special registration i need i'm assuming a cdl to drive the truck needed to tow the vehicles. because unless you were issued temporary tags for the vehicle not supposed to drive a vehicle without a license plate.
