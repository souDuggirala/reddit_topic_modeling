iâ€™m currently a junior in high school they brought drug dogs to our parking lot and my truck got flagged out. they searched the truck and only found a bottle of vape juice and a pod for a suourin air they said they were gonna charge me with a underage tabacco charge 2 to be exact because i say where i got it from. later that day they called me back into the office and said if i get into any trouble that could result in an any form of a charge i will be charged with the pervasive offense and one from a year before when they found a vape on me. can they do that or are they just fronting help location stop talking to the police. tell your parents you need to speak to a lawyer.
