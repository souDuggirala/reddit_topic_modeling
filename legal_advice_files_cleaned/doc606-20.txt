nevada my divorce decree specifically outlined what my now ex wife was to take from the house. she took extras not outlined or every discussed. specifically appliances such as washer and dryer which were mine before marriage. is that theft contempt of court she says her lawyer adviced she was free to take them but again they were mine before marriage and never discussed and i'm sure he banking on me fighting and getting more money. advice please. fck! thank you! that exactly what i was thinking! spend $2k on a lawyer or half on a new set. 7 years old after all. and the dryer is gas! really sell that where i'm at! it will depend on exactly what your decree says. unless they are a really nice washe set it is likely not worth going back to family court over. probably cheaper to just replace them and move on. if you have a lawyer you should consult him or her
