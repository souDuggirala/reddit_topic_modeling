we just separated a couple days ago and not sure where to start or if i should get a layer or what. our child has my last name and live at my house that i own. i want to take the child away from the mother but i do not want her to try and take her away from me i dont think she will but i want to be safe and dont want to lose my daughter. i just want to get my ducks in a row and not get fucked. i believe she has 100% custodial rights since we had our daughter out of wed lock but i'm not sure on that. #x200b; thank you for reading. did you put your name on the birth certificate if so i think you have some legal jurisdiction over your child. also depends on where you live.
