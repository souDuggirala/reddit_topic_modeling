hello all throwaway obviously i have joint custody with my ex. i get my 5yr old daughter every other week for a full week. anyways my daughter has told me today that my ex fiancé has shot her and the cat with a bb gun a few times completely random statement from her. i pulled out my phone and recorded it. apparently he shot her with it when she had a blanket covering her. i ask the daughter about any other weapons in the house and is that bb gun accessible to her and she says it on the dvd tray next to the tv says there is swords and other guns in his closet at home that she can get but says she . anyways i message my ex and ask her about these claims and she says that it not a bb gun but an airsoft gun and they thought it would be fun. i am pissed about this. i called the local sheriffs office they said i just need to come down and make a report. also to contact dfs. would an attorney help in this situation would getting full custody criminal charges against them be possible if there are no bruises but text message proof i got proof over text messages from both the ex gf and her fiancé and they both said they did it also my daughter saying it on video it seem to bother them about it either which i’m completely lost for words. any advice is appreciated i feel like i’m on the right path if i’m over reacting please let me know with todays society can never be too careful. #x200b; this is the first ever incident with my ex other than this everything has been civil i suppose. in the state of missouri by the way. joint custody was granted around 1year old. there is no abuse. it was basically a toy gun. if you feel your child is in danger contact cps and let them investigate.
