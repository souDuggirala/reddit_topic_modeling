so this a long story but i will try to shorten it as best as i could. for some info i am i live in istanbul turkey. i live in an apartment with my sister and parents. we first came into this apartment about years ago. years went by and everything was cool but suddenly. the land lord came to us and told us that every year he going to raise the rent. of course this is when the trouble began. we waited a while and paid our rent normally until about a month ago we decided to move out. so my father asks him for the insurance back. and the land lord declines saying that he will give the insurance back only when he finds someone to move in to the apartment. of course my father gets angry and starts talking with him in phone texts and the land lord says a long something a long the lines of "i can give you a bill so high you be able process it." and that all of the story this happened about just an hour ago btw. so what do i do reddit? i assume by "insurance money" you mean the security deposit? not entitled to that until after moved out and if you move out without giving proper notice the landlord may be able to use the deposit to cover rent until a new tenant is found. edit: ignore everything i said. i have no idea what the laws in turkey are. i assumed you were in the us. no we move out. we wanted to move out and so we told the land lord for the insurance money. still in the same apartment. so you guys moved out without giving proper notice?
