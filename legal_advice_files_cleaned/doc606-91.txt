hello i am in the middle of a custody battle and my girlfriend of three years just left me. my name is on our lease so there is no imediate threat of me losing my home. i use one of her cars but i only use it until i can get my own car. my question is will it hurt my chances in court if my son and mother find out me and my girlfriend split.
