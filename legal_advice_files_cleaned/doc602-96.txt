location: pa us at the beginning of october i had to take my wife into the hospital multiple times. due to her condition she was not able to communicate with the doctors so i was there to do so. as such i used the remaining sick and vacation time i had at work to cover the time i was out. i was out from . this was for a pay period from and was paid without incident on . after this whole situation was over i returned to work and my immediate supervisor told me to call absence management and retroactively file that time as fmla. i did so and the fmla time was approved as of . from what i was told this would just cause the days i was out without prior notice to be "protected" time and not affect a performance review or raise. my most recent paycheck was on for pay period . in that paycheck . hours of vacation time and . hours of sick time were deducted from my current earnings with no explanation. after several phone calls with payroll i found out that since my fmla was from and the vacation and sick time is "accrued" the first of every month that the time i received at the beginning of october has been rescinded hence the reduction in pay. i'm currently arguing with them over the point that they initially approved and paid it and that the fmla time was filed not as my own choice. they would have paid that vacation time and sick time had i not put in the fmla paperwork as instructed to do by my boss . so my question for you is can they take away pay that has already been approved and paid to me?
