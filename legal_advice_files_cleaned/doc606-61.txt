this is the text i got from a co worker from a summer camp. â€œ u piece of shit did u write a letter to michelle exposing all of us. do u have anything better to do w ur life honestly. take the letter back or i will tell michelle how u hit on every girl there and made them uncomfortableðŸ˜Š â€œ i know what i can do about this if anything. if it helps iâ€™m in montreal quebec. so yeah. thanks in advance guys alright thanks! will do respond and definitely show the text to your boss or hr if you have it. even if you did write some letter she has no right to threaten you. honestly sounds like a pretty hostile work environment if it important to keep working there then here what i would do. go to your boss immediately get ahead of whatever this person threat is about tell them that whatever this girl says is a lie.
