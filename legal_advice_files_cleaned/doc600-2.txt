i bought dollars worth of christmas presents. dhl said they delivered the package to me and got a signature at : pm. not only is the signature wrong its just a big x but i have video cameras in the front and back of my house. the delivery driver never came by! they opened up a trace on the package and their conclusion is hey delivered it to me at : pm and the driver got a signature from a lady and consider the matter closed'. either the delivery driver stole my package or dhl delivered to the wrong house and does not care to investigate any further. i recorded all my calls with them. can i take them to small claims court with the customer service recordings my security camera footage and sue them for the cost of my package + any legal fees? your recourse is with the vendor you bought the gifts from. you have a contract with dhl they do. it the vendor job to make sure your order gets to you. contact them and ask how to proceed.
