yesterday i wrote what happened to one of my housemate. long story short : he was sent to detention center and bail was 100k cash only. nobody knows where he is whether he is released now and all but furniture was taken by cops then i found why he was taken with search warrant. prostitution. yes i am not joking. another mate found that from local arrest log. how could it be possible here prostitution is misdemeanor but 100k cash only bail and search warrant operated by a lot of big police guys bail is set by the type of charges he incurred the amount of danger he posses to society and if they think he a flight risk. a 100k cash bail says he committed very serious offenses and that the judge believes he is dangerous and or a flight risk. as for: i think such ugly man sorry but it is true. he is a chubby guy with early hair loss symptom could be a pimp. what kind of women will voluntarily give all money that matter. he could be 400 pounds no hair on his head and a jungle on his back and still be a pimp. stereotypes are bad even when they are about allegedly bad people. you added you location op. 100k cash only bail leads me to believe he was involved in more than simple prostitution. like human trafficking or child stuff. edit for your edit i think such ugly man sorry but it is true. he is a chubby guy with early hair loss symptom could be a pimp. what kind of women will voluntarily give all money you really know much about prostitution pimping and human trafficking do you the appearance of anyone other than the person forced to have sex for money really matter.
