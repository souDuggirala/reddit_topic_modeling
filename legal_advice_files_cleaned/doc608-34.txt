i have been working in this pharmacy for 2 years and these past six months i have been working more but my check just seems to barely increase. i am the main tech there i get paid 13 hour we get paid monthly. these past two months i worked 65 plus hours but was payed 454.65. i live in cook county illinois. i just wanted to make sure that i was blowing this out of proportions. your pay stubs should come with a full breakdown of what is being deducted from your paycheck; at 13 per hour working 65 hours should make you start at around $845 for that paycheck before any deductions. after that will be federal income social security and medicaid taxes and then state income tax possibly; know if illinois has state income tax then potentially a 401k employer health insurance or any other benefits that you partly pay for through payroll deductions. i do different work in a different state and am at a higher tax bracket but my take home after all is said and done usually works out to ~60% of my pre tax income so it may be a bit low here for you but that could be for any number of reasons so without knowing more i say if he deducting too much. thank you for the advice i am getting payed 2maro hope its close to what the psycheckcity estimated op you need to review your pay stub and see what your gross pay is and then the deductions being made from it. going to have any idea if being paid legally or not. run your own calculations on paycheckcity. link
