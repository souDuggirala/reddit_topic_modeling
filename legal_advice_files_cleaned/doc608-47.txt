i work doing demolition. i was sent to a job site today that has the ceiling positive for asbestos falling down and positive drywall on the floor. i was asked to sweep it all up. once i notified my boss he had me leave immediately. however the project manager was the one who wants us to continue. i am no certified to remove asbestos and did not know nor was told the job was positive when i was sent out. from what i understand we are allowed to enter the building as it is but not supposed to disturb any material. every other project manager has had us do nothing until it is abated in a similar situation. iâ€™m not sure exactly what my recourse is. i feel like this has to be an osha violation of some kind. not sure how to approach it again with the higher ups. any advice would be appreciated. well the good news is a single exposure to asbestos going to raise your risk of cancer. if the building was certified to be safe to enter and to work in you should be fine. asbestos is dangerous under very specific circumstances and over long periods of times. if the building been certified safe to enter or if you believe you are being exposed you can contact your state osha collaborator oregon occupational safety and health division .
