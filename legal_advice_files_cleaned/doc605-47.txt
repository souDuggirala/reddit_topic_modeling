so earlier this year i had planned to start a business on my own. i went through the process of creating my own delaware c corp got a federal ein etc. however life happened and i unfortunately decided to stay with my current job instead of starting my own business. now like to go through the process of dissolving this business. #x200b; \ since i actually conducted any business beyond just registering it do i still need to file a final irs tax return \ what form do i need to dissolve a delaware c corp \ anything else i should be aware of #x200b; probably the simplest way to close out a never active and least expensive is to request the ra to resign. doing it the direct way through the division of corporations requires filing a form and completing any annual returns that are due. there are multiple forms and fees involved. it is not clear to me which form is appropriate in your situation. i suggest reaching out to the doc for advice. first you file a certificate of dissolution in delaware. if sole proprietorship this is easy. once that been received you tell the irs you are dissolving and let you know any due taxes. then you can close up any bank accounts or credits cards and done. that it.
