i know my google fu must be off today because i cannot find exactly what steps must be taken to legally sell an old truck i have as a "parts vehicle". the buyer is a dude that rang my doorbell asking about it. he a scrapyard owner just wants it for parts for his truck he uses in pulling competitions. anyone ever deal with a similar situation in pennsylvania if so what steps did you take as far as the title and whatnot goes apologies for the very lame question that i should be able to figure out myself! good advice! much appreciated and many thanks. you should be able to just cancel or transfer if you have a replacement vehicle the registration on it remove the plates and sell it by signing over its existing title. if you want it is possible to apply for a salvage title for the vehicle but its not necessary as long as you have a title already. being for parts it really matter unless he tries to register it which you generally do to a parts vehicle . while used vehicles are generally as is unless otherwise indicated also suggest you provide a bill of sale listing the vehicle as being "sold as is non running for parts only". make a second copy of the bill of sale for yourself and have him sign it that way he turn around and try to claim you sold him a lemon. i read your comment too fast. thought you were asking from what state the title was from. the title is for a fully functioning vehicle. however it has sat and rusted to hell the last two years. no chance it could be passed for inspection and repairs would be thousands upon thousands. pa. title. nonrepariable what is the state of the title right now is it salvage or nonrepairable
