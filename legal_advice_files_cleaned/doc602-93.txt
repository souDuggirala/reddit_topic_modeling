iâ€™m in california and i rent a 3 bedroom apartment with two subtenants who have stopped paying rent. if i stop paying my rent because of this i know my landlord has to sue all three of us. but will all three of us be responsible for the unpaid rent or just me only me and my former roommate who moved out before i got these subtenants. who is in the actual lease with the landlord but read in multiple places that my landlord can only evict all three of us not just me. is this not true unless your landlord has a lease with the other two people getting sued not then. be responsible for the unpaid rent not them. you are the landlord for your subtenants. therefore you are wholly responsible for the amount listed in your lease and your subtenants are responsible for the amount in their lease. if you stop paying your ll they can and will sue you for the entire amount of your lease. then have to sue your sub lessors for the amount they owe you for their lease. just you. know my landlord has to sue all three of us no. your landlord has no contract with the people you subbed to. you could sue them. but you owe the full amount to your landlord no matter what.
