no idea if this is the right tag but it seems the most fitting. i am in ontario canada. i signed a contract for a gym terms were 1 year before canceling is accepted. 2 years later i figured i would cancel my membership since work supplies me with a free gym. i made a call in september 2017 to cancel my membership and was told that my membership would be cancelled and i would see one last final charge on my card. fast forward to may 2018 i was still being charged however didnt really bother to deal with it. i was going to be away for work i am military and would be away for 6 months so on may 8th 2018 i called and attempted to cancel again. i had emailed as well as called many times to leave messages. on te 20th of may my call finally got through to someone i was ensured that it would be cancelled. the following months i was still being charged however did not have access to my phone due to work. on october 14th i had called and emailed to follow up and figure out why my situation is not being sorted out. many emails and voicemails none being returned. i made a post about this a while back and got the advice to call my bank and seize payments as well as refund previous ones up to 3 months. i did this and they refunded me 45$ each month for 3 months. totaling roughly 150$ a few days ago i received an email stating that a 400$ claim has been sent to collections from my gym. i dont know if this matters at all but my gym is part of a franchise so is owned and operated by a franchisee. i am tired of fighting this and trying to figure this out. this has added unneeded stress and will start to affect my career if i proceed to take this to course. i will not be allowed to have any form of career progression until this is sorted out if in court. before i proceed to meet with a local lawyer i figured i would see what people on here think. i do not want to waste a lawyers time if i have no ground for any action here.
