friend of mine got caught with weed but the cops gave this ticket for smoking in public area. i am wondering if they should get a lawyer. how bad is it it requires in person court appearance. should they need a lawyer how is the punishment was this person ticked for obstruction of highways or for smoking in public or both anyone facing a charge on a drug related offense should likely seek counsel. often there is an outcome possible that avoids conviction on a drug charge. that is always advantageous. it so much the punishment for the offense which is often relatively small but the criminal record that now includes a drug conviction. your friend should seek a consultation with a lawyer.
