i'm something of a hobbyist last year around new years i had a whole lot of fun in regards to fireworks with all my friends. this year i got the idea to make a sort of "firework launcher" which would resemble a large pistol made out of wood and cardboard. i got the idea after seeing the 37 38mm flare guns. these are large bore devices that are specifically exempt from the destructive device designation. however these devices have a bore diameter exceeding .5 inch. the launcher i want to make will be less than that. since you rifle cardboard and it will have a short barrel length i was worried this might be considered an aow since flare launchers are as far as my research has taken me only specifically exempt from the destructive device designation. i could increase the caliber but i like the size it is right now and want to change it if at all possible. the thing i want to make will actually be a pretty tame and any anti personnel usage will be impossible but you can never be too sure. thanks for the advise! and about the launcher itself the propellant charge will be very small and the the actual projectile will be similar to a shortened bottle rocket. not saying your wrong if rolled paper tubes hold the pressure ill be sure to use something else. fireworks are non weapon explosive ordnance so they are exempt from the nfa. keep in mind something made of cardboard probably work and need to build something that can withstand the pressure of that you might be in the clear legally but having fireworks explode 5 feet from you is ill advised.
