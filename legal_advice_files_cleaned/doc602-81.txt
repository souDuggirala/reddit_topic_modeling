i received a citation today for an expired registration on my vehicle that has been out since . the car sat for months so today i woke up to jump start the vehicle so i could drive around miles to reset codes so i could have the vehicle inspected. coincidentally i received a citation for the expired registration while driving to reset the codes. my original plan was if the vehicle passed either sell it or donate the vehicle; or if the vehicle failed i would donate the vehicle. the car did fail the inspection and at this point i'm ready to go ahead donate the vehicle to . however i now have a citation stuck in between me and the donation option i need the best guidance on how to handle this. i contacted to ask what paperwork i would receive upon donation and was told a "pick up receipt" and once the vehicle is finally sold i will receive an e mail that the vehicle is sold. next contacted the municipal court to ask if i went the donation route what paperwork they would accept to help dismiss the ticket. the representative stated to set a court date and speak with the prosecutor and obtain any and all paperwork that may help dismiss the ticket to my name. what does suggest? thanks pay the fine.
