i will try to keep this as concise as possible. basically one of my friends recently became seriously ill to the point of incapacitation and my understanding is that he lease has been terminated or is void due to he disability; however two of my other friends are still living there. all three people signed the lease agreement initially. are they now responsible for that remaining share of the rent is it their responsibility to find a new tenant or is it the landlord responsibility in va. thanks in advance. were the other 2 tenants on separate leases or was this all 1 lease if your friend pay their share of the rent the remaining roommates can sue them for the money. i cannot find any virginia law that says a lease is void due to disability. that tenant is still responsible for the rent unless you and them came to an agreement releasing them from the lease va law does state though the landlord must make a reasonable effort to find a new tenant when a lease is broken for non justifiable reasons. the only way to change people on a lease is to have all the signatories agree to the modification. this would mean all three people on the lease and the landlord. they have to create a new agreement. no one can just drop people off a lease without everyone being in agreement. if there was no new agreement then your friend who has the illness is still responsible for their portion of rent as per the lease. the lease almost certainly makes the tenants all joint and severally liable for rent which means the others need to pay the rent in full if one roommate pay their share.
