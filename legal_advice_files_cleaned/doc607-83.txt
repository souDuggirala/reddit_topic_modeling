hi everyone! try to keep it short! basically my roommate dog got stung by a bee. we moved into our townhome in a community of townhomes in august. the townhome next to ours had a beehive growing in their wall. about a month ago my roommate dog stepped on one of the bees and had to go to the er before going into anaphylactic shock. she had to stay over night and the whole thing cost them around $900. the morning after my roommates went to go talk to our neighbors and they said tried to contact their landlord hoa since summer but they fixed it. i think my roommate got the email of their landlord and a day later someone came to fix it. if the landlord hoa was actually being negligent until an accident occurred is there anything we can do about it the dog lives there legally pet deposit and everything thank you for reading this post! same result. sorry. it was our neighbors landlord that was contacted not ours if the landlord hoa was actually being negligent until an accident occurred there no negligence in the facts you gave us. a landlord have a duty to make the premises bee proof nor does he have a duty to remediate a bee infestation on someone else property. is there anything we can do about it no. sorry.
