so i sold an iphone x to someone for and i shipped it to them. they said they paid it was just processing the payment through paypal. but i yet to recieve payment after hours. they said they would send me bank statements saying the payment went through but they have neglected to send to them to me and now are ignoring me. is this fraud or scamming? what can i do about this. i really serious. but when i go to the store iâ€™m leaving with the item in hand. i was just making a point that buye could potentially get scammed. so when you order from a retailer online you pay until they ship your product? they ship your product until the payment is processed. also paypal always favors the buyer the seller if shipping the product before receiving payment is literally just sending free product because there is nothing to guarantee the buyer will pay. why should they? product has been shipped. when you go to the store does your receipt print before or after your payment is processed? yup been scammed. i showed paypal this and they said it was fraud. that pretty much your answer then. can you put for the package to be turned around if it been delivered yet ? if it has been delivered need to sue the person. next time send anything until the money is confirmed in your account. this screams fraud to me. paypal had said this looks to appear like fraud because she doesnt have the funds to pay for it. i requested and she sent what appears to be a reciept of of her sending the money but it says pending. i showed paypal this and they said it was fraud. do you see this payment anywhere on your paypal or are you just taking their word for it?
