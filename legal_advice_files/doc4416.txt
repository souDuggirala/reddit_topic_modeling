 My isp (Telus Canada) sent me an email stating that I downloaded deadpool 2 illegally or what not.... just wondering what I should do as I downloaded 5 movies. I deleted the app I used (coho movie) and deleted the movies. Don't listen to them too many people do it, they just send the letters to scare you shhh. Think about it they can't sue us all. If they could why would they send letters. Profit is theft, keep pirating. Never blindly follow authority. Same thing happened to my older brother I was just told. Both emails were for downloading deadpool 2 lol  This happened to me as well. Turns out my roommate was the culprit, but since the internet account was under my name and email, the email came to me. I informed him of the flag, and we’ve been all good since. It’s a very common automated notice so I wouldn’t worry about it, unless you’re downloading a high volume of pirated content. ISPs send these notices when the copyright holder informs the ISPs that one of their IPs are illegally downloading copyrighted content. You’ve done all the proper steps though. You live and learn. Alright sounds good. Thank you As /u/swalsh411 said, just stop pirating stuff and move along. These are automated systems that either set up honeypots or sniff traffic for known downloads. If you continue to pirate they reserve the right to terminate your internet service, I doubt your parents would be very happy about that. ~~stop illegally downloading movies~~ Stealing intellectual property. FTFY  Yea It’s the first time i ever did it. So I deleted everything and won’t do so again. You should stop illegally downloading movies and hope you don't get sued.
