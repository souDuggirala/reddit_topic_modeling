A year and a half ago there was a fire in the oven at the home we were renting in Ontario. We were using it to melt wax in a metal pot. There was about 15.000 in damages partly because the firefighters poured multiple pounds of liquid wax down the sink. The oven was wrecked as well. When I first got a notice from the insurance a year ago, I left a voicemail saying it was unclear what exactly caused the fire, and I do not accept liability. No reply, and over a year later they said if we don't pay them they will file legal action in 10 days. They said we did not reply to a letter from June 1st, which none of us received. ( we all now live somewhere else) 

I left another voicemail today saying again I do not see how I am liable. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
