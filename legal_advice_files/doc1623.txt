 Hello Legal Advice, I'm planning to self-publish my Amazon product. In short, it's a deck of cards, and each card is going to be one famous person (like Tony Robbins, Simon Sinek, etc.) On each card is a quote from them, a description about their life, and a cartoon illustrator. I will also include a booklet that lists each person's bio and description, and where they can find them on the internet (website, social media links). I am wondering if this is sufficient enough, as long as I include their links of the work and make it obvious that some of the content are direct quotes from them. OR do I need to individually ASK each person and get permission from them that I'm writing a book about them? I don't want to get sued. Thank you!
