 Hi So I received notification of a debt in early December. Disputed it within 30 days. On Tuesday, 1/22 the collection agency left me a voicemail attempting to collect the debt Of course I’m shocked because I have yet to recieve the proof of the debt. I call them to ask where it is, the collector says “oh we sent it today” It finally gets to me a few days later with a postmark date of 1/23 but a document created date on their proof page of 1/22. Does the fdcpa go off of postmark for considering when I’m “sent” the proof of the debt? Or the date they put on the document? They sent it regular mail, no return receipt or anything so it just showed up in my mailbox a few days later Thanks in advance Wonderful. I appreciate your response. Was kinda leaning that way anyways but wanted to bounce it off someone to make sure I wasn’t being irrational before the consult lol thanks Considering the amount of the debt and if it is still within the SOL, they might offer a mutual walkaway. I would get a consultation with a consumer attorney. Judges don’t have to award the full $1000 for a violation. An attorney might be able to give you some insight on your best options.  Just a smidge over $1k Technically, they probably violated the FDCPA. However, how this would play out if you were to file suit is unknown. If you don’t mind my asking, how much is the debt?
