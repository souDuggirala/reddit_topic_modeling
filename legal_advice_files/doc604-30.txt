I made a t-shirt design in Photoshop and posted in r/brooklynninenine. Someone used the design without my permission and sell it on shirts (made about 680$ so far)
Can I do something about it? I tried to contact him and he ignored my messages This is a mess.  So you stole [/u/hello_luigi's artwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/brooklynninenine/comments/a2nldx/celebrating_the_new_season_with_my_take_on_the/), took a few minutes to rearrange it and slap it onto a t-shirt design, and then someone else steals *that* and sells the t-shirts.  And meanwhile, the entire affair is trademark violation of the TV Show.

You have no legal recourse here. No, you cannot do anything. 

If you want to give them a scare and maybe have them stop, google a template for a Cease and Desist order.

Email/mail them a cease and desist letter stating that they do not have permission to use the photo and you will pursue legal action if they continue to do so.

Youâ€™d spend more on legal fees pursuing this case than you would receive if you won. Sorry. Next time use a watermark.  [removed]
