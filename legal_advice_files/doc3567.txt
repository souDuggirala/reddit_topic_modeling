 Hi All, I was a W-2 contractor for a company in New York, on assignment with a hospital in Indiana (not sure how much that part matters). My last day of employment was November 16, and I was told they were holding my paycheck until I returned the laptop, which I did the following Tuesday, November 20. I still haven’t received my paycheck at my old or new address, and have been reaching out to the consulting firm. I quit, and they weren’t too happy about me leaving, so I sense some animosity there. Now, a full month later, they are contesting the hours I worked my last week. What can I do?
