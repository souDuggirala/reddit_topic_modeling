 So, before the judging eyes start a-judgin' - consensual non-consent (aka rape play) is a thing. I don't know why every girl I meet is into this but it's been the last four girlfriends now who want me to "make it as realistic as possible." Yeah, I don't get it either, but I'm actually into it too so I guess I have no room to talk. There has been a common theme of daddy issues if anyone was wondering. So, I always use a safe word to make sure at any moment if she's uncomfortable or otherwise wants things to stop she can. I've heard of trials where she claims she forgot the safe word. And, in general, how does this play out legally? I don't want to get into a situation where I'm framed for rape when it was just a BDSM play. Does she need to give some form of written consent? I'm wealthy and have an important career so it's possible that someone would have a motive to frame me. Advice would be strongly appreciated to have a little prevention in this department. Thanks in advance.
