 Maybe this isn’t the right place but I am getting extremely frustrated and worried about my information being out in the open. Ever since January 2016, a woman named Denise in the Midwest has been using my email address as a burner. I constantly get her Macy’s credit card statements, obviously I can’t login since I don’t have the password. Every time I call Macy’s they literally don’t understand that “I can’t login to change the email address because I didn’t create the account, how would I know the password”. Now she’s signed up for some MLM vitamin-mailer shit. Is there any legal protection from people like this? It seems like there is literally nothing I can do to prevent this woman from providing my email address as a burner one. I know my “personally identifiable information” isn’t necessarily at risk it is just an email address, but I still do not want to be associated with any of these companies / even more so don’t want a credit card I have never seen to be linked to my email. Thank you both! I guess my dilemma is that I don’t really want to take any action in terms of “accessing her account”..... I know this makes me sound like I should be over on Choosing Beggars lol. Just worried if I were to reset “her” password, gain access to “her” personal information, etc. then I would be the one at legal risk..... she has to submit her SSID to open the credit card I’m assuming, and I feel like that’s a can of worms I’d be opening if I start changing things in “her” account. Delete your email and get a new one 🤷🏼‍♂️ Oh. I didn't even think of that. Brilliant! You could take it one step further and possibly discover the address of the person using your email if they had any online orders. This is not guaranteed to be the person because they may be using additional stolen identities. I'm not sure this would work, but it might be worth a try if you haven't already tried it. Could you go to the log-in page, enter your email address and then click "forgot password'? After you took the steps to change the password, you might be able to log in and change the email associated with the account. You'd probably have to make your own burner email address and use that, since they usually confirm email address changes via the new email address. Hope that makes sense. I know that doesn't answer your question about the legalities about the situation but it might help with the annoyance part of your dilemma.
