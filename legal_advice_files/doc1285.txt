 I am a student living in Vancouver. I have been renting out a house since May with a group of friends. We were just contacted about our landlord about renewing our lease. He wants to make some changes to our lease that I do not think are legal but am struggling to find clear information online about that isn't full of legal jargon. He has requested more than double the rent we currently pay for any months we wish to sublet during the summer. As I am not from Vancouver and plan to go home for the summer, this is not affordable for me at all. I am not sure if this is legal and am looking for some advice on what to do next if it is not. This landlord was also refusing to fix a broken toilet in this house and I have been paying for repairs out of pocket. I found online that he needs to reimburse me/other tenants for this but I am again not sure how to go about this as this is my first time renting. Any additional help on this would also be great. Thanks all!  Your landlord cannot compel you to agree to any changes to your current lease. Your lease automatically renews on the same terms; no need to do anything. Also, you are right that he is responsible for maintenance and he should reimburse you. You can make an application at the BC Residential Tenancy Board for an order for reimbursement.
