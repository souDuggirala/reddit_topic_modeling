 This is a dark place to go with my thoughts, and a strange place to come for comfort, but I'm at a loss. I laid awake with worry all last night and this morning got news of a friend in a coma, who isn't going to survive it. My mom hasn't talked to me since an argument we had in July, hasn't responded to calls or texts, and I am starting to worry. She has cut herself off from her family steadily over the years, and now me it seems. I don't know anyone in her life who I can ask if she's okay. I live 2000 miles away. How would people reach me if anything happened? If she were hospitalized, would anyone call me? What is the process? Who does what when seeking relatives, and how do they get that information? What are my rights as her daughter?  No worries! Thank you. Only thing that makes me feel better is knowing they're in a better place. I'm so sorry about your friend and what's going on with your mom. It may seem impossible but I really hope things get better. hugs  Thank you for sharing your experiences. My heart goes out to you over these traumatic deaths.  Do you know her address or where she works? You could request a wellness check if you know her address. If she works, call and ask for her by first name. It depends. Usually people list someone as their next of kin in paperwork for doctors or schools etc. and that how authorities know who to contact. If there is no next of kin or they cant find the info, they'll just try to find an much info as possible with whatever identification they have. When my uncle was murdered he was like 2 hrs away from my home and didnt have a next of kin. They found letters I wrote to him as a child and pictures of my siblings and I and somehow theyfound us through our local PD and came to our door to let us know. When my aunt committed suicide, they found her and notified her husband who was her next of kin. It helped that he reported her missing before they found her so it was easy to get a hold of him.
