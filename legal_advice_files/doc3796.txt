 I live and work in the UK and at the start of this year I was granted 30 days holiday (I had two moved from last year). At time of writing I currently have 15 remaining and I don't think I'll be able to take them off before the end of the year... Is my employer legally allowed to just have them evaporate or is he required to pay me for them, since moving 3 weeks is a ridiculous thing to do.  I will add that if you were allowed to carry forward days last year they may have a policy allowing you to carry some forward this year. Ask and see. I'll remember that next time, I have my answer now but thanks.  Damn it. Thank you.  The laws are so different in the UK, r/legaladviceuk would be best for you Good luck!  They are under no obligation to let you carry forward holidays you've chosen not to take and they don't have to pay you for holidays not taken either. with certain exceptions of you being on maternity leave or signed off sick long-term which don't appear to apply here.
