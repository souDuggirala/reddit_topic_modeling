Not me, but a co-worker.

At work we have a break room with a passcode that only employees and managers know. Earlier this month, a co-worker had about 10 one dollar bills stolen from their locker. All the employees working that day have worked there for a while and have a trustworthy reputation. However, one employee who was hired a few days prior to this incident was seen going into the break room (off the clock), and wasn't seen coming out until 10 minutes later. Then, they bought something with 10 one dollar bills. A manager was present during the exchange. Most of the managers agree that it is likely this new hire. However, because the victim did not have a lock on their locker (and there is a paper on the break room wall stating that they are not liable for stolen property if there isn't a lock) they claim that they can't do anything

&amp;#x200B;

Then, a few days ago, the same employee had $11 stolen. There were 4 employees working that day, one of which is the suspected employee. This time, the victim had a lock on their locker, but the thief bent the locker open.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, a disclaimer. This is all reported by the victim. I was working at the time the first incident happened, and their story lines up with what I witnessed. However, something that I find odd is that the victim used different lockers, and they are the only ones to have something stolen. There are no identifying characteristics on the outside of the lockers.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, there are no cameras inside the break room, so we don't have concrete evidence, but we think the evidence for the first incident is very strong.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, is the company liable because the victim had a lock on their locker, and the paper implies that they are liable if you have a lock? And what recourse can this employee take? Also, what can I as an employee do to protect myself? Can I recommend cameras in the break room to the company in order to deter theft, or are there laws against that? You can protect yourself by not bringing valuables to work.  First if something is stolen make a police report. Dont assume your work can replace that.

&amp;#x200B;

Following that ask your company to reimburse for the second theft based on their sign wording. 

&amp;#x200B;

What can employees do? Stop putting stuff in lockers.

Can you recommend cameras, sure you can recommend them and they are likely legal but the company has no obligation to install them. The person *most directly* responsible for the theft is the thief.

The company *might* share some liability if guarantees of security were made or liability was explicitly taken in certain situations.  I'm not sure that has happened, so the actual thief should be considered first and foremost.

Theft is a crime, meaning law enforcement would be the appropriate authorities to report to.

Cameras in the break room are probably not illegal.  Some situations may make their use at certain times illegal (such as if the break room door has a lock and, perhaps, an employee with a child is using the room to breastfeed).
