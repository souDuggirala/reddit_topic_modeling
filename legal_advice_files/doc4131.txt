 I don’t really have an option in this case, I just want to make sure legally I would be ok. I’m also going to be courteous to my neighbors who always park on the side of the street and ask them as well.  Yeah, I'm on the board of mine, and don't think any member would have a problem with one of those things, so long as it's not there for a stupid amount of time (more than a couple weeks) In many locations the ability to leave something other than a car on the street is controlled by local ordinance. You should check with your local city and/or county as well. In my location you would need a permit from the city to do so. Have you reached out to the HOA and asked them? Despite the horror stories you read about, many HOAs are run by perfectly reasonable people. If you give them a heads up ("Hey, going to have a POD outside my house for 3 days, just wanted to let you all know.), they may not have a problem with it.
