 In 1984 him and his wife moved into a house that was owned by the wife's parents. After they were married for 20 years in 2004 the parents signed the house over to them. From 2004 to 2016 my fried and his wife had a mortgage on the house but he was the only source of income so he was making all of the payments. In 2015 they separated but they did not officially divorce or file for separation he just moved elsewhere. From 2015 to 2017 he was still paying the mortgage and all the bills even though he wasn't living there anymore. After he moved out the wife and her family kept pressuring him to sign the house over to the wife. My friend said he checked with someone that if he signed the house over to the wife through quick deeds he would still have rights to the property if they officially got divorced since it's a community property state and he had lived there for 30 years. So now that my friend is filing for divorce he wants to know if he still has a right to the property. He needs to run all of this by a family law attorney to get an accurate answer.  Did he quitclaim the property back to the wife? If so and if she was smart and only supported the property with separate property (or a family member supported it) it is incredibly possible that he's entitled to absolutely no portion of the house. This is a great example of why you speak to attorneys before ringing bells.
