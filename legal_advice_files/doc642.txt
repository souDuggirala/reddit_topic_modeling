 Works for a large grocery store chain, and is a cashier. He's received a lot of performance based raises/other acclaim and had plans on moving up in the company, but this one incident could hurt that. Is there anything that can be done to fight this?  Fight what? This isn't a legal issue. They're free to record that this incident took place, even if it was inadvertent and not meant to offend.
