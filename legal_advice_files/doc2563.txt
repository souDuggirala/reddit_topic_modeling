 Basically (and I hope this is the right place to post) my bank sent me a message about a $16.37 charge to a trucking company in another state that definitely wasn’t me. I called them to report the fraud and as I was speaking to the agent she informed there was also a $5000 charge made to Bloomingdales. They reversed the charges and stopped the card, but can I trust them to investigate? Since my dad died two years ago I have been helping to support my mom and I couldn’t handle if this charge had gone through so I want to make sure I find out how this happened to avoid it ever happening again in the future. This actually happened once before where someone purchased a ticket to Turkey but when we spoke to the bank they said they wouldn’t reverse the charge because it fit with our pattern of spending... which it didn’t. So my question is, can I investigate this and how? Thanks in advance for any and all help you all can provide!  You are a $2000 charge for a flight to turkey? Thanks! Just hate this helpless feeling. Does the bank not look into where the order was meant to be delivered? I would if I could but I guess they would never give me any of the necessary information. If the charges were handled by your card issuer and you suffered no loss in the event, you likely have no standing to take any other action in the matter. You're whole and the matter is concluded as it relates to you. If your card issuer hasn't canceled your card and reissued one with a new number, you should ask that they do so.
