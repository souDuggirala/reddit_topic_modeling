 Hi all. In the summer (August) I was driving back to Chicago from Boston and had to drive through the state of New York. I was pulled over for going 85 in a 60 and in addition, I had a taillight not working. I completely forgot about those two tickets and received recently a note in the mail that read “STATE OF NEW YORK NONRESIDENT VIOLATORS COMPACT NOTICE OF FAILURE TO COMPLY” If I do not respond by 01/06/18, my license will be suspended. I of course plan on replying and would not mind paying the tickets, however, the taillight since then has been fixed so I was wondering if that can stay off. In addition, I have two choices on this form, Plead Guilty or Plead not Guilty. Is there still an option to pay the ticket but get it off my record, such as traffic school or deferral? I also would like not to show up to New York for court for a speeding ticket as Illinois isn’t quite close. Okay, you were speeding 25 OVER with vital lighting out, and you skipped court. You seem to think this is nowhere near as big of a deal as it is. You will not be able to take some class and have it off your record entirely, no. You should seriously consider speaking to a traffic attorney about how to proceed.
