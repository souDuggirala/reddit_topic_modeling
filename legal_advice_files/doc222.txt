 Hi. As mentioned in the title, the property beneath me has reported water in her ceiling the developer has told her to contact the flat above (me). My flat is only two years old and the shower was installed and siliconed by the builders themselves. So surely this should be down to the builders? Some further details - I had my flooring replaced a month ago due to a leak the builders caused when damaging the roof of the whole building (they are building penthouses at the moment), which the flat below mine also has water damage from. Am I right in thinking that they should take responsibility for not sealing the bathroom properly, or I take responsibility due to the fact they have admitted water damage already due to damaging the building structure? Apologies if this is a tad confusing, Iâ€™m not the best at explaining via text. Thank you, Scooby.
