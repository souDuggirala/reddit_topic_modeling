 Hey All, I recently got into a minor fender bender, entirely my fault, as a i rear ended the person in front of me at a yield sign. I was driving a large truck with a deer guard, and the other person, a smaller car. There is very minor damage to my deer guard, in which I have little interest in paying to have fixed, atleast for right now. Their car has obvious damage, and might even exceed my deductible. This happened 7 days ago, and to my knowledge, no claim has been filed. I dont plan on filing any claim, so the ball is in their court. I live in Texas, and did some research, and it looks like there is a state wide 10 day car accident report deadline? There is no personal injury, and no destruction of property other than the vehicles. Does this mean after 10 days, if the other party does not file a claim with their insurance, the claim will be dismissed if they plan on filing in the future? Will there be any backfire if i choose not to file a claim, and instead just wait on them? Oh wow, I thought id have to pay the deductible. Then does that deductible only apply for fixing damage on my own vehicle? (Full coverage insurance) Your insurance should cover all of a liability claim up to the policy limits.  's no deductible on liability claims. Sorry but what exactly does this mean? That i would not have to pay any money out of pocket, that my insurance would cover? Or that Id have to pay ALL of it out of pocket?  There's no deductible on liability claims. Are you talking about policy limits? Their failure to file an accident report probably does not change your liability in the accident. It appears the applicable statute of limitations is two years.
