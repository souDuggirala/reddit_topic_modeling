 So I take Klonopin Prozac, I have been on these meds for 5 years. The beginning of November I had an appointment with my psychiatrist as I do normally once a month, Anyway the secretary calls me and tells me I need to reschedule because he wouldn’t be back in the country until December 7th, at this point I will be going a month without my medicine so I’m a little worried. I asked the secretary if she can call my doctor okay my new script due to it not being my fault having to reschedule, she tells me he won’t do that. So now December 8th rolls around (my new appointment) and she calls me to reschedule again because he’s having emergency surgery (again won’t okay my new prescription) at this point a little over a month with out I’m sick and withdrawing. Throwing up, dizziness, fever, diarrhea etc. Now, I have finally been able to see my doctor yesterday 12/19 and I told him not only has it been hard with out my medicine for over a month but I have been sick with withdrawals (at this point I’m angry) my doctor looks at me surprised!! He had no idea I’ve been without for so long, he gave the secretary permission to call in my meds she never did that as well as telling me the doctor said no! Is this legal for a secretary to with hold medicine from a patient? Is there anything I can do if she is not fired?
