 A tenant after moving out emailed me and said that he had a roommate (who wasn't on the lease) and his roommate owes the last months rent. Then he gave me the roommate's info. My thought is to proceed legally somehow (in Texas) and give the tenant one last time to pay before I file legal paperwork. But how do I file asking for back rent? I don't know how to start going about this.  No security deposit? You have to go after the tenant. If you sue the roommate you will lose, because the roommate never had a contractual relationship with you, only with your tenant. You can sue him. You can get a lawyer or not. If doing it without a lawyer, use small claims court if possible. If using a lawyer you can request that your legal fees be included in the judgment (though you will have to pay lawyer up front). You should make sure roommate is leaving the unit or start an eviction immediately.  You need to tell him that since the roommate wasn’t on the lease, you are not legally able to go after the roommate for the rent. He can make the roommate pay, or you’ll be taking him to court. Do not contact the roommate at all, as doing so may be interpreted as your agreement to transfer the debt to the roommate.  You can sue for any unpaid rent up until the statute of limitations for written contracts in your location which is years.
