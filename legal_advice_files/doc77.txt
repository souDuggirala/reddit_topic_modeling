 I don't think how or why the relationship ended matters with stuff like this. As far as I know, New Jersey law is on my side but I'm not quite sure about Tennessee. What exactly happens if she doesn't comply? I'm very uninformed on all of this unfortunately. She also threatened to sell it but I'm not quite sure if she did. However, if that's the case, am I entitled to the money then or no? I'm normally not this petty but I saved up a good amount for the ring and I'm currently looking to get myself settled in a new place, so that money would be incredibly helpful for me. Sure. There's no legal issue with that. It may save you money. She'll then know your intentions, though, which is why you should make sure you can prove the value. I can do that without contacting a lawyer and then escalate it if need be? You'll pay whatever the lawyer's fee is for the time it takes to write the demand letter, so it'll likely cost something. I'd tell her that the law requires her to return the ring, and make sure you have proof of what the ring is worth in case she decides to sell it when you bring it up. I have no idea of the state of your relationship, but you should protect yourself as best you can. Does a demand letter cost anything? If so can I contact her and let her know my intentions just so I don't drag us both into the mud? Both NJ and TN consider an engagement ring a conditional gift. If the marriage does not take place the ring must be returned to the giver. You may have to sue to get it back, but she must return the ring or its value. Your best bet would be to have a TN lawyer send her a demand letter, and then if need be file suit in TN.  't comply? You can sue her for the fair market value of the ring.
