 Sorry for my english (I'm french) My father recently kicked me out the house. I live in Canada and I'm 19. He's going to work in the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) and one of the reasons he kicked me out is because I smoke weed once in a while since it's legal here now. Before he kicked me out he said he was going to use his RCMP's credentials to look at my transactions and the things I do on the internet. I think he was trying to scare me, but can he legally do that? He is a huge narcissist and liar and I still can't understand how he got accepted in the RCMP, since the tests are really hard and they do a background check (he used to take steroids and is an asshole). Any advice?  This is not legal, and probably not actually possible. While the technology exists to do these things, he wouldn't be able to do them himself and he would get fired for trying to get his colleagues to help him spy on his son. If you really want to fuck him over report his threats to these guys:  No, the police are not allowed to just willy nilly check into other peoples private information. That said it can and does happen. Larger question, who cares? If you are depending on your father for support, being an adult, then it seems fair you would abide by reasonable accommodation. If you arent relying on him for support, who cares if he knows you smoke legal weed? If it turns into harassment, like getting pulled over all the time for no reason or what not, you can file a complaint. Not only can he not legally do that, it would be almost impossible for him to do. Do you think any cop can check your internet history any time they want?
