 I live in Texas and got a job promotion but didn’t get a raise, 3 months later I got a raise but was told I wouldn’t be given back pay? Is this legal? Can I fight it at all? Or should I just look for a new job?  What would they be giving you back-pay for in October? Yeah, I was told “in October you’ll get a raise, and backpay” it’s December now lol Unless you have a contract or union agreement that says otherwise, you would not be entitled to back pay Promotions often go hand in hand with a raise, but they don't legally have to. It's legal to promote someone and not give them a raise. Were you promised a raise by a certain date and didn't receive that raise on that date or something? There is no legal right to a pay increase when one gets promoted. You are owed no back pay. Whether you want to look for a new job because your employer promoted you then gave you a raise three months later, that is up to you. But you were not wronged in any way.
