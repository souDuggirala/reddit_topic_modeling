  I was involved in a petty crime and got 3 misdemeanors. 2x 1st degree and 1x 3rd degree. I'm 19 and live in Philadelphia. I'm currently attending college. My lawyer told me he will try and dismiss all the charges and remove it from my record by speaking to the DA or whoever gives the charges. I was suppose to attend pre-trial this month but told by my lawyer that I no longer need to attend. Not because it was postponed. But next month I have to go to trial. Does anyone know what would occur on the upcoming court date? 1st court date I was told what my charges were. 2nd court date I was told my lawyer that I no longer need to go. What happens on the 3rd one? Sounds like a private meeting between your lawyer and prosecutor to discuss amending the charges. Dirt common procedure. Your lawyer knows best. If they say don’t show... then don’t show. They’ll keep you informed of what’s happening. Ask the attorney representing you Can't you ask your lawyer?
