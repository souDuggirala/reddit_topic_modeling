 As described in the title, I’m suing a business for ~$1500, and they have chosen to get a lawyer. The lawyer just sent out requests for the trial to follow civil rules and for the trial to have a jury. How do I deny those requests? Is there forms that I need to file? Going into the court on Monday to ask them. I’m hoping to avoid a formal trial because I don’t want to spend the money for a lawyer, looking to just keep this as small claims court case with a judges ruling as the final decision.  No. Civil claims in Alaskan courts follow the rules of civil procedure. The entire fact that small claims is an option in the first place is because of those rules. The advantage of small claims is that there is no real need to have a lawyer represent you. You won't be held to the rules of procedure and evidence, the court provides you with all the forms you need, and you have a lot more lattitude if you don't know and follow all the rules of civil procedure. Also, you don't have to pay a lawyer. I can't stress this enough: even if a defendent was confident of winning a lawsuit, they might end up paying as much or more in legal fees to hire a lawyer to defend themselves. Is there anyway to prevent civil rules? Seems like any small claims court case would just automatically become a civil case at the defendants request and then what is the point of the small claims process? Is there anyway to prevent civil rules? Seems like any small claims court case would just automatically become a civil case at the defendants request and then what is the point of the small claims process? You can’t. According to the [Alaska Rules for Civil Procedure]() proceeding in small claims court instead of civil court must be by mutual consent. If the defendant wants a jury trial and the formal rules of procedure in place, you aren’t able to deny them that right
