 My friend who lives in Texas is underage and drinks very strong alcohol. I’m very worried for her because she is diagnosed with depression and I don’t want her to do anything rash. I think her parents do allow her to drink, but I’m still worried if she could get in trouble. Should I do anything? If you're concerned for her, you can still talk with a trusted teacher or guidance councilor if you don't want to go straight to CPS. Especially if you are worried that she may harm herself, it's better to err on the side of caution. The national suicide prevention lifeline is 1-800-273-8255 in case either you or your friend needs to talk to someone. Ok thx so much! I didn’t know that so thx for informing me. Under 18 In TX, it is both legal for a parent/guardian to give alcohol to their minor children and for a minor child to drink alcohol provided by their parent/guardian so long as the parent is physically present while the child is drinking. Underage as in under 18 and legally a child, or over 18 and under 21 as in not legally allowed to drink? Child Protective Services. File a report and let them investigate, that's their job.
