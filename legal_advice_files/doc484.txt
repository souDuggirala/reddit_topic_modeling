 So I have two roommates, and the total rent is around 1650+utilities. The money funnels through me to pay the landlord and the utilities, leading my bank statements to have around $1000 a month of unidentified "income". Will any complications arise due to this?  Pretty sure I thought this is how everyone does it, no? Easiest and best way imo. It’s easily fixed when it’s asks  If you were audited, your banking records will show deposits and checks that are easily reconciled with your rental agreement. Ideally if your roommates pay with electronic transfers or paper checks, have them note the month and "rent" on each transfer. No, It's not considered income and is super easy to explain.
