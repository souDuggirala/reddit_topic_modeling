 My company's CEO sent out a memo informing us of an updated vacation policy effective 1/1/19. We are switching from an anniversary accrual year to a regular calendar accrual year. To "start this policy afresh" all vacation balances will zero out, unless otherwise mandated by state law. Is this legal?? Is there a state law saying that we are owed the money from our accrued vacation time? Understandably, everyone from our part-timers to upper management are angry and confused. Tomorrow we are having a meeting to discuss this new policy and I would appreciate any help or advice anyone has. Also, I'm taking a vacation in two weeks that I would not receive vacation pay for. Could I file a wage claim with the NJ Department of Labor for this? There is now way to fight this through the courts, as NJ does not have any laws that protect accumulated vacation time, so your best way to fight this is to either: A: Organize a strike or B: Mass-walk out Either way, you (and your co-workers) will probably want to write down how much vacation time you have built up prior to the change. (so that way if your strike works they can't pull a fast one on you) There is. Organize a strike. However much work you do or contribute to the company bottom line its never enough. They just want more time than you can give and will only give you the bare minimum in exchange. I'm so glad my working days are behind me. Times weren't perfect when we had unions but much better than today.  That's what I was afraid of. I saw that that was the case on the NJ Dept of Labor website but was hoping there was a loophole or some way we could all fight this (there's hundreds of us). Thanks for commenting; I appreciate it. I need to find a new job. Yes, in some states (like CA) it would be illegal to do this as vacation leave is treated as an earned benefit like wages. NJ does not require vacation leave of any kind and does not treat it as an earned wage or benefit. Itâ€™s shitty, but legal.
