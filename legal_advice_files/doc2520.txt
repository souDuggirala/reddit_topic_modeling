 I am currently 26. My mother just told me that my father tried twice to have me removed from my mother's household, but he didn't want me either. He wanted me to be put in Foster Care. Based on other elements of my mother's story, I think I was about 15 at the time. This was like a bomb dropped on me. I have had a very difficult relationship with both parents for as long as I can remember, but it has been slowly improving in recent years. I don't think I can ignore it like she never said it. I feel like I NEED to know if this is true or not. How does this work? Am I allowed to review court records about myself? Also potentially relevant information, this would have taken place in Connecticut roughly 2008 ish. I now live in Georgia. TLDR - How do I go about trying to view my own juvenile court records?
