 I suffer from a mental illness and was off work on disability for a while. My job was aware of this. Well a month later I started to slip again, coming in late, severe anxiety and breakdowns, and ultimately getting sick. I was in correspondence with my doctors constantly. Well I come back from work and was written up for calling out for work wrong. Well I got to work as usual and start to slip again and just can’t snap out of it. I’m late again and than after a few days I’m fired. They know I have a disability and that I haven’t been doing well but I am fired for the tardiness policy. I feel terrible about it but someone mentioned that they aren’t following the disability act labor laws. Is this true? Or am I just a shitty employee?  I'm afraid what you describe is not protected. You can ask for your work to make reasonable accommodations under the ADA, but coming in late and performing poorly are beyond the bounds of what you can ask. You could theoretically have some protection for unpaid sick leave under your state's labor laws or the FMLA, but you would need to follow proper procedure, giving them notice, providing documentation as needed, etc. Randomly showing up late isn't covered. Under the ADA you cannot be fired just for having a disability if you can do the job with or without a reasonable accommodation. However missing shifts and being late are not going to be a reasonable accommodation. So while it sucks for you, nothing here appears to be illegal.
