A friend of mine works in a bar as a karaoke host and on occasion I've recorded a few of the more eccentric characters singing on my phone. All recordings are audio only and I've never recorded names, personal conversations, or anything otherwise personally identifiable. This friend and I host a podcast together and we had discussed the possibility of playing some brief clips from the recordings and discussing them. We would never discuss anything identifiable.

Is it legal to do this? I know California is a two party consent state, but I feel like because the bar is a public place that would not apply.
