I’m currently a junior in high school they brought drug dogs to our parking lot and my truck got flagged out. They searched the truck and only found a bottle of vape juice and a pod for a suourin air they said they were gonna charge me with a Underage Tabacco charge 2 to be exact because I wouldn’t say where I got it from. Later that day they called me back into the office and said if I get into any trouble that could result in an any form of a charge I will be charged with the pervasive offense and one from a year before when they found a vape on me. Can they do that or are they just fronting help  location?
 Stop talking to the police.  Tell your parents you need to speak to a lawyer.
