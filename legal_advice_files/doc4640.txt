 I want to put some real estate into an llc. The property is in California. I don’t want anyone to find out that I own said property. Which state is the most beneficial for me to form the LLC in? Also would there be different benefits in having a multi member vs single member? You can’t lookup the owners of an LLC in Wyoming. New Mexico, and Nevada are also popular choices. A lot of factors, and different obligations to consider but I usually use Wyoming for real estate. Best to do your own research. None, since that isn't the point of a LLC. Speak to an asset protection lawyer because you can cause chaos by randomly transferring property.
