 Hi all. We have a two year old daughter that will require caregiver support for life. We are now starting to think about getting a special needs trust in place. There is a well known firm in my area that specializes in this, what should I expect to pay to have our own(wife and I) estate planning and our daughterâ€™s trust set up? Thanks in advance!  In my part of California, you'd expect to pay about $2500.
