 So my saga with this bull’’it company is continue After I paid my dues, which I’ve been told gonna automatically close my account, it’s just got suspended, even after my requests to close it with arguments that I don’t use it anymore. Yesterday I finally called those thieves ( was not going to do that, until I saw new coming bills, like more than 200 dol for 2 month) where they told me they recognize their fault of not canceling/ closing my account but I still need to pay . Please , help me with that, it’s just getting more serious.
