 This is mostly to settle an argument between me and my wife but I’d like to know if I am correct. I asked my apartments management if I could opt out of the trash collection since my work schedule makes me unable to use it within their time frames. I looked over the lease and noticed that in it it says “if selected, the flat rate is $25” but it’s not selected. When I brought this to my apartment managers attention they told me they have a contract with the waste company and everyone has to pay. Since it says if selected and it’s not selected doesn’t that mean I shouldn’t have to pay it? It would be best to convince them to stop charging you for it. Otherwise expect to fight an eviction for non-payment.
