 I have no idea if this is the correct sub to use, maybe r/scams? Anyway [ParanoidPenguin.co.uk]() is taking peoples money and not sending items or replying to emails/phone calls. They have an ebay and amazon store page where people have left negative reviews. What can I do to help people not get caught by this website in the future? How do I stop this website?
