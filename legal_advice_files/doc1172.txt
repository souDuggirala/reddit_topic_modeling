 I’ve suffered 2 injuries from 2 separate accidents at work. First one resulted in nerve damage of my foot, the second has resulted in constant pain in the knee. I was a machine operator for close to 20 years. After my first accident I could no longer do it. I was accommodated with a job within the company that didn’t involve machine operation. A couple years later (6 months ago) I go thru a new injury of the knee. Doctor says I can no longer drive and I’ll be on permanent light duty. Contacted a lawyer, after a short process period, had my deposition this week, which the lawyer did not show up to. Lawyer calls me today and says he believes I’ll only be offered around $10k in meditation and that I should just return to work, that I physically can’t even get to. Is there anyone here who has been thru or knows of a similar situation, what should I do? FYI I contacted a new lawyer who’s interested in taking over the case AFTER the mediation hearing.
