 I’ve been seeing a guy who from the beginning told me he was a police officer. I thought that was hot, but I never asked him about his job or anything. I didn’t ask for a picture in uniform either. When I was saying something about my day at work, he would share some stuff that allegedly happened on his shift. His work schedule and lack of pics in uniform should’ve been a red flag but I didn’t overthink it. I finally asked him for a verification picture and he fumbled, giving me BS reasons like “I have some on my laptop. The laptop is broken” etc. At that point it was already clear to me that he was lying and wasting my time. He finally confessed he is not any kind of LEO. I broke up with him and we’re done but I was wondering if this counts as impersonating a police officer?  Per WA statues, it seems that the person must be: - trying to defraud someone - pursuing financial gain - pretending to act in an official police capacity So this probably doesn't pass that bar.  Merely claiming to be a police officer generally is not illegal and is not "impersonating a police officer."
