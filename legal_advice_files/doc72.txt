 I was recently passenger in a car accident in Canada wherein we were driving straight at a constant speed on a roadway, and the secondary party merged lanes into the side of our car. I have photos documenting the damage to both vehicles (can post them in a comment if that's allowed), and a police report stating the damage to our car is over $3000. The insurance ruled that the fault was 50/50 since the other gentleman blamed us for the accident, which is incredibly unfair since we were the ones who were hit, not the other way around. Is there any way we can contest this, or is it set in stone? Thanks in advance for any advice! Fault rules in Ontario are set [by regulation](). Your insurance has very little discretion to adjust the finding of fault. If you believe the way fault has been assigned deviates from the province's regulations, bring the issue up with your insurance agent, or speak to an attorney. Updated post to include province (Ontario). By skid marks, do you mean paint scraped off or ground skid marks? Because it happened on the 401 so I doubt we could get anything from the ground on that highway Canadian auto insurance varies someone significantly by province. In the broadest terms in a side-to-side impact accident without additional evidence as to the position of the cars like skid marks, there may be nothing but conflicting testimony to establish what happened. r/Legaladvicecanada
