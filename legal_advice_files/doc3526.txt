 Hi there, I had a question on creative common 3.0 with this image: [\_high\_mag.jpg]() I would like to modify this image using photoshop and sell it on Etsy with recognition of the original author. Is this legal? Thanks! Yes, except they don't legally have to buy the photo in order to use it under the cc-by-sa 3.0. You're allowed to charge for a copy of the photo, but then the person who bought it can do what they want with the photo including giving it away for free under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 You can still sell the copy of the photo and you're not under any obligation to give it away for free, but other people could give away your photo for free legally. Thank you so much! I appreciate it. So, if I am interpreting it correctly, when someone buys my edited photo, they can use that photo for whatever they want under the CC-BY-SA-3.0?  =en Lucky for you, Wikimedia commons has a whole guide on how to use images outside of Wikipedia. [Here's the link to the actual image]() so you can put it in their attribution machine. Essentially, all you have to do is put a notice on the t-shirt that it's licensed under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 and attribute the original source of the image as well as what you changed. However, this means that anyone can now use your design under those exact same terms, potentially creating their own t-shirt design to sell. It is up to you whether you're OK with that.
