 A Friend and I are trying to get into real estate investing in Iowa. Friday night we found a house and placed an offer on it through our agent. They (seller and seller's agent) countered Saturday evening and we countered back. Saturday night they gave us their final offer verbally and we accepted it. Now this is where it is probably going to be bad for us. Instead of them writing up their offer, they had our agent change our counter offer which we signed, but they didnâ€™t. Monday morning they received another offer, which they told us that they had accepted. Since they were the ones to offer the purchase price and us agreeing to it; do I have any legal options and were there any ethics violations that I could file a complaint about?   By not asking them to sign the updated letter, you just made a new offer that was NOT accepted by the sellers.
