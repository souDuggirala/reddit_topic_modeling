  I e-filed a poor person form and in order to show cause. It would not let me upload order to show cause without paying and less I uploaded the poor person for him which I did and everything uploaded fine . I received a response to bring in working copies. Now the clerk stated they wonâ€™t except my order to show cause and told my poor person application has been reviewed. It is important that this order to show clause get scene in front of a judge before financial information is put out to the public and money taken from my account. What is the best way to get in front of the judge where to have my order to show cause looked?
