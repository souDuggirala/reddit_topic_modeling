 My step mother who was abusive and manipulative convinced my brothers and I that it was in our best interest for her to adopt us. Backstory doesn't really matter but my Father re-married after my mother passed away and she ended up adopting us effectively changing my mothers name on my birth certificate. She adopted us when I was about 10 and I'm 21 now, I really want to have it changed but I'm guessing it will be hard since both my mother and step mother have passed away. I don't know where to start but I really hope some of you fine people can help me. I'm in Canada btw if that is needed information. Thanks!  Thank you Undoing the adoption will be an uphill battle, and you will absolutely need legal advice on this. Unfortunately, Quebec civil law is a big mystery to most lawyers in the rest of Canada (completely different system) so I can't offer any further advice. You will want to go see a lawyer that specializes in adoptions.   and yes  Im in Quebec  There is no practical way to "undo an adoption". Your adoptive mother adopted you, and that's plainly in the past. But changing your name is relatively easy. As an adult, you don't need anyone's permission except a judge. It's done on a provincial level. For Ontario:  So, basically you want to undo the adoption? The procedure varies by province. Where are you?  Thanks, im guessing it would be public health agency of canada here, but I will do that.  Depending on your state, basically you would need to go to your State Department of Health location to fill out a request a form to Amend your Birth Certificate.
