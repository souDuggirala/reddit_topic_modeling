 The property management company I rent from is implementing payment processing fees beginning in the new year. I now have no way to pay my rent fee free. Listed below is word for word how it appears on my new lease. There is a payment processing fee of $4.95 included for any payment made online or via mailed checked/money order. Payments made in office will include a payment processing fee of $9.95. Electronic Payments: Tenant may submit payment electronically (checking or savings accepted) visa Tenant website at :"Website". There is a payment processing fee of $4.95 for this payment method. Payments by Mail: Tenant may mail payments payable to Property Manager at address listed under Notice Section. There is a payment processing fee of $9.95 for this payment method. Payment in Person: "address" during hours of 8:00am-5pm Monday-Friday, closed all major holidays. There is a payment processing fee of $9.95 for all payments received in the office. Credit Card Payments: Tenant may submit payment electronically visa Tenant Website at: "Website". There is a payment processing fee of $4.95 for this payment method. Credit Card processor may assess additional surcharges. Can they do this? Don't they have to offer me at least one way to pay fee free? I understand, but legally I don't see how you win this fight. Funny you should mention that. I actually suggested the same thing. They said if they did that the owner would get the funds and not them. Its not the amount that is bothersome but more of the principal in my mind. I hate paying "processing", "convenience" or whatever they want to call them.  Are you currently in the middle of a lease? If not, then they can probably do this. Even if they couldn't add a processing fee specifically, they could just as easily say "ok, no processing fee, but your rent is going up by $5."
