 I was in an intersection waiting for an opening. (I was in the middle of the intersection). The light turns yellow then red. I go because the cars are stopped and its red. A car runs the red in the direction I was comming from hitting my driver side causing an accident and causing me to hit a second car as rebound. The car who hit me was going over the speed limit assuming he tried to make it somehow. I went to the hospital and I was written a ticket for failing to yield at a left turn when I did stop. My car is totaled btw. Any help on the situation as of who's fault it is?  Did you happen to get their names? If you get a lawyer they can be subpoena.  This isn’t legal advice but this is one of those shitty situations where you didn’t really do anything wrong but are likely going to pay the price anyways. Sorry to hear. Call your insurance and if you wish, you can fight the ticket later. Take the time to appreciate getting out of it alive too, may put things in perspective.  Alright You don’t have a say in the matter. The other parties will file a claim if you don’t. Have your insurance do what you pay them to do.  I'm concerned about the ticket and them possibly using it against me. There was no cop there to prove that I did not stop.  There were no cameras how ever there was a gas station. As of witnesses other than the cars around I'm not sure This is why you have insurance. File a claim and let them decide. Is there any traffic cameras at the intersection? Any other witnesses?
