 Hi there, So throughout this year, I've been getting sick pretty often and have had to call in about 15 times. My immune system has always been pretty bad, so I've just sort of come to terms with it and stopped going to the doctor. However, now, my employer is using a company named Morneau Shepelle to ask me to provide an Attending Physician's Form and consent form to essentially prove I've been sick and "validate" those days. I've been sick about 15 times or so, but haven't gone to the doctor for it in a very long time. A few years approx.  Go to the walk-in clinic or doctors office, tell them you were sick with cold/flu on said days missed and need a note for your employer. They are used to writing out these notes. Usually there’s a charge of around 15-20 from a doctor for a sick note. You aren’t applying for short or long term disability so your job has no right to know exactly why you were sick. Just that you were indeed sick. Employers in Ontario are not permitted to require a doctor's note to validate an absence (at the moment). EDIT: Sorry i answered without thoroughly reading through your post. Let me clarify, employers are not permitted to require a doctor's note for absences under the Personal Emergency Leave entitlement of 10 days. Given that you've stated you've called in about "15" times, this is far beyond the PEL entitlement and therefore your employer may be justified in requiring additional information. With the frequency of sick days being taken, your employer may be concerned that there is a more significant underlying health concern that would require disability leave or workplace accommodation.  Does your company policy require that sick days be proven by a note from your physician?
