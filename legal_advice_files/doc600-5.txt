**TL:DR:** Surrendered the firearm over to local PD, then got it registered under my name. _(New York State)_

**Long Story:**

**Searching for an answer**

With the advise from the previous thread, I contacted the local Bar Association for a referal to an estate attorney. A very nice local attorney advised me his fees would be costly in research alone, and that I should “shop around” a little more. Looking around more, I got the same answer, and was directed to [the same piece of law](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/265.20) that I linked to in the previous post. I even tried a couple Gun Rights focused Attorneys with out much luck.

**The solution that worked**

In the end, feeling I had exausted my options, and not wanting to commit a felony in NY, I called and surrendered the firearm to local PD, and made a quick statement. The attending officer even said he works with these types of situations all the time. I was provided a receipt and used that to file the necessary paperwork. Now, a month later, I have a what I can only describe as a priceless family heirloom in my legal possession.


**Obligatory disclaimer:** This is only a one off situation that cannot be taken as legal precedent or advice from a lawyer. This is only my personal experience, if you find yourself in a similar situation I would STILL recommend contacting your lawyer.
