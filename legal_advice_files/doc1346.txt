 We have an inspection coming up, and they gave us about 5 days notice of said inspection. We've got two dogs, I have crate for my dog, however my brother does not. With such short notice, we can't get the time off for the two days they are doing for the inspection, with no way to schedule a time. What can be done here? I plan on trying to contact them tomorrow. I'm in Utah, and I'd love some advice. I don't see any. Your landlord is actually only usually required to give you 24 hours notice so five days notice is actually over performing on their end already.  I was just making sure there wasn't any legal issues/laws I could leverage. This is more of a practical problem than a legal one. Either buy a crate or take the dog to daycare for a couple days.  Buy a crate or borrow a crate from someone (try a vet).  Contact your vet and ask if they have a spare crate you can borrow, you'd be amazed how often they wind up with extras.
