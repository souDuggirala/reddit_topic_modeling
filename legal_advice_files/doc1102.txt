 Husband and I are married. Long term marriage with four kids. Two are grown, two at home. I’ve been blind concerning my husbands behavior for years. Last summer I was practically forced to open my eyes to her verbally and emotionally abusive behaviors towards myself and children. Yes, I feel incredible guilt. I’m processing my situation with the help of a therapist and making an exit plan. It’s as if he can sense it and his behavior has improved. My kids are also seeing a counselor. Apparently they have discussed their home life with friends and I believe a teacher from their school plans to report the abusive behavior. It’s a long story and for privacy I can’t disclose how I know about the coming report. But I know. What will happen? Could I lose my kids? If so, I will leave tomorrow ahead of the report. I can not lose my kids. He has not been physically abusive but has done some extreme things, almost exclusively when I was away from home and my kids were afraid to tell me. Im in TN and the report will be made to social services. Could I lose my kids?
