 Hello, I am a Green Card holder with an expired foreign passport and CA drivers license. I am hoping to take a "closed-loop" cruise that originates and ends in Honolulu and does not stop at any ports outside the US. I'll be flying to Hawaii from California prior to the cruise. Common sense tells me the GC and DL will be sufficient for travel (barring any cruise line specific policy). On calling the cruise line they told me this should be fine, but also can't offer legal advice (reasonable, I suppose). Thoughts? Thanks. If you aren't leaving the US, you don't need a passport. You really should get that passport renewed, though.
