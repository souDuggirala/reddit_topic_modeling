 My neighbor wants to take down some trees on the boundary line between our properties to replace her old fence and move it closer to the line. I've hired a surveyor to come out and find the boundaries and stake the line by the trees to help determine who owns the trees. How should I document this? What should I do next if it turns out that I own the trees or part of the trees to make sure that she is made aware in writing that I do not consent to them being cut down? Do I need to get a real estate attorney to draft a certified letter for me? Do I need to get an arborist to come measure the trees and estimate the age? Their current fence has been where it is for maybe 10-15 years. Do I have a right to take possession of that part of their land on my side of the fence that the trees reside on? While you're getting the survey done, reach out to see if cutting the trees is an issue in your jurisdiction. Some places heavily regulate tree removal or even disallow it. Also consider what this might do to your property values. If the trees are big enough and decorative, it may have an impact. You didn't detail the trees (size, condition, tree type), but under some circumstances it can have a sizable impact. Not a lawyer, but a land surveyor (not in Georgia). It's good that you've hired a surveyor; ask them to survey the trees and fenceline while they are there, and have them prepare an exhibit or sketch of the trees and fence in relation to the boundary line. If the trees are entirely on your property, then you own them, and the neighbor isn't allowed to cut them down. If they straddle the property line, they are shared property, and you'll have to come to an agreement on what to do. An arborist would only be helpful if you're trying to estimate damages, so that might be premature. I would talk with your neighbor first about your concerns, and then talk with an attorney if it seems like the neighbor is ignoring your concerns and the survey.   No.
