I have a friend that was put in jail for 2 days after caught drinking and driving, he was also caught with cannabis and cannabis oils.. When he was about to be released with court supervision ICE detained him. Is he going to be deported? He is in the USA non-citizen on DACA and was arrested in Iowa.

&amp;#x200B; Likely he will be deported. If you are here illegally and break the law no matter how minor (drunk driving is NOT minor) you get deported. I don't think anyone can or should speculate here.  There questions are for his attorney(s).  He will likely need a criminal defense attorney and an immigration attorney on this.
