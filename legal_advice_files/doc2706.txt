Since you don't even have this documented as a condition, you have no case...  This helps more than all the neg comments thanks You can't just say you have autism. Just like 16 year old white girls can't just decide they have anxiety and depression.  Discrimination requires unjust treatment. How were you treated unjustly here? Name calling is rude, but you arenâ€™t going to be successful in trying to sue for rudeness. Working on it this week. If I have autism how is this not discrimination??? You're not even diagnosed First time on this sub?  Really? We live in a world where people want to sue over being insulted? This is an HR issue, not a legal one. You haven't suffered any adverse action and one instance of name calling does not constitute a hostile work environment. TLDR: you don't have anything to sue over  There's virtually no recourse over a one-time incident where a peer called you a name. In order for it to be actionable as discrimination, they have to know or infer that you are actually disabled. So until you get that diagnosis, and they know, and they treat you differently because of it, you have no recourse. You have no recourse over a one time incident where someone called you a name.
