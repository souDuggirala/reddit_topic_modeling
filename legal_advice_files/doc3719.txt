 I parked my vehicle on the end of the block with no signs indicating parking rules The closest sign is about half a block away with the arrow only pointing the other way (no parking on Wednesday between 9:00AM and noon) I submitted a dispute but they returned with: (i) Sign placement. For purposes of this §4-08, one authorized regulatory sign anywhere on a block, which is the area of sidewalk between one intersection and the next, shall be sufficient notice of the restriction(s) in effect on that block. Do I stand any chance in appealing? You are obligated to know the parking laws. This includes not parking too close to the corner or crosswalk and obeying any signs on the street. So I’d say your chances aren’t too good. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try. Take some pictures showing the lack of signs.
