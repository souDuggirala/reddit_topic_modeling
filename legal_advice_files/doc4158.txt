 Hello I’m writing to find out how small claims court might work in a specific case in the state of Washington My company is part of a joint venture agreement with 2 others - an entertainment company like mine, and a non profit temple We had a contract with a restaurant for catering the event which was our joint venture I’m trying to find out how small claims would work in terms of the joint venture Do we each 3 companies bring a separate case or is there a way to file via the joint venture? If we are seeking let’s say $4000 would it be in total amongst the 3 of us or would it be x3 one per company Thanks for the help!  No, just a joint venture contract that outlined the rules we would act upon. We did also create a joint bank account Did you create a legal entity for your joint venture?
