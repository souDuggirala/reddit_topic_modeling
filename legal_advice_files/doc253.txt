 (NJ) I posted on here within the last couple of months in regards to several ongoing issues relating to habitabily within my apartment. On top of other nuisances such as noisy and intoxicated neighbors, loud TV/music at night, cigarette smoking, and general negligence snd failure to properly maintain the building, I found myself feeling "off," which recently has gotten worse to the point where my doctor suggested doing a mold test via bloodwork and mouth swab. The results came back a strong positive. The town has gotten involved and my landlord admitted to negligence. I began withholding rent on January 1st of this year, and recently put my rent for January February into a savings account. My doctor is giving me medication to fight mold while I'm still living here. My landlord is trying to reason with (bribe) me into not staying after February 28th, and told me to keep January February rent so I can use that money towards a new place to live, and has promised to give me my security deposit back in full. She had her attorney write a letter to me last week stating I'm breaking the lease (which is false, she technically broke it once she started neglecting my notices to fix and clean things within the main areas and in my unit,) with the projected move out date on it, which I never signed or agreed with. I told her I would like to move out ASAP, and have been searching daily for a new place, but haven't had luck yet. She told me if I stay past March 1st that I either need to pay her, or she'll take me to court. I told her the point of me withholding rent is to catch your attention to fix things properly, nothing more. She still wants to break the lease and have me move out. She and I both know I have a case against her if she does that, and I really don't want to have to sue her, but at the same time there's a chance I might not move out before March 1st unless I definitely find a place. Worst case scenario question: if she takes me to court, will the judge see what she's doing as a bribe and side with me, along with all of my sufficient evidence, OR will it somehow be turned on me? I'm curious to see what feedback you all give! Thank you for posting an update! All update posts are automatically locked due to a historical lack of on-topic discussion.
