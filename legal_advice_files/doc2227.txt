 As the title states, I flew in to Miami yesterday evening and took an Uber home. My gf and I had a lot of luggage and accidentally left the Switch case in his trunk. It was dark, the Switch case was black and do admit this was our oversight. We realized 15 minutes later and called him to try to establish a meeting point, if we could pick it up later or if he would prefer to drop it off. He insisted that he would drop it off and would contact us after he finished dropping off another passenger. He also stated “he wasn’t sure what it was yet...” The driver called back 40 minutes later and said there is nothing in his car and that one of his other fares must have taken the luggage from his trunk(containing the Switch and 4 games). I don’t believe him and find it highly unlikely that a passenger would go into his trunk and steal something from his car in plain sight. Also, the driver only spoke Spanish and today I received an email in Spanish about someone trying to reset my account password. I’ve reported it to Uber (who has been pretty unhelpful), Nintendo and our local police department. Does anyone have any additional advice or experiences on how they resolved a similar issue?  You've done all you can do.
