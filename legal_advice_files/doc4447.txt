 So as the title says, got a speeding ticket and have a fully clean record. Fine is $187. I'm 22 and was driving from Western Washington to Pullman to move and I got the ticket in ellensburg for 17 over 70. It was only for a moment as the speed crept up on me while matching the cars around me. I don't deny I was over it but now I'm trying to figure out what's the best course of action. I want to try for a deferral but would rather not spend the gas to go 3 hours there and back on my tight budget right now. I'm wondering if it would be easier and more affordable to have a local attorney go into court for me and try for a deferral or not. I'm unsure how the rates would be for that though. I've read it can be anywhere from $50 to $250. Thanks in advance.
