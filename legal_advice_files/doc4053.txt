 In America, if you're too poor to afford a lawyer, a useless one will be provided to you to ensure that you go to jail. Is there some sort of insurance you can buy to pay for legal fees? If not, there should be. And we're done because OP can't remain civil. Whatever man. Go away. Hahaha Wow you're pathetic. If you're asking about criminal law advice I'm guess you're gonna be in prison pretty soon. Enjoy.  You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about, and I frankly think you're lying about having read or experienced anything about public defenders. If you had you'd know you're just repeating a movie trope instead of anything reflecting real life. Again, please stop wasting everyone's time.  You heard wrong, public defenders are overworked, but they are damn good attorneys for the most part. As with private attorneys there are bad ones, but they are in court more and have more experience than any private attorney. Yes - legal insurance is a thing. This is just one example: []() \- they provide full coverage for criminal attorneys for misdemeanors or juvenile crimes, and reduced fees for felonies. However, your contention that public defenders are useless is bullshit. Many PDs are quite good at their jobs - for one thing, they're often the same lawyers that you'd contract with privately, just working for free part of the time as a requirement of their jurisdiction. They will work just as hard to defend you. Sometimes they don't give as good 'customer service', though. Also, public defenders are for the genuinely poor. If you can afford to even think about legal insurance, you wouldn't qualify for a PD anyway. 1. No. 2. Public defenders are not useless and in many jurisdictions are going to be far better educated and trained than any private you could hire. 3. I seems like you may be trolling. If so, please stop wasting everyone's time. [removed]
