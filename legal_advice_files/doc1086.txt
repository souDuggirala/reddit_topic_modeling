 So my mom and my dad are getting a divorce and my sister and I are staying with my dad (We are both over 18). My mom moved out of the house and refused to tell us where she was going. She kept a key because she hasnâ€™t moved all of her stuff out yet and her name is on the lease. Last night, she came home while we were all asleep and took two of my cats. Is there something we can do? Preferably as soon as possible? Then they sound like your parents' cats and your parents can sort out final ownership in their divorce.  I'm sorry but it sounds like they're not really your cats. Pets are considered property and your mom almost certainly had a right to take them. They were family cats from when I was a child. Are these cats that you adopted as an adult? Or family cats from when you were a child?
