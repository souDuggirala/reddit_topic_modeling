 I have a friend in a psychiatric unit in New York and they are not releasing him because they say it is against the law to be there for less than 5 days for a mental health issue such as harm to oneself. Is this true? I found a couple documents online saying otherwise but I am not completely sure and would like some advice. thanks!  Looks like your friend can be kept in the hospital involuntarily for 60 days without a court order. "Pursuant to New York State Mental Hygiene Law section 9.27, an alleged mentally ill person may be involuntarily committed to a mental health facility if: two physicians agree and present certifications that the person has a mental illness for which care and treatment in a mental hospital is essential to his or her welfare, the person’s judgment is too impaired for him or her to understand the need for such care and treatment, or, as a result of his or her mental illness, the person poses a substantial threat of harm to self or others. “Substantial threat of harm” may encompass (i) the person’s refusal or inability to meet his or her essential need for food, shelter, clothing or health care, or (ii) the person’s history of dangerous conduct associated with noncompliance with mental health treatment programs. Upon arrival at a mental health facility, a staff psychiatrist of any hospital, other than one of the two original certifying doctors, must examine and confirm that the person meets the involuntary standard. The patient may be held involuntarily for up to 60 days. The patient may be held involuntarily beyond 60 days if the hospital applies for a court order of retention and the court is satisfied the patient continues to meet the Involuntary Standard."
