 I hit a parked car on my college campus, I didn't see much damage but my friend said there was a scratch. I panicked and left and when I went back to leave a note, the car was gone. I think there was a security camera right above the car. Do I just have to wait and see what happens or is there something I can do? Correct. Wait and see what happens.
