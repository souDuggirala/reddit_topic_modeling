 My parents named me the diminutive form of the name I want to change it to (I also want to change my last name). The full name contains the letter "ł". When I'm filling out the form for the name change request, do I use that letter or should I use the letter L?  Years ago, the Illinois DMV removed the apostrophe from my last name on my driver’s license on a standard renewal. I have a typical Irish surname and Illinois has quite a few of us Micks wandering around (think Chicago). When I received the new card, i immediately went back to the desk. The clerk told me that the state was removing all special symbols from state issued IDs. I found this a bit unsettling that the DMV has the power to change my name. I have since left the country (for different reasons) and the apostrophe is in my passport and tax forms. I don’t know if the clerk’s statement is true or if he was just being a bum. TLDR: I have different names relevant to federal and state jurisdictions.  You're welcome. I've never had any problems by doing that. Newer, well programmed stuff could handle it just fine. My bank wouldn't mail a credit card to St. John's, NL because their web interface didn't regard ' as a valid character in a city name. Concerns about problems arising from non-A-Z characters are valid.   Of course, there's also the _people_ who won't know how to type special characters when trying to type your name into things. I don't think there is a better answer than this. Thank you. My first name has a letter Ł, but on all the legal documents that are written in English I just use L. I had a suspicion. I'll just go with the letter L. Do you want all computer systems to hate you forever? Because this sounds a lot like the beginning of "I have no mouth and I must scream".
