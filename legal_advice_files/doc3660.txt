 My sister is emotionally abusive and very manipulative. She cannot see me move on with my life and continues to shout, scream, threats to discredit me professionally, etc. There has been no physical abuse. There are no witnesses to any of this except her husband who will take her side. I have no proof.  NAL: I’m not really sure what exactly it is you’re looking for. According to your other post you may or may not owe her from a financial gift made to you. She also has no qualms with showing up to your office. A C D is just a letter. That may not stop her. You are not willing to let your employer/office know that she is harassing you, I understand that. The C D will explain that if she does not stop then you will resort to a restraining order. I realize you may be embarrassed by the situation but at some point your job may find out about it. It may be better coming from you before she shows up causing a scene. You don’t have to go to a doctor. Just start documenting every interaction. Don’t delete emails or texts, things like that. Edit: or it may just be time for you to become the confrontational type and stand up to her.  Perhaps a restraining order then if you can prove that she is harming your mental health. Is it possible for you to just cut contact?  You can send a cease and desist for just about anything. That doesn't mean anything will happen. You don't need to be a lawyer to send one. They're basically strongly worded requests.  You can issue a C D against anyone for anything. As a document it has no real legal weight. It’s simply a formal request to stop it. You have no obligation to interact with your sister.  A cease and desist is nothing more then a letter written by a lawyer asking the other party to stop doing what they are doing. so if you can pay a lawyer to write said letter then they might be willing to do so. edit: You could also write one yourself but sometimes it helps when people recieve a scary looking letter from a lawyer.
