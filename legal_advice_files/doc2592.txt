 Got a summons and am getting sued by other party involved. I was on my parents insurance and I got into an accident 2 years ago on my way to work in the morning. My dad dealt with the insurance stuff, but then he got me off his insurance and I haven’t been driving for the last two years. So I have no insurance now. What do I do? Should I get a lawyer? Thank you! Got it, thank you very much. Yes, if you were covered at the time of the accident they should cover the lawsuit, it’s about when the loss was suffered, not when the lawsuit is filed. From my understanding, since you filed the claim and this is regarding the same incident, they will deal with it. Will they handle it even if I’m no longer on their auto insurance? Let your insurance handle it. That’s what you pay them for
