 I lightly scratched a parked car yesterday while parallel parking and my dumb self didn’t leave a note or get any info on the parked car. I want to find the owner but have no idea where to start. What should i do? Honestly, there is probably little you can do. Do a random act of good towards someone else and hope the universe equals it all out. There is a very low chance that you would be able to find the person and make up for it without being charged with a hit and run. If you are feeling particularly bad maybe donate some money to charity and take this as a life lesson but nobody will tell you that being charged with a hit and run is a good option. What’s the best thing I could? Just go back and hope they’re parked there? Got it. I’ll see what I can do Strictly from a legal aspect calling the police and confessing to a hit and run is awful advice. Keep in mind that contacting the police to implicate yourself in a crime may not be excellent legal advice for you. Okay I’ll keep that in mind. Thank you! You can report the incident to the police and see if the other driver reported a hit and run.  I’m not too sure. Possibly but not certain. [removed] Were there any cameras overlooking the area?
