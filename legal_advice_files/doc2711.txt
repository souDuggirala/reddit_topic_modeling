 I am starting a company that sells dog training devices, accessories and treats. The company name (right now, although we could still change course, but it would be a pain) is Treater Training. I am wondering how much trouble I will have trademarking this name. There is another company called Pet Treater (which is trademarked) that is an online retailer of monthly subscription pet products. This is different than what I will be doing, but clearly related. Will I be able to get the trademark? How strong is the trademark? Would calling it Treatr Training help? Thanks for your help!
