 I owned a business (restaurant/event company) in Baltimore,Maryland that closed and need to file bankruptcy. It closed in 07/2017. I have 2 questions if I may ask: - do I need to file the bankruptcy in Maryland? I owe federal, state and city taxes. To my mind, lots of them. - I’ve been quoted and told by a firm I am familiar with and trust that it will be $1,000 up front to file this bankruptcy. Is that your experience? That is also high for my budget (please see above) I’ve been told by 1 other person familiar with the law that this is a standard price and I just want to check with you all. 1 law firm and 1 other person doesn’t seem like a large enough control group and online research mostly leads me to sites that I don’t know if I can trust. Lots of “CONTACT US NOW FOR THE HELP YOU NEED!”. Feels shady. Any advice on this would be helpful. I’m a little overwhelmed and could use some direction. Thanks in advance, I’m ready to face it now and need a little help. [removed] [removed] [removed] 1) Assuming this is personal bankruptcy, the bankruptcy is filed based on your personal location. There are separate requirements for venue (where to file) and jurisdiction (what law applies). Where do you live now? For how long? 2) Taxes can potentially be discharged. There are different standards applied to different taxes. It's highly fact-sensitive. What matters is when they were due, when you filed the return, and whether you committed willful evasion. 3) $1000 is probably reasonable for Baltimore/DC. I live in flyover country and it hovers around $600-800 for a Chapter 7.
