 As my friend was preparing to file his taxes, he realized that his employer (a very large technology company) under-withheld his paychecks. He files as single with zero exemptions which should allow him to be withheld at the highest amount possible. For reference: last year $16,000 was withheld vs this year only $1,500 was withheld. In 2017 he made $93,000 and in 2018 he made $128,000. Because of this, he is now liable for an IRS penalty for "under-withholding" and now has to come up with the money for the taxes due. His CPA estimated the amount owed to IRS is between $23,000 - $29,000. Does he have a case to sue his employer for negligence and/or fraud? Whoops... done! He received a yearâ€™s worth of paychecks and never noticed that he was being under withheld by about $15,000?
