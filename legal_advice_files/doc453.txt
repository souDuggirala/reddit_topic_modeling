 I am a 19 year old living in Virginia. My father is disabled due to a disabling stroke and his sister who lives in California (my aunt) has full guardianship over him and his assets (the guardianship was set up in West Virginia but now he lives in Virginia). At one point she mentioned adding me as a co-guardian over my father and I thought it was a good idea so I could have a say in my fathers care. Over the last year, I have repeatedly asked her to start the process but each time I ask she keeps deflecting. Just recently she said that, "these calls to the attorneys aren't cheap" and "it would take a lot of valuable time of my life and add a lot of stress to my busy life". I'm starting to get a feeling that she doesn't want me to become co-guardian anymore. In my opinon, she's a control freak and our family has had a significant history of taking advantage of disabled family members, so I'm starting to get a little ticked. My mother and I were wondering if there's a way we could petition the court without an attorney to grant me co-guardianship or if we may need to get an attorny to ensure I have a say in my fathers care. You should consult with an attorney. That'll be the best course of action if you want a chance at success. Ah, I should have specified. My parents divorced long before his condition arose.  You'll likely need an attorney. However, why does your aunt have guardianship over your father and not your mother? Or are they currently divorced?
