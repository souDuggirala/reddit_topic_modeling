 My girl friend (now ex) moved in downstairs in my apartment complex with a neighbor who is a known theif. They conspired to tell the police I spit on her, resulting in my arrest for domestic battery. I have multiple witnesses who overheard them planning what to tell the police and several more witnesses who saw them enter my house and steal my things. When I confronted the neighbor they claimed they were protecting my things from being stolen, despite me having a roomate who was moving in simultaneously. This was 7 days ago, the day i was arrested. I have now found multiple pieces of my property missing and an electric piano worth $800 is now broken. Is it too late to press charges since this occured a week ago? I was in jail and didnt notice until I returned home today.  Have you considered perhaps it's time for a change of scenery? Not too late, probably best to go in person to your area's precinct and file a report in person. Bring all paperwork you have about your arrest and as many witnesses as possible with you.  Once OP has the police report, get statements/affidavits of the conspiracy and take them to small claims if your insurance doesn't cover theft. Not a lawyer, but I highly doubt that there is a statute of limitations that is in the weeks range. Go to the police, bring your witnesses too. If you can, have a list of what is missing and pictures of you with it in your possession. Just in case your ex tries to claim it was hers. No itâ€™s not, call the local police non emergency line and report a burglary
