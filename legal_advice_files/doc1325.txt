 I've been renting from a landlord (through a management agency) for a few years now, we are currently on a month-to-month lease. About 60 days before the yearly anniversary, I received a letter from the property manager stating that the rent amount would be increased, but the amount stated was actually \~10% LOWER than the current rent. I assumed this was a mistake - my rent had never dropped in the past - but forgot to actually follow up on it. When the new price went into the effect, the amount due on the tenant payment portal was the lower amount described on the letter. At that point, I assumed the rent had actually decreased - rents in Northern California have been crazy the past few years and the market is cooling off a little. I paid the new (10% lower) amount for 2 months and assumed everything was fine. Now the property management company says this was a mistake and I owe the "back rent" for those 2 months (about \~$1,000) and sent a new later stating the new rent (increasing the rent \~2% from the amount I had been paying for the past year). Any advice on how to proceed with this situation? do I owe the $1K? I assume if I refuse they may just ask me to vacate the property (which I may be willing to do, is not by any means a great deal).  Yes, but CA law says they have to give 60 days notice. They can also terminate the tenancy , keep that in mind.  No, didn't sign anything. Just signed the original lease about 4 years ago. I only been getting a notice of rent increase every year.  Hopefully you saved that letter! They canâ€™t do that. They sent the letter 60 days ahead of time as required by CA law. That is your rent for those months. They can now send you a letter raising it, which will take effect on April 1, 60days later when rent is due. You may need a tenant lawyer. State law rules here.
