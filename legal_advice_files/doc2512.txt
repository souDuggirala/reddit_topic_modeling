 I've removed all identifying information. So my questions: 1. Is this misclassified? The duties here sound like something that would require an employee to do, as they will basically have times you are required to be there. Which a contractor is not. 2. Is the legal thing... legal? Can they have that contract be subject to only the US laws, despite me being in Canada? 3. Is the 10-day notice of termination enforceable? In the US (aside from Montana), it would be. But Canada has different laws. I suppose this ties in to the previous thing, but anyway. Here we have the probation period for some number of months, which is basically at-will, then we've got the after period, which requires more notice than 10 days, or payment in lieu, if I'm understanding that right. We can't do specific contract review. You need an attorney for that, for a bunch of reasons. However, to this question in particular: Choice of jurisdiction laws are a complicated topic. At a broad level, _if you are truly independent_, then Alberta and Canadian courts will generally respect a choice of jurisdiction clause, unless it unduly prejudices your rights. If you are an employee, the province's employment standards act overrides any terms in your contract contrary to the act, so the choice of jurisdiction law would be largely irrelevant. -day notice of termination enforceable? For a contractor, yes. For an employee, minimum notice periods are set by law. You could choose to accept less notice anyways, but you can't be forced to accept less notice. Document review is not permitted here. Post removed.
