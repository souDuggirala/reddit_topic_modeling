 So I took all the pertinent documents I could think of (registration, proof of insurance, copy of the ticket) to the DMV. They said if I could prove that I had insurance after the date my license was suspended they would remove the suspension. I now have to wait a week before I call the clerk of court to find out if they will try to prosecute me for a state clerical error or if they accept me having the suspension removed. I'll update again when I find out. Apparently if you cancel your insurance in Florida and leave the state, they just assume you're driving without insurance and suspend your license. They don't track if you have out of state insurance. I've talked to three people since the incedent who had an identical situation occur. I don't know if this info will help anyone, but hopefully it will. Thank you for posting an update! All update posts are automatically locked due to a historical lack of on-topic discussion.
