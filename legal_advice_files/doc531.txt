 Colorado has no oversight of general contractors, but they do have to be licensed in the city they work in order to even pull a permit, as I have learned. Just found out that while contractor is licensed in his city, he is not licensed in mine - at time of contract signing or since. He has made it clear prior that the contract states no refund on deposit, but being that he was never licensed, does that make contract void? Could it be considered fraud? I gave large deposit many months ago. He has since been supposedly putting together a budget and working on the plans. I have seen some incomplete plans. It's a rather long story, but specifically looking to see if Colorado contract would be considered void, and if it would be considered fraud. He used to have the same general contractor business in my town, under a different company name, so it's not that he is unaware.
