 In Utah. My SO has primary custody of his daughter. We were sent proof that recently the mother took the child out of state. Is this legal? That would be pretty unusual, because there’s no reason to give the custodial parent the ability to prevent the child from vacationing or visiting relatives with the co-parent, unless the coparent has only supervised visitation. There are laws that make it very easy to order the noncustodial parent to return the child to his/her home state, so maybe it was more common before these laws were passed? Did the child return from the visit on time and unharmed, having been adequately cared for? If so I don’t know why anyone would make a big deal out of what states the child visited. If the child was not returned or wasn’t adequately cared for, then again I don’t see why leaving the state would be the issue to worry about.  From my understanding, I thought the child could not be removed from state without prior permission from the custodial parent.  Generally, yes. If the court order doesn’t specifically limit it (and I’m not at all sure why that would be the case) and the child is brought back at the agreed upon time/place, why would it matter? It’s perfectly reasonable for a parent to use his/her parenting time to take their child to visit relatives in another state or go on a fun road trip. Unless the custody agreement says they cannot take them out of the state it would typically be fine. If they take them out of the state and don't return them at the required time that's a separate issue.
