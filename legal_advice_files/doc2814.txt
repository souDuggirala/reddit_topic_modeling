 Right now I have an undiagnosed sleep disorder but i am working with a doctor to figure out the issue. I doze off for short amounts of time and do not cause a safety hazard. I just received my last warning before termination. If I am fired, is there any recourse for me? You would presumably file for unemployment and look for a new job. So what happens if the accommodations don't work and I get fired over this?  Until you make the request the assumption is you need no accommodation for your disability and are expected to do your work as required. Including not napping. Make the request or expect to be fired. Right now nothing, I have not offered any, nor have they. Once i speak to my doctor again, I'm going to move my lunch break to later in the afternoon when I experience the issue. I don't know what I can do about the morning since it is only an hour after I arrive.  What reasonable accommodation have you requested from your work for this disability?
