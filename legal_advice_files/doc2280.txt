 My grandfather was a big-time drug smuggler before I was born. I have found his appellate case online on [law.justia.com]() but I'm not having luck finding records of his trial. I've tried using the PACER system but it only returned results more than a decade after his appeal. Since he was sentenced to 200+ years but was around for my childhood, I'd like to read up on how that came to be.  Agree with above person who mentioned newspapers. Good luck in your search &lt;3 Will call tomorrow  Dead as doornails. I never got the chance to ask about this event.  [Southern District of Illinois](); they'll be able to tell you whether the case files are still there or have been transferred to a Federal Records Center. Right they won’t scan anything old into pacer unless there was movement in his case pacer was really just coming online then too. Did he pass away? TYVM -- this will be of great interest to my siblings and I.  That's the court you call. Federal courts don't go by county. The PACER records date 1994 but his appeal was in 1983, so I think the record is incomplete. As another commenter suggested, it may be so old that they're not online. It was a federal case though, you're right.  Since you found him on Pacer It was a federal case. You could always file a FOIA request with the Bureau of Prisons to obtain records from them. Will take awhile  I don't think I can answer all that without running afoul of the rules regarding personally identifying information. His appeal was made in 1983.  Any advice on how to find the right clerk of court? He was convicted in US District Court for Southern Illinois with no mention of a specific county.  You won't find records that old online. Call the clerk of the court that convicted him. Can you give some details about who what and when you’re trying to find?
