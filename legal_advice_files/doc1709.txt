 I went over the speed limit (65 in a 55) once I got out of the neighbourhood this morning because it is a rural road that nobody is ever on. Someone behind me took a pic of my license plate and car and posted in on the neighbourhood Facebook page. Since, other people have made up stories where I passed them unsafely or sped excessively (I only pass people going under the speed limit and the roads have the dotted yellow lines). Could any legal trouble come of this? I am in the state of Georgia. No.  Nothing illegal about putting your license plate up. You cannot get in trouble for anything from it either though. I mean of people blaming me for breaking traffic laws.   Sigh. "This asshole drove too fast! Anyone know who has this car? " isn't defamation nor illegal. Neither is being passive aggressive turds.  I am not on the group. I feel those kind of groups are toxic. Someone I know told me. Could that fall under defamation of character? I don't know but that is bullshit. First off, I would screen shot they're comments and the post in case you need it in the future. Then I would report every one of those mother fuckers. I made a post about a friend I made on here with a story of how we help support each other in our journey to live through our suicidal thoughts and someone reported me. Just because I admitted that I suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts. Thats bullshit and they need they're asses kicked! Facebook community groups are a weird place...
