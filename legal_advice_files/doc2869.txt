 Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I've been having trouble looking up laws and regulations about lasers, specifically laser tattoo removal and hair removal. I have heard of filings to further restrict who can operate a laser machine, and I would like to try and keep up-to-date on current events, as I would like to open my own studio in the near future. Is there any reliable resource I can use, online or otherwise, to research current laws and attempted changes?
