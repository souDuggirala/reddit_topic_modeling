 I honestly don't remember having this service and at that time I was living in a utilities paid apartment and with roomates in at another apartment in the same year, we did not have internet service. I do not recall signing any contracts for internet service either. This was back during dialup and we would connect to the internet via phone line without any charges. I do not want to fly out to another state for court or anything so it looks like they will win. The company is called Embarq. Hereâ€™s some info on them if it helps you sort out the bill.  Is it a law firm suing on their behalf or are they in small claims court? If a law firm, call the law firm, they know the SOL on the debt. It's important to know what date of last payment they claim since that is what determines the SOL. Not sure how to handle in small claims court. You could probably fire a lawyer to fire off a letter. I wouldn't offer to settle it unless it's definitely something you owe. They could be filing a lot of lawsuits on old debts, hoping someone just coughs up cash.  I have no clue but I am assuming this falls under "Breach of a Written Contract"? I was in Las Vegas at the time and theirs goes up to 6 years. I just don't want to have to fly anywhere to defend myself, would I have to? Another thing I want to mention is that they mentioned wanting to settle it over the phone, could it be some kind of a scam? 14 years ago? What is the date of last payment that they claim was made on the account? Here is the statute of limitations in California. [http://www.courts.ca.gov/9618.htm](http://www.courts.ca.gov/9618.htm)
