 I just moved into a triplex and it's terrible. I signed an eight month lease here which I am one month into now. I'm trying to like it but can't find myself to enjoy it. I have construction workers loiter on my lawn and are super loud from 6am-6pm Monday through Saturday. The hot water is super flip-flop and won't stay hot. There is a super musty smell here and I can't figure out how to get rid of it but I think its coming from under the tiles. I think it's from the past tenants because my landlord told me after I signed the lease and whatnot that the tenants before had multiple animals that would not be let out much. Oh and only felons have rented this unit out the past couple years. I don't know if any of this would help me with getting out of my lease I'm just trying to be descriptive on what is going on here. My gut is eagerly telling me to get out of here and I want to listen to it. I was thinking of potentially doing a sub lease because I live right across the street from a University. That's where all of the construction is coming from. I feel bad too because my landlord seems like such a nice person and was really excited that I was moving here and kept telling me how much I'd love it. I'm lost on what to do from here though and would love some direction if anyone has some. Thank you. Maybe talk to the landlord and just ask? If heâ€™s a nice guy and your nice about it he may let you. You will have to give him time to find a new tenant though before you leave. You might consult a lawyer. See if you can find some mold.... Not a Lawyer. Depending on local laws, the 6am noise may be a problem, as they may not be allowed to make noise until a later date, but that is not your landlord's fault. Nothing else you've listed would be a reason to break the lease without fines or payment. Report your issues to the landlord, they should be the ones remediating them.
