 Over a week ago, I had my basketball stolen from me at the gym. Now I know it sounds silly to get irate over a ball, but it was a gift from my girlfriend and it is worth $60 dollars. I was 90% sure who the perpetrator was, but I had no conclusive evidence. The gym has several security cameras throughout the establishment including the basketball court so I asked the general manager to review the tapes with me. I was not allowed to look at the footage itself due to privacy reasons but the manager concluded that the person who I believed stole my property was indeed caught on camera walking out with my ball. Our meeting concluded with him saying that he will contact the perpetrator and do everything he can to get my property back to me. Fast forward two days later and now he is telling me that he cannot take any action and will not even contact the perp. I have thought about going to the police but I seriously doubt they will do anything to help me given it is a basketball theft. It is incredibly frustrating to know that I have solid evidence of a theft and nothing I can do about it. Is there anything I can do to at least legally reprimand the perp?  The police are a perfectly appropriate avenue
