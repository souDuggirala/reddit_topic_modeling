 When I signed up for my phone bill in my name, I was underage and lied and said that I was 19. (Legal age to put a phone contract in your name in my province.) Without thinking about it I called to ask about a bill/remaining balance on tab or wtv and when the real birth date didn’t match up they said they were going to report to fraud to contact me. The man said there’s a possibility they may let me just transfer the name to someone else of age, but they might cancel it all together. Main questions are: -Do I just tell them the truth and say I lied? - Will they put in on my criminal record/can they? I’m 17 so I’m hoping I might not be charged as an adult. -Will this affect my ability to get a credit card when I’m 19, take out loans, or other long term consequences? EDIT: I was able to sign up with a ‘credit card’ that was actually a debit, but it was still VISA so they recognized it as a credit card equivalent even though I’m not technically supposed to be able to. I did it online.  Reporting you to their fraud department has no effect on your criminal record. For there to be an effect, they would need to make a report to the police, who would then have investigate and charge you criminally. That's unlikely to happen in this situation.  They'll probably just cancel your contract.
