 So here's the story i discussed ideas of starting a shop with a friend and came up with a name for the shop. There was no current plans to open in right away but the friend moved to a diffrent state and opened the shop there with the name i had came up with. Dont thunk the shop is an actually business yet but is using the name to promote it and sell items. Wheres my royalties?  Did you register the name as your trademark? Do you have proof that it was your idea?
