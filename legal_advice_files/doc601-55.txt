In october i was laid off from a inion hvac company here in NyC. Since than i have been having a bery hard time finding work. The reason i was laid off was bc “work was slow” but the company owner owns 3 hvac companies ( 2 being union ( local 295 and local 28 i believe and a reaidential company on long island ) 
They moved me from oje company to another without my consent and didnt even ask me if it was okay. The supervisor was also bery unprofessional and would curse me out bia text message. When they moved me they hired new employees to the company i was originally in  and continued to hire new people after i was laid off. I was a hard worker and just wanted to work and learn the right things so i could
Move up in pay.  I have not but will be making a call  Have you talked to the union(s) involved about this issue? What does it/they say?
