 Okay, so if you'll recall, when they were children, the Undertaker set his house on fire, which resulted in the deaths of his parents and the horrible disfigurement of Kane. The incident occurred when both Undertaker and Kane were young children. Though it was originally thought to be a tragic accident, as an adult, Undertaker later admitted to setting the fire intentionally. What is the real world ramifications to that? What happens if, say, a 9-year-old child does something like that and kills someone? And then, decades later as an adult, they admit to doing it intentionally? Can the adult be legally charged for a crime committed when he or she was a young child?
