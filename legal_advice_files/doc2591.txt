 Separated with temp custody order. Ex is abusive. Ex recently did something that is causing me to file a separate lawsuit. Ex wants to talk to me and keeps calling me, I donâ€™t answer. Ex is now saying he wants to FaceTime to see the baby. This is unusual and an obvious ploy but I can not deny this since he is asking to see the baby. I told him he can FaceTime but I will record it and asked him if this is okay. Am I infringing on any of his rights by doing this? If he says no do I still have to FaceTime and put myself at risk?   I think you're saying that the two of you negotiated to add in some call time, that's fine but he can deny your calls anytime he likes and you can do the same if those calls are not in the order. He can also decline to be recorded.  We live in a 2 party consent state. FaceTime calls are not in the order, however when he has one overnight a week I want to be able to FaceTime her, therefore I can not deny it.  Does the tem order grant him visitation or face time calls? You have to abide by the order. You live in a two party consent state so he can decline consent and you cannot record, and if the order allows him facetime calls then you cannot decline those visits based on his refusal to be recorded.
