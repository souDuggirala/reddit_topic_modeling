 Decided to list a handgun I inherited on a firearms focused classifieds board in attempts to sell it locally through legal means (transfer/bg check at a gun store/dealer). Someone out of state emailed me and wanted info to send payment for it to be shipped so I obliged with my name, address, and telephone number. Then they followed up with a variation of the [overpayment scam]() text. I told them to cease contact and threatened police involvement. So now I'm trying to figure out how to report this to the police regardless of his silence. I'm also wondering if the guy will try breaking into my home. I know I should have only entertained local deals, but hindsight is 20/20 and I'm a little desperate for funds (thanks east coast road salt). TL;DR: Gave scammer name, address, and phone but realized it was a scam before merch was moved. How do I/can I report this to police? Should I be worried of burglary attempts? Item in question is stored off-site at a facility. I know firearms are a polarizing subject so please keep this focused on my requests. I'll have to do that next time with an address I know is bs and won't harm anybody lol. I usually play along with these guys until they send a check and then I tell them to pound sand. I figure time and money they waste on me is not being spent scamming someone else. Thanks, knowing they're not in the US helps. I'm still double checking all my cameras though heh. The scammers are now targeting niche markets. I've seen variations not only with guns, but also with musical instruments (I have eclectic hobbies). This makes the incompetent scammers easy to pick out (they're not well-versed on the cultural bits), but I have seen some semi-competent scammers somewhat convincingly discuss FFL's and magazine restrictions and such. They're not within the US, so you have little to fear of burglary. You can try to report the overpayment, but your local PD will not really know what to do with it.
