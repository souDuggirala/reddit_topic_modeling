 I paid $250.00 to go to a Chain Restaurant in Times Square on New Years and had exceptionally poor service. I’m not usually one to complain, but I was literally not served dinner or brought any drinks. I noticed all of the servers were drinking and partying and video’d it to show to a manager so I could later ask for a refund. A waitress saw me recording and took my phone and threw it against a window. She shattered the window and broke my phone. I went back the next day and was told I could not speak to a manager and I would only be given a free meal for my troubles. I’ve continually called their corporate office, but have not been given any resolution. I am considering taking legal action, but I don’t know if this is too small of a claim. Could I get some advice about how to proceed?  You can sue for the value of the used phone in small claims. It's better to try and get ahold of someone at the corporate office who has power to investigate and fix the issue though... File a police report and follow their steps I’m #teamwaitress I am also #dj2stoned
