 I have 2 roommates. We live in an apartment that is a 3 person maximum. Roommate A is still here. Roommate B paid December rent at the beginning of the month, but vanished with his stuff yesterday. He also quit his job on the spot too (when i went in to ask them where he was they said he walked out with no notice) no one knows where he is but his name is still on the lease. January rent is due on the first and roommate A and I can cover it in full this month but we kind of needed the third person to help with the rent money. I have a person who can move in but cant get on the lease until roommate B is off it. Of course I can have roomate C move in and pay under the table, but what could happen if we get caught with that? Is there a way to get roommate B off the lease without his consent? What kinds of options do I have? We are in upstate New York if that helps. Which "lease" is Roommate B on? If each of you signed individual leases with the landlord, then his failure to pay is the landlord's problem. If there was only one lease and somebody in the apartment was subletting, then the subletter must still pay the landlord in full, and is legally entitled to pursue Roommate B for payment. You need to pay the rent in full every month. You can sue the missing roommate for whatever you end up paying on his behalf.
