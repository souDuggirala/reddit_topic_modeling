 I have a friend (no it's not me) who works at a small, family owned restaurant (not his family, but it's family owned). When I asked him about his first paycheck it was way more than mine (got jobs at the same time). I asked and he said he gets minimum wage. He works 7-3 most days, sometimes more, with very short breaks. The owner is Italian so he might not know Maryland's minor labor laws. I just don't want anyone to get in trouble. What should I do? You could have gotten in trouble with your work (fired, etc.) but you wouldn't have gotten in trouble with the law.  Your employers policies have nothing to do with your friends job.  Oh, ok. When I was hired at my job I was told it was my responsibility to clock in/out in time, and if I didn't I could get in trouble. So maybe I'm worrying over nothing? No, they don’t prosecute minors for working too much.  But if the business is investigated and they find how long he's been working, won't there be consequences? This is my best friend im talking about If you don’t want to get anyway in trouble, you can stay out of it and mind your own business.
