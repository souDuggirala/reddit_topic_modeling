 So I posted about an ex friend who my boyfriend was friends with since middle school (he's in college now) who had raped me and date raped my best friend. I'll leave the link here for the full story =reddit-android This happened in Alabama So my question is... how do I go about getting him to court and helping to make sure he never does this to anyone again? Unfortunately I don't have any physical proof and neither does my friend. With my past I've always pushed down every abuse thrown my way but I'm reaching my limit. I can't handle it anymore, I refuse to sit idly by while this freak is walking around with no consequences. My mind can't handle it anymore, every few months I think about it again and I get stuck in a loop of pain, anger and confusion. I plan on going to counseling to help diagnose that I am in emotional distress about this situation. I also know I'll be ask why I took so long to report the incident and honestly I pushed it down and I knew I didn't have any proof so i figured, what's the point? Is there a way to convict him of the crimes he's committed even though we don't have any solid proof? Thank you You can talk to the police. There is no guarantee that he will be convicted or that the police will even investigate. The legal system is, honestly, not a good place to look for closure or healing. You will be much better off in counselling for that purpose.  You can report it to the police. They may or may not investigate, and the prosecutor may or may not bring charges
