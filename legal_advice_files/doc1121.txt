 I've already legally changed my name/gender via court order. My understanding is in California, 'the employer' (which I suppose would be my boss, boss's boss, etc) is required to refer to me by my new (legal) name and the corresponding pronoun. This means the boss has to change my name on the schedule, sign-in program, etc. Please correct me if anything so far is wrong. This is a company with &lt;30 employees in the branch for the location near where I live, but over 50 scattered among other states/countries. Does my boss have to notify the rest of my employees of my change in name/pronoun so they can use the correct ones or am I supposed to notify everyone? Are my regular employees at all obligated to use them? I'm just curious what the law is. Ok, I'll give it a try. Your questions are better answered by the California Transgender Law Center. Contact them and I'm sure they'll be happy to provide you with accurate information.
