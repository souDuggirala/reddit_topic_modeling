 I got a parking citation on 02/01 and today I tried pulling up information to pay it, and I called the number to pay it and they told me it has not been input by the officer yet. They told me I have to periodically call back or wait for a notice in the mail. What are my options? and how long does the officer have to put my ticket in the system? I was just hoping to pay my ticket off ASAP but I don't wanna sit on a waiting expense (nearly 400 dollar ticket :/) Just want to know my options.  Parking tickets are civil and administrative in nature. Unless your city has an ordinance stating otherwise, as long as it's a "reasonable" time, there will be no issue with enforcement. You don't start getting anywhere close to unreasonable for at least 6 months, probably longer. I guess I should of made clear, what happens if he doesnt input it? is there a certain amount of time he has til he can submit the citation? You don't have any options other than to be patient. Call back in two weeks if it hasn't been input yet.
