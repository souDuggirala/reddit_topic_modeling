 From 12/31 - 1/5 there was no running hot water in our apartment rental. On 12/31, I opened a maintenance ticket, and called our front desk concierge numerous times from then, until the 5th looking for updates as there was no communication. On 1/3 when the management folks were back in the office, I managed to corner one of them for info was told they had just found out about this. Hot water was restored on 1/5. Granted, yes, they handled the problem terribly. As well, they didn't communicate, but it evidently impacted a low percentage of the people in my building (I don't have an official number, but think maybe ~30% of the building) of 200 units was the holidays so a lot of folks weren't aware until they got home on 1/2. Also, I did call the city to file a complaint on 1/3 since I was being dodged those 4 days. This all being said, the Chicago statue confuses me as to if I am able deduct $$ from my rent or building utility payment for the hot water outage during this time. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!
