 Ok basically im in HS and there is someone who wants to fight me, i have not instigated any fights or anything but im wondering if they punch me can i fight them back without facing any legal repercussions (By fight them back i mean fight them as in we both start throwing punches) I think that the best thing you can do is to report this to a school official, so they can solve the issue, if they fail to do anything then you will at least have evidence of attempts to avoid conflict. If you are attacked I would recommend shoving as this is usually not classified as assault in most High Schools, and will keep the person away from you until teachers arrive. Do not punch them. It usually makes more trouble than it is worth. Maybe. In Ohio, you have a “duty to retreat” in public places (though not your home or car). Essentially, this means that if someone attacks you, you have a duty to flee, disengage or retreat if you can do so safely. Basically, if you can get away from the fight (by yelling for help, running away, etc) the law expects you to do so. If you can, but don’t, you could be found guilty of assault. If you can’t retreat you are allowed to defend yourself with force “proportionate to the harm reasonably feared.” In other words, you may punch to defend yourself against someone punching you, but probably can’t shoot them. That also means that once the attacker no longer presents a reasonable threat (they run away, are knocked to the ground, beg for mercy, etc.) you may not continue retaliating. In Ohio, self-defense is an affirmative defense - you have to prove that your actions were justified, rather than the state having to prove they weren’t. Finally, none of this prevents the school from disciplining you for your actions. Even if a court finds you not guilty, you can still be suspended or expelled. All told, you are almost always better off going to a teacher, police officer or other authority figure rather than resorting to violence.
