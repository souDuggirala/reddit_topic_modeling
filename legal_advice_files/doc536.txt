 My truck was parked at work and a coworker backed up into it. My vehicle has valid insurance but the registration was expired at the time of the incident. Who's at fault, should i call my insurance company, whats going to happen?! Located in NWT Canada. Anyone who hits a parked car is automatically at fault.  even if my registration is expired though? I have a feeling that i'm in trouble since its expired. The vehicle that backed into you is at fault. Some insurance companies require you to contact them in the case of an accident, even if you aren't going to file a claim. Check with your agent to see if it is required.
