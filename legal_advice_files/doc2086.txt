 So a buddy of mine had a case of mistaken identify after a warrant was served and he was taken to jail in Delaware. The warrant was for a completely different person and the error has been identified. Unfortunately, there allegedly was some illegal stuff in plain sight within the residence where the warrant was served. Is he still going to be charged even though the warrant wasn't valid? Or does this constitute an illegal search. Not looking for legal advice, just curious how this all goes. I know we're all responsible for our actions, but it still sucks to see someone you know end up in a bad situation. He needs a lawyer immediately. Warrants have to be specific in terms of people seized and places searched. If he didn't look like the other guy and the wrong house was searched he may have a basis for a lawsuit. A real life attorney will need to assess the case.
