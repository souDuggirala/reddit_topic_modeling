As the title suggest, I have steam pipes running through my apartment in NYC. The past few weeks I have been woken up 5 - 6 times per night due to an incredibly loud banging sound. This is starting to take a serious toll on my health. I have contacted the landlord, and they said they would look into reducing the noise. However, beyond that, do I have any further rights to eliminate the noise? Any advice would help greatly.  You know what? Call 311 and complain. If you're used to living in a house or quiet area and can't handle noise, you are going to be constantly in distress living in NYC. You should move. I don't understand how this does not become a quality of life issue? If the noise happens so often that you are unable to sleep, there should be some remedy for that? Realistically you're never going to totally eliminate that noise. Simplistically the way steam pipes work is that the riser you see in your apartment has a pipe inside it. If you're living in a prewar or tenement building it's likely the pipes are old and sagging from decades of use and cause the noise. Your landlord can have someone make sure nothing is loose and rattling, and that the pressure is set correctly, but beyond that you're not going to get the remedy you want of no banging pipes. That's part of the price of living in NYC. It’s “water hammer”. Google it. Should be relatively easy to remedy.  [removed] [removed]
