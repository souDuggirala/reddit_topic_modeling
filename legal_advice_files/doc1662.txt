 Recently a company purchased a golf course in the middle of my neighborhood and converted into a distillery and venue for rent. Quite often the venue holds outdoor concerts with fireworks starting around 9pm and going until around 3am. The sound is so loud it travels for miles disturbing everyone, making it impossible to sleep. The fireworks are disturbing war veterans, triggering their PTSD. The fireworks are littering the neighborhood. The entire establishment is so extremely disturbing, causing misery and stress to everyone living around it. The company isnâ€™t willing to listen to the neighborhood association. I want to do what I can to help stop these concerts and fireworks and bring peace to the neighborhood, I am just not sure where to start?  Check your city's noise ordinances and see if they're in violation. If so, then call the police and write your local legislators. If no such laws exist, then you can speak with the establishment and see if they're willing to be amenable to their neighbor's wants.
