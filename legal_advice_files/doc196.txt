 At the beginning of the year I purchased some frosty key tags from Wendy’s. At the time they said that I could get multiplied every time I visit if I had multiple key tags. They honored that many times in the past. However they decided that now they only will allow one jr frosty no matter the number of key tags. Naturally I feel kinda like it sucks. The wording on the keytag is: “one free Jr. Frosty per transaction per visit per keytag. Valid only at participating locations. Offer expires 12/31/2019. Wendys.com/adoption” The way I read that is if I have 10 key tags and I roll threw with 3 friends and ask for 4 free frostys I can get them. Yesterday I was told I can only get one. They still claim they are participating, but that the tickets only allow one per a visit. Is there any legal precinct that applies to the 9th circuit about the wording of x per y per z per w? Thank you if you have anything that helps me and my friends crusade to restore the one frosty per a keytag each visit! Yes thank you, everyone is focused on the per transaction and ignores the per keytag part. Just ask for separate transactions next time you go with your friends and then just put it all on your card or cash or whatever the way it's written means they were correct in giving you one free frosty per keytag before. If it was only supposed to be one frosty total it should just read "per transaction per visit." No, why in the world would you think that, one per transaction doesn’t mean use once and it’s over, it means that you can use it once for each transaction. It also makes it clear you cannot use the same one more than once per visit. By that logic wouldn’t it also they keytags be one use only? Which clearly the keytags are not as they don’t take them they just ask to see them. If you made 9 different transactions you might have a case, but one per transaction seems to be pretty clear. That the employees were wrong before doesn’t really change that.
