 I came across a Kickstarter campaign earlier, and I was wondering if that was not copyright infringement. This person is literally using character designs she doesn't own (they're from Ghibli Studio), to ask for funds, and sell these pins. I can't link her campaign because of the rules in this subreddit, but you can find it by a quick google search "kickstarter ghibli companions pins". It's the first link. She says that these characters are fan-made and she doesn't claim them, but the thing is that she is still making money off of something that she doesn't own. So is not that technically illegal despise her disclaimer? On the same topic, it makes me confused when I am browsing RedBubble and I see all this cool fan-made shirts based off of movies / video games characters, I've been wondering for a while now how these artists can get away with that if it's breaking copyright laws. Or maybe it's just me and I don't understand copyright laws. Are they really allowed to sell shirts based off of video game characters they don't own?
