 I’ll avoid being too specific to avoid recognition. This happened in the U.S. A few weeks ago, a classmate confessed to me that she has an almost 30-years-old boyfriend. She’s been dating him since fifth grade, and her parents approve of the relationship. It was hinted that they’ve had sexual relationships. Should I take action? If so, what can I do to stay anonymous? Should I contact school authorities first or go directly to CPS?  If you have concerns about a child's welfare - and a 15-year-old being in a sexual relationship with an adult would be very concerning - you can [report your concern]() to the state's child welfare office. They can investigate, and can get warrants if necessary. I'm normally hesitant to tell outside parties to call CPS on a family, for a whole range of reasons, but in this case there isn't really a better option. I am considering making an anonymous report, but that would probably make me easily identifiable. I have written evidence of the relationship, if that helps. The boyfriend is over a decade older than her. Even if their parents approve, it sounds like they’ve been groomed and/or have been grooming her for awhile. Take action and anonymously report either to the school or the local authorities. Maybe ask another adult to report for you if you’re uncomfortable with it. Even if they can’t do anything (i.e. parents concerting), there could be other people this guy is doing/has done this to. She is just a kid. 15 How old is she?
