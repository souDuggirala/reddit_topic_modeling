 Any liability on my part? She said they can't use her address because it'll somehow affect her Medicaid (or Medicare? Not sure which one). I don't necessarily mind them using my address but really don't want to be liable or otherwise have it affect me. No. Donâ€™t do it. Thanks. Told her no.  Thanks. Told her no. Don't be a part of fraud. Tell them you are uncomfortable lying and they can use anyone else stress if they want to It would be her Medicaid application. Medicare doesn't care how many people live there or what their incomes are, but Medicaid is based in part on household size and income, and extra people in the household with extra incomes would need to be reported and calculated into her eligibility.  Yes but then they'd never receive the certificate. What happens if they use OP's address anyway without his approval or prior notice? Couldn't they technically use anyone's address they wanted to? Yes. Her eligibility is affected by the number of adults in her home. Essentially, if she had two extra adults in her home, the expectation is that her expenses are lower.  I don't know what the specific fraud is. But I know there is no reason for them to lie that's not related to some sort of improper activity. Otherwise, they could just tell the truth.  just so I'm clear, the fraud is my aunt not reporting them as part of the household on her Medicare application? There is no circumstance in which you should assist in what is clearly fraud on their part. There is no reason to lie that's not going to be related to illegal activity.
