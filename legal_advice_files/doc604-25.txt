Crashed into a guardrail and tore up the side of his car.  Pulled over to the side of the road and called AMA.  Said they'd be about six hours.  Really crappy day for driving, but we were trying to get back from an out of town office party. 
Fire and rescue came and said they would take us to the nearest town, about 18km away.  So sure, beats sitting in a car for six hours.  While we were waiting the cops decided to call out another toe company to clear the road.  About eight or ten cars in the ditch or crashed aside from us.  
Now the towing company wants over $600 for towing 18 km.  Including $200 for calling out a traffic control truck.  I think it's an insane price.  Is there anything we can do because we didn't asked to be towed by them. [deleted]
