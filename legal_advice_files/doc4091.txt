 Im finally getting my lofe together o have two good jobs and im going back to school in january but my parents smelled one hint of weed n now they want to have me arrested n take away my car and everything ive aquired so far... im just wondering if they do call the cops can i actually he arrested if they find weed or can i just say u e never seen that b4 andnim just a resident ofr something  The exact penalties would probably depend on how much they found. If it's found in your room, then it's very easy for the cops to figure out that it belongs to you. Yes. You will be arrested. All that the police need for an arrest is probable cause. “Probable cause,” means the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the arresting officers and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the accused had committed or was committing an offense. This standard is met by your parents calling the police and pointing them at your room. Even you’re not in the room, because it’s your room you have “constructive possession,” of what’s there. At trial, you can certainly argue that you never saw it before. It will be up to the judge (or jury) to weigh your credibility and decide if they believe you. Maybe flushing the weed now is a good idea, if you happen to find any. If they find it they can arrest you.  in smyrna georgia weed was reduced to a fine recently in the atlanta area but im not sure if that counts smyrna... and is that considered in my possession or is it in my parents possession cuz many ppl live under that household can i not just not claim it? N yes im over 18 [removed] If weed is not legal in your area, then yes, you could be arrested if the cops find weed in your possession. Where are you located? How old are you? Are you above 18?
