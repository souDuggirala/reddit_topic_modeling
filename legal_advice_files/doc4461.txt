 A friend (31F) and her boyfriend have agreed to have a child together under the circumstances that if the relationship ends, the boyfriend would not be financially responsible for the child. They would like to have this legally setup before the child is conceived. Both live in Florida. The boyfriend has done consultations with two family law lawyers who both only offered that the boyfriend gives his sperm to a sperm bank and then my friend gets her boyfriend's sperm artificially inseminated. The friend would to like to conceive and have the child naturally. Is there legally a way for them to set up him not being financially responsible for the child if they breakup without artificial insemination?  Not only would he be liable for child support if they do it the "natural way," but also the state would come after him with or without the mother's assistance if the kid ever receives any state aid. Listen to the lawyers. I seriously doubt that would work if the dad has anything to do with the babies life. No. The right to receive child support belongs to the child, and the parents cannot sign that away on the kid's behalf. You'd have to convince a judge that dad not paying support is somehow in the kid's best interest, which is very difficult even when dad is an abusive jerk, and quite impossible when the child doesn't exist yet. They have consulted with multiple lawyers in person, and should trust that advice over this sub. You get what you pay for, after all. If they are still unconvinced, they should look for a third opinion A mother can't waive her child's right to child support. Sperm donors have additional protections, but since they're in a relationship and presumably having sex, that may muddle the waters there. I assume the lawyers they've met have addressed this No. Artificial insemination through a licensed clinic is literally the only way.
