 The kind of story that will make your blood boil. Mr. Junkie had to take his two daughters (9 and 12) back after Ms. Methmom was caught planning to sell them for sex (Residence in WA state). He ( Meth addict and violent drunk) took a lot of convincing but finally took my advice and allowed his sister (Residence CO state and is currently providing stability and wholesomeness that they deserve). He has been off Meth for 3 weeks, found an old friend to get him off the streets and is hellbent on taking the girls back. The kids are scared (Were all scared). Is there anyway he could legally get them back, even if he signed a paper allowing his sister guardianship? I assure the other details of this dibocle are truly horrific and unsettling  Yeah, we can't help with this. The custodian needs an attorney, as does any actor in this tale. We cannot possibly unpack all of the important factors that might suggest an outcome. If dad is clean and not abusive, he quite possibly does have a shot at reunification. The court and state always only remove with the goal of reunification, and allow adoption once they deem it highly unlikely. This will be a difficult and contentious matter, and aboslutely needs to be handled by a lawyer, not well meaning relatives not directly involved. Morbid obesity is not cause to deny someone parental rights, by the way.  Right now it sounds like he can show up and take the kids back whenever he wants. The sister can talk to a lawyer about getting custody, or if he does take the kids she can call CPS if there is a current danger.  His sister needs to speak to a lawyer and work on gaining full, formal custody.
