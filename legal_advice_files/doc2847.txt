 Me and my Fianc√©e have started to look around our area to find a possible apartment to rent. Ideally we would like a 2 bedroom so we can have some extra room. I was emailing back and forth with a property manager for a specific property we both liked. During the back and forth I mentioned that we would mainly be interested in a 2 bedroom. He informed me that they only rent out 2 bedroom apartments to individuals with children or multiple couples looking to live in one apartment. I was just curious if this is legal or a form of discrimination? Thanks for the help in advance! That sounds legal. Likely they have more trouble renting the smaller units and are hoping that you'll say OK and take one. I'd email back and tell them that you're only interested in a two bedroom and to let you know if one becomes available that you could rent. Their tune may change... I'd be surprised if it's a hard line for them.  There are restrictions on required sqft per individual but that's the other direction and a legal requirement. No protection that I'm aware of here would apply. No protected classes and they're willing to rent to you. They could just have a harder time filling the smaller units. Lots of places have waiting lists for a certain layout/remodel or a better view.
