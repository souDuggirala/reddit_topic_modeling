 Hi all - I'm back. So my mom passed away unexpectedly in August and I am the oldest of 5 siblings. In the process of trying to take care of estate, we have a house to sell. We've been getting it ready to go on the market, and I have 2 worthless brothers (29 30) who are essentially homeless the last 3 weeks. They have started moving into this house. Mind you I am the administrator of the estate, and we have insurance on the house which specifies that no one can be living there. They haven't technically moved in; and haven't established residence (all bills are under my name and no mail is being delivered there). Do i have any legal recourse to get them out of the house, so we can give the realtor keys and she can show the house as needed? I don't know because they are 'technically' 1/5th ownership of the estate, if that means I cannot legally do anything to get them out; until it sells? Let me know what you guys think and if I have any options? Also I am located in Wisconsin. Per the courts - we have to sell it; it was part of my mom's divorce decree that the house needed to be sold. So that's why we are selling it. This sounds like all parties with ownership to the property havenâ€™t agreed to sell it.  Right now the title is in the estate's name - which we are all legal owners of - so no one will own it once the estate is settled, because it will be sold. (not sure if that is what you were asking) Who is on title/lawfully owns the property once the estate is settled?
