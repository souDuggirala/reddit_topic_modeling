 There's a huge gap in my employment now because of an open heart surgery I had back in September, so I feel like I have to explain what happened to employers. It has felt like a lot of employers have been afraid of hiring me because of it (I work in sales). Interviews that I have typically breezed through and have received offers have gone cold. One guy even asked me if I could handle the stress of a sales job again because of my heart. This seems like a red flag. I'd love to just not bring it up, I know I technically don't have to, but then I have no way of explaining this huge gap in my employment which looks really bad. I'm trying to find some middle ground as to what I can do in this situation, but I'm at a loss. Any help is greatly appreciated. I'm trying my best to get back on my feet, and i've got a lot of new medical bills to pay I'm getting later on every month. My condition is congenital and very independent from the lifestyle I live, but employers seem to still not want to take the risk. I live in Utah. No legal question asked. Post removed.  Just say you got hit by a car or someone in your family was sick, or that you took a personal leave. It’s none if their business and it’s a personal medical matter.  I decided to live off of savings for a while, travel a bit, visit my family, and enjoy the holidays. The time off was fun but now it's time for me to go back to work. You could actually have a case there if they ask you stuff like “are you sure your heart can handle it”. But in any event, you could maybe tell employers you had surgery and just keep the details to yourself? Because you’re correct, you don’t have to tell them anyways. You had a serious surgery but you’re all good now. That’s all they need to know. I wish you luck, though. You don’t have to tell them what kind of surgery it was. Tell them your doctor has cleared you for employment.
