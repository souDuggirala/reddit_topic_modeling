 (Oklahoma) this past week my parents were looking at a new car on the dealership lot. Thy found the car they wanted on the lot, 2019 Jeep Cherokee Latitude and the sales manager at the dealership told them the lowest he could go on it was $36,000. My folks then found that car on that specific dealerships website with (roughly) $9,000 in rebates and the sale price on the website for that car (almost the exact same one that they were looking at on the lot) for $31,000. When they asked the dealer why there was a difference in price in what they were offering them for the one they were looking at and the one on the website for -$5,000 they said it was because they had a military rebate on there as well. My parents couldn’t find on the website where t said anything about that. In my opinion this is false advertising. What should I do about this? Is there an office in Oklahoma I could call?? Thanks It is quite common for the dealer to list every possible discount n the website, even some that are contradictory. IE You can't simultaneously be a returning lease customer and be a new customer. That's how it goes. Nothing illegal. Just had this come up recently when I was shopping for a truck. Each dealer had a MSRP, then a bunch of rebates listed and then a low price. You have to read through the rebates to see what’s applicable for you. Or find an honest salesperson to do it for you. The low price is how they get you in the door and then bam, here’s the actual price. Which is never what you saw online to begin with. It’s not false advertising, it’s what’s available if you met all the criteria which doesn’t always happen. Since I had done my research, I was able to go to a dealership after I had a conversation over the phone and email with what I was eligible for knowing how much the truck was.  Thanks! Nothing illegal about that. They can offer different prices to different customers. Move on nothing to see here.
