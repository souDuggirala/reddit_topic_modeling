 PA resident here. A few months ago my wife and I bought a used boat from a private seller in GA. He sent lots of detailed pics and videos as well as a list of things that came along with the boat. We went back and forth a little on the price and came to a number we were both happy with. I arranged transport and the boat arrived a few days later. Everything was as described as far as condition of the boat and trailer went. All seemed well. A few days later we started to take everything out of the storage areas so we could give the entire boat a good cleaning. During this time we realized a few things were missing that were included in the original for sale post and discussed before purchase. They included a full camper enclosure (open bow boat), carpet and extra seat cushions that make the back area into a big sun pad. All told the items are worth about $3500 new. We contacted the seller about the missing items, he said he would send them right away. Almost all communication has been done through texting in order to have it documented. That was in August... We’ve reached out to him several times and still have not received anything. Whenever we contact him he always has another excuse as to why he hasn’t gotten it shipped yet. My question is what type of recourse do we have at this point? I feel like the value of the missing items is considerable and they were explicitly listed or discussed before finalizing the purchase. Does him being in a different state affect our options?  What are the missing items worth used? New price is irrelevant.
