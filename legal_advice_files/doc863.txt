 I owed my University 7k in tuition and it got sent to collections. I was only contacted by the collections agency once 4 years ago and I never made a payment or was called by them. Just wondering if the statute of limitations applies to this kind of debt. Also what happens if you do not pay it? WIll it remain on your credit report forever? Okay thanks :) Honestly, it's pretty doubtful that they could summon you and get legal proceedings going in two months. I think you're probably okay.  I think that is exactly what I will do. Turns out I still have 2 months until the statute is up. They only contacted me once when the account was opened and I never heard from them again. I don't even have the letter anymore. So I hope I wont get sued now lmao Yes, the statute of limitations applies to this debt. Depending on your state, they could still possibly sue you for it. You could just take the chance and never pay it. It will fall off your credit after 7 years.  Thanks :) Check out this website for the SOL . Chances are the debt is past the SOL. []() Pennsylvania Debt Collection Statutes of Limitations Contracts: 4 years, (used to be six). Contracts under seal: 20 years. Sale of goods under UCC: 4 years. Negotiable instruments: 6 years (13 PA C.S.A. .§3118). It is from the institution. I did not get a loan for it. As I know it, most collections leave your credit report after seven (7) years...if it is a federal loan, it will not be forgiven, as in, it won’t clear if you file bankruptcy. they can come after you whenever they want, and garnish your wages or take property as payment. if it’s from the institution itself it might be different, and might count as any other debt would. If you’re worried about it, i’d contact a bankruptcy lawyer around you for a free consultation.
