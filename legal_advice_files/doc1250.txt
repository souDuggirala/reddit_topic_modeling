 Given it's in my name am I screwed? How does it get figured out? If the debt is for something tangible, like a car, make sure you get the title in your name so you can sell it and pay off the debt. Do NOT get into a situation where your ex holds title/deed to an asset and is supposed to refinance a loan that is in your name, because if his credit is bad then he won't qualify. Make sure any joint debts are paid in full, and not assigned to him to pay off over time. The lender is not a party to your divorce decree and will come after you for a delinquency even if he is supposed to make the payments. The judge will help decide who is responsible for what. Talk to your lawyer about these.  Did he forge paperwork?
