 i use deviant art as my main form of income through commissions but for the past day or so i’ve been repeatedly harassed and spammed on my main account. the messages range from potty humor to racial slurs and stuff like “i hate transgenders” (i’m trans). they’re also purposely using the name of one of my abusers for their accounts. i’ve contacted deviantart support but there making accounts faster than they can do anything about them. they used a vpn to circumnavigate an ip ban. google analytics tells me that they came from 8chan through a link if that helps.  Well you’re a better person then me  [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted]
