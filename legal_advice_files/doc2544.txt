 A few months back I was convicted of misdemeanor possession of marijuana. I went to court for it and was placed into a deferral program which involves going to a class. I have yet to attend my class and do not go back to court for it until April. Just last week I also received a drinking ticket during all of this. The tickets happened in separate courts. I am very unsure as to what happens next. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  And very likely have an obligation this new contact with law enforcement to your probation officer or whomever is supervising the terms of your prior arrangement.
