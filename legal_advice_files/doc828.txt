 There is most likely going to be a lot here so be prepared and any advice is welcome so please read (also useful information while reading this- my great aunt draws a disability check every month, that is where her income comes from) I have a second cousin in Virginia who lives in a house with her boyfriend and my great aunt. The house was previously my great grandfather's, who was (obviously) the father of my great aunt. When he died he left a clause in his will stating if my great aunt (his daughter) were ever forced out of the house when he died by my second cousin (his grand daughter) then they would have to pay her half the amount of money the house would be worth. Well recently a falling out has happened and it seems like they are going to attempt to kick her out of the house. Why you may ask? because she forgot to take the dog out during the day, and asked if the boyfriend could which made him extremely mad. The boyfriend along with my second cousin are very bad people. the boyfriend has not only abused his mother, and girlfriend, but they also starved a dog (to actual death) because they wanted a "new" puppy. Why didn't my great aunt stop or report this? I'm told it's because she did not want to go against my second cousin and boyfriend and get kicked out of the house. I'm also going to assume when/if my second cousin and boyfriend attempt to kick my great aunt out of the house they will most likely refuse to pay her. My question is what can be done about this? What's the cheapest method viable for my great aunt to get what was left to her? Can the abuse or starving of the dog be used against my second cousin and boyfriend in court? If any information is needed that i have left out please tell me and I will reply/ update the post
