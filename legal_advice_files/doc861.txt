 Last year I witnessed a murder in the state of Texas. I have since moved because I am a nervous wreck. I got a call from the ADA about a week ago now reviewing what I saw and saying that due to evidence rules they will probably have to fly me in to testify because she doesn't think anyone has been approved in the past to use any other means such as skype. Again. I am very anxious in general, and this incident basically wrecked my mental health. I don't want to go there if I don't have to. So my question is really, is she pulling my leg about these evidence rules? And also (I know this may sound petty) does my job have to pay me for any days missed for this? ( I hope that doesn't sound stupid, I was told they might.) Yes you would likely have to appear in person. In very specific cases they will allow witnesses to testify remotely, but this is typically for cases of child victims. You could potentially try to a deposition, but you would still have to fly in for that. In most cases, your employer is not required to pay you, though they do have to let you off work if you have a subpoena. The prosecutor, however, should pay your airfare, travel, hotel, and a daily witness fee. It might not add up to your daily pay, but you wonâ€™t get nothing.
