 I now work with students through a community-based organization and recently some questions have come up around mandatory reporting. I still have a valid teaching certificate from Texas and am wondering if I in any way put that certification at risk if I do not report suspected abuse or neglect in my new capacity. It would also be helpful to know if this would be the case for someone with a social work degree since I work with other staff members who have other direct service certifications. Thank you! It's all laid out in Chapter 261 of the Texas Family Code. DCF's [in-English breakdown](http://www.tccwb.org/resources/mandatory-reporting-laws-in-texas/) is somewhat helpful. It does say that professionals are required to report suspicions meeting the threshold within 48 hours, though I would want someone who's seen this requirement enforced in Texas to answer your question about revocation. Also, it would be worth finding out if, in Texas, you are designated as a professional on the basis of your active employment or your licensure. That is great to know. Do you happen to know the relevant statute? My question is also about what happens when I move out of state. I am no longer in Texas but my teaching certification is still valid so wondering if there is a risk of it being revoked if an incident were not reported. In Texas, it doesn't matter what your credentials are. Every adult is a mandated reporter, full stop.
