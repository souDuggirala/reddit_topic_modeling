 I did some googling before asking here, but all I find are resources for the US. Two questions: A friend's Facebook got broken into by her ex. How illegal is it in Canada? Through this unathorized access, he also got access to my entire chat history with her, which includes a lot of personal information. Do I have any recourse? Thanks!  's Facebook got broken into by her ex. How illegal is it in Canada? It's illegal. Probably not until he uses it.
