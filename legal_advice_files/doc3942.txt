 I work locally as a driver/merchandiser driving a box-truck . But there are times when my company asks me to cover a shift for one day in a different city about 90 miles away, and I was always paid to drive to this city on my personal vehicle to get to the warehouse I’d be working out of. So recently I got a new supervisor and I noticed on my paycheck that I’ve stopped being payed for driving to this other city, when I brought this issue up with my supervisor, he told me the company isn’t obligated to pay me in this situation. Is this legal? I remember my old supervisor saying the company was required by law to pay me for driving to another city at their request. Not sure what to do.
