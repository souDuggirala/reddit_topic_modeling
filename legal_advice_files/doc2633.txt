 I've gotten into trouble with my perants concerning me having a free house and having a few friend over along with a certain substance without their knowledge and I was wondering if they can legally look through my phone without my consent, I know there's some sort of law about the perants taking responsibility of whatever is on their child's phone if the child is under 16, so I'm just wondering if they're allowed search through my texts, etc... without my permission  Did you pay for the phone, and do you pay for the monthly service plan? I am having trouble trying to understand how it's not obvious that a child doesn't have a right to privacy.  Parents are allowed to invade their minor children's privacy; in fact, sometimes it's impossible to effectively parent without doing so. Because it is; they’re OP’s parents. I don’t know why you gotta act like it’s obvious. Sounds like an invasion of privacy to me. Of course they can. You're a child.  Yes you are a minor
