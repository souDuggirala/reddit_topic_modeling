 I was thinking back to my first job as a hostess, and there were several times where there would be vomit, fecal matter, or even blood in the bathrooms that would need cleaned up and the managers first stop would be the host stand. Luckily for the, it was usually the poor bus boy that was forced to do it but Iâ€™m curious as to if there are any safety laws against that or precautions that are supposed to take place. I live in Illinois.
