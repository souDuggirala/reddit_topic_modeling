 Luckily everybody is safe, her car is a little banged up and the other guy’s car fared a little better. They both exchanged license and insurance info and left the scene and went home since the police said they’d be a few hours. There were 7 accidents in that area alone on Apple Maps. The police said since she’s not waiting for them to arrive, she’s obligated to write a report on the DMV website for insurance purposes. My mother admits she was at fault, but I wasn’t sure if there’s anything I should let her know before she calls her insurance or writes her DMV report. P.S. I’m new to this app, so if this is the wrong sub please let me know and I’ll fix it.
