Two posts to give some perspective:

I donâ€™t know what questions to ask, what my rights are as a mother, or what to be careful of. What can I do to protect myself without causing a major family fallout?  Get a lawyer. If he is preventing you from accessing money to pay for one a lawyer can work with the court to make him pay the costs. The two biggest things you'll want to be careful of are

* an enforceable custody and child support arrangement, which generally means a court order, and
* an enforceable division of assets and spousal support agreement, which generally means a court order.

Those orders can be stipulated agreements rather than the result of arguments and filings, but until it comes from a judge, you're at real risk your ex-husband will back out or refuse to comply and that you will be left with very little to do but to go to court over it. Get an attorney, do this right, and be prepared to go back to court to enforce anything he deviates from.

The reason your ex-husband wants to do this outside of the courts is so that he won't have to cooperate if he doesn't want to. It helps him, and doesn't help you, and _definitely_ doesn't help your kids. I think the advice given in the other threads is sound: do whatever it takes to get yourself a competent divorce attorney, if you wish to seek a divorce, then listen to that attorney.
