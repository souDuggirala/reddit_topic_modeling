 An intellectually disabled family member is being scammed by a person claiming to be Hugh Jackman. The family member, Bob, has been sending almost his entire paychecks to this man. "Hugh" says the money is going to a charity, or to help with a car accident for his wife, or whatever. Or that the money will help Bob become an actor and move to L.A. Bob doesn't understand that none of this is happening. People have tried explaining it to him nicely, and not so nice. His mother called the police who told her they can't help any. Bob is over 18 and can do what he wants with his money. It's frustrating to watch him throw away his money, and be getting his hopes up. When he does realize it, he will be crushed. "Hugh" has sent pictures and pictures of signatures. To prove himself. The pictures are all the top google or facebook ones. The signature is off of some coffee brand. I tried to explain how easily anyone could get access to this, but Bob doesn't understand. Here is a more concerning part: "Hugh" is suppose to meet Bob is person this weekend. I live too far away to accompany Bob for his safety, and I don't think he has told anyone else. I think one of two things could happen: 1) no one shows, because obviously the real Hugh won't be there Or 2) someone does show, and it becomes a very dangerous situation Does anyone with experience with intellectually disabled adults have any advice? What about advice for money scam victims? Please, how on Earth do we fix this? His parents should call APS and see if they have resources available to help. Do they not have any type of power of attorney for him?  You can go to the local PD, and ask to file a police report on behalf of Bob. Better (but far more difficult) might be to have a family member of Bob's become his financial power of attorney. It would seem reasonable that if Bob is being tricked into giving his money away to a scammer, that he may not be fit to manage his finances.
