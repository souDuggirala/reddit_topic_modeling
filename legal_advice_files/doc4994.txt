 My SO had a falling out with a friend, what appears to be in spite of my SO decided to use her first name, spelled the same way, as her porn name. The ex friend is making money off this and is under an agency. We have messages from acquaintances claiming that the name was chosen to spite my SO. Can we pursue any legal action? thanks for the legal advice My SO basically feels like her name is being drug through the mud, from someone who is using her name solely for this purpose. I do see how generally there is no real reason that the friend wouldn't be able to use a pretty common name as a stage name, but we also felt like there could be a possibility to take some action if the intent of the name is being used to target my SO so what do you think is illegal? or even remotely wrong?  correct and she is only uses the person's first name? It is a fairly common name is the name fairly common, such as Amber? Or is it an extremely rare name? It's unlikely you'd get anywhere, a.) as she's only using the same first name, b.) courts tend to not want to get involved unless there's actual impersonation, rather than just campy similarity. Which is why there was porn for Nailin' Paylin that didn't get sued into oblivion. No she is not a pornstar herself Is your SO a pornstar who has been using her first name as her porn stage name before her ex-friend started doing it? If not, then any legal action is probably not going anywhere.  No way names are not trade marked yet...  Your SO doesn't have any legal right to be the only person who has that name so no.  This is one of those situations where the Streisand effect may be worth considering.
