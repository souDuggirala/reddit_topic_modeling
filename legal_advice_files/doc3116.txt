 Hello All, My Fiance was adopted from Eastern Europe as a child to the USA in the early 2000's. Her (adoptive) parents pulled her aside at a holiday party this year and told her about a Trust fund that was setup. Now she is 25 and hit some type of milestone that would entitle her to a portion of said trust. Near the end of the holiday party she was handed a personal check for $1,500 with a note in the memo (trust fund). Not to look a gift horse in the mouth but this seems shady so we've decided to hold onto the check and doing more research. My fear is this could be a legal loophole to avoid giving her the proper amount. This family is well off and told her not to mention it to her 2 younger brothers who were adopted with her and supposedly also have Adoption Trusts in place. Considering a trust is expensive to setup and most likely involves lawyers, I am just not comfortable with a personal check for essentially what is 1 months income for her. Thanks in advance Trust beneficiaries are usually entitled to know both (a) a full accounting of the contents of the trust and (b) a copy of the trust documents. outlining when disbursements can be made. I would ask - politely, at first - for them to give you that information. Down the road you could legally escalate, but obviously that carries big risks. We weren't sure where to start, but that sound good. Why doesn't she just ask about the trust and its terms?
