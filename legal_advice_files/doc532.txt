 My son is 8 years old but my husband and I still don't have a will. I'm so afraid for his future if anything happens for us! I think the problem is my husband and I are both pretty introverted. We've moved a lot and don't have many friends to ask for local recommendations. Usually I'm really good at researching things online, but I have no idea how to find a decent lawyer to help us with a will. What are resources to find good, decent lawyers who will be comprehensive? What should I be looking for? I would really appreciate some advice on how to find a trustworthy lawyer for this. tia [The New Jersey Bar Association referral service. ](=2011)
