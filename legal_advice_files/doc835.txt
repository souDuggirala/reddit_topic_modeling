 I attempted to purchase a set of rare wheels from across the U.S. through classifieds on a reputable forum site. I asked for some time stamps and pictures for proof of his ownership of the wheels. Thinking all was clear, he asked for a direct bank transfer. I was very uncomfortable, but man I wanted those wheels, so I went through with it. After I transferred him nearly $2000 of my hard earned money, I reverse image searched his time stamp pictures only to find out that they were photoshopped. How could I be so stupid? I opened a fraud case with my bank but I'm out of luck because I authorized the transfer, regardless of the receiver's intent. That's fine, bank transfers aren't designed for paying for goods. I have the scammer's bank account info and location. I'm at a loss of what to do next. I know it was a stupid decision. I never thought in a million years this would happen to me. It has taught me to trust people less, that's for sure. Any help is greatly appreciated. Cheers, Blue Contact the police, and FBI. If this is an isolated incident, the FBI is unlikely to investigate, but they will have a record of this if this person is a serial scammer. You can take this person to small claims court, but I speculate you will have difficulty collecting on any judgement you obtain against this person. You would need to file any small claims case in a court that has jurisdiction over the person (likely in NC, assuming he lives there or has property there). Call the police in his area and report it. There's a chance they may shake him down.  You can report it to various groups. It is technically interstate wire fraud so the FBI may have jurisdiction- but likely not going to bother with that dollar amount.  Report it here: []() []() It hit home harder the second time, tbf.  You got screwed You can say that again.  You got screwed
