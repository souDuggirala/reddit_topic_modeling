 I have found reference in articles and news stories that it is something like 30 or so states that have systems to reinstate firearms rights to those who have been involuntarily committed. However, I am having difficulty finding a list or resource that lists all of these states. Does anyone know which states currently have a system for reinstating firearms rights for these individuals? Thanks! No I don't intend on lying, that's why im seeking to know in which states I can be honest with them about my history and appeal it in front of a judge or court. I want to make sure I'm filling out the 4473 properly and legally Um, are you Canadian? How would they know that you have been committed in Canada?. BTW lying on a federal form is highly illegal so i don't recommend doing it. On the PDF WARNING [form]() itself you can read the explanation of the question about involuntary commitments
