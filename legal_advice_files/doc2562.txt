 Ohio My ex and I have a 5yo. The child has the father's name, but I want to change it to my last name. The father has agreed. We had a dissolution and agreed on the child support amount together. Once the name change is finalized we would like the support order to end. Is it possible to terminate a support order before the child is 18 if both parties agree?   Child support is owed for the benefit of the child. The parents generally can't change that. And a judge is not going to change a support order unless he or she believes doing so is either consistent with state law or otherwise in the best interest of the child. There really isn't an argument that having less financial support is in the interest of the child.
