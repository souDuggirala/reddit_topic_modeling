 In british columbia, canada child tax benefit usually goes to the female, or the person overseeing the daily activities. My wife is not the best at allocating money and we have been talking about it. Can I, the male- who works still be eligible to accept the child tax benefit? Shes already working on not spending as much. But Im curious whether sheâ€™ll have to buckle up or if I can claim it instead If the two of you are in agreement that you should receive the money and handle it why not simply file and claim as is expected, with the understanding that when the money comes in she will turn it over to you? Either the two of you are in agreement over this or you are not and handling it as an internal family matter would be your best option.
