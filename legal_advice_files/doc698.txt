 Hey, so on June 01, 2017 when I was in San Diego for a weekend with some friends I was involved in a accident at the beach where I fell off a cliff and broke my neck, my back, elbow, ribs, pelvis, collapsed lung...it was a really bad accident and I'm lucky to be alive and in good health now and able to walk. I was in the hospital for about 2 weeks before being transferred back to Canada via an air ambulance. I did have insurance but last October a year and a half after the accident my insurance provider has wrote me a letter saying my claim is denied due to some substances in my blood from the night before. I may have a case against the insurance company first but if all else fails and I'm left with the bill roughly $250,000 usd which I certainly will not be able to pay in my lifetime. I know bankruptcy is an option I'm just wonder what other options I have or how it can affect me up in Canada? I know it's not good and I can't ignore this but I still haven't received a bill from the hospital and it's getting close to 2 years from the accident I'm not even sure how much information the hospital has of mine besides my name really I was so drugged up the whole time I was in hospital and don't remember signing anything or providing much information I know my father gave them his address but nothing's ever been sent. Any information or help on what I should start with if I receive the bill that will help my situation is greatly appreciated and thanks in advance this has been stressing me out for a very long time now.  Try /r/insurance and /r/personalfinance -- both are good with this sort of thing.
