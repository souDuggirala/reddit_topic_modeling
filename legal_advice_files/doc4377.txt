 Hello everyone. I got in a parking lot accident in August but in a family friend's car (they're from Virginia). It was my fault. The person who was involved has hired an injury lawyer since and I received a letter from his lawyer a few weeks ago that he is claiming damages for physical injuries. Again, a parking accident and he was totally fine for months (August to October) so I am skeptical. My insurance company does not cover it because it was not my car and I can't get in touch with the family friend for their policy number. I am 18 years old, go to school, and have no income living off of OSAP. If I do end up going to court, what is the likely result?  My income covers rent along with student loans. Thanks. What is the likelihood of a judgement against me? How does one find out they have injuries 2 months later from a minor parking accident? You said you had no income. If you have any income your wages may be garnished in accordance with a court order. No need to be rude. I'm a student working part-time living on my own. I guess it'll follow me until I get a source of income.  Getting a job would be a good start. If they get a judgement against you then you're going to end up paying it at some point.  That's proving to be difficult. How would I pay out of pocket if I'm broke? As long as the friend's insurance covers permissive use that policy should cover you so you need to get in touch with them. If not then you're going to end up paying out of pocket.
