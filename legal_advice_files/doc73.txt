 Title says it all tbh. Confused as to why it showed up in the first place if it's supposed to be gone when I hit 18. What can I do about this? Hmm, not sure why they would have access to juvenile records. Read that link...I would at the very least request further info about who is reporting that information. I applied for a nursing home job, the archdiocese of st. Louis runs the nursing home. I guess that's why. Not all background checks are created equal. Are you applying for a job with the government or government contractor? Police/FBI and prosecutors, for example, can still see juvenile records when running a check. I think they can also see expunged records, too. Note: You have a right to certain information if they use it against you--request a copy from them so you can see what is reporting.
