Not sure this is the right sub, but I'm not a reddit expert. My mom died in March, and I'm using her old car to commute to college. The registration ran out in July (which I learned by getting pulled over, whoops) and my dad said he'd register it. He, however, can't seem to, he says he has to pay the car off beforehand, so it can be in his name. Is he right? What can we do if he is right? What can we do if he's wrong? Thanks for any advice you can give.  Nop a Lawyer. Normally, the car and the loan would be transferable via Probate to the new owner, who would then take over payments on the Loan and have a new title and registration done without paying it off. It sounds like that wasn't done. Depending on how much is left on the car, a Probate Attorney might get it moved around way cheaper than paying it off. You should be able to get a cheap ($50-$150) or free consult to see if it's going to be possible and how much work would be involved.
