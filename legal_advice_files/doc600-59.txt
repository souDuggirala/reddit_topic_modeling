I work on data recovery for local private investigators in the U.S. I am currently working with an investigator researching assets of one party in a divorce. Through an insane level of coincidence, I bought some computers off the FB marketplace that apparently belonged to the target's largest customer. This data seems to include receipts and invoices that were hidden in the original data batch I was given. 

My questions are, is it legal to use this little nugget of data, and who owns the data when you purchase a used computer? This is a highly nuanced question that touches on too many areas of law to answer here, My advise (practical advice, not legal advice) would be to alert the divorce attorney that retained you or your company to do the investigation, and ask them how to proceed.  For the data to be useful in court, the lawyers will need to do some work to establish it is what it seems to be, and they should be able to provide you with guidance.
