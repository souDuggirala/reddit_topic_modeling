 Burglary of a dwelling and stealing an item worth $750 to 50k in value, which are F6 and F4. prior for possession of marijuana that has not yet been settled, plus probation for the same thing when I was a minor that I just finished probation for about a month ago. How fucked am I? Will I be able to plead to a misdemeanor? How much jail time in your experience? I know it's 2-12 years for a level 4 felony. Will all my priors affect this? I also snitched on someone but they didn't offer me anything I was just afraid and panicked. The legal process takes a long time so I just want some clarity on how royally fucked I am. I would imagine once OP gets an attorney, OP will be instructed to delete this post, too. You need to get an attorney. No one can guess what deals can be made in your particular circumstances. Your priors will factor in. You may spend some time incarcerated.
