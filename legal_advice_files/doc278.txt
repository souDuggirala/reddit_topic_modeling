  There have been heavy rain in the Los Angeles area. My parents living in a duplex on the first floor and the Landlord lives on the second floor. My living room flooring is this white with baby blue pattern tile. My mom was walking in the living room and slipped on a pool of water that formed from a leak in the wall next to the entrance. Due to the color of the flooring and the light, she did not see the water. As a result, she now has a bruised/scraped chin and is complaining that her side hurts. I do not currently live with my parents but have been receiving information from my siblings. According to them, our Landlord has sent out a general contractor that previously installed a new exterior door to our living room. They did not get the name of the company down but it sounds like he is not experienced in solving leaks. So far he has been on the roof and has not been able to do a complete repair due to the constant rain. I believe the wall needs to be ripped apart to investigate if the leak is coming from a crack on the wall instead of the roof. The wall is soft and mushy. Water is still constantly pooling and the living room is not usable at this point. We've requested a copy of our lease and the Landlord said she'll give us a copy later this week. So my questions are: 1. Is there any recourse if my mom requires medical attention? 2. Are we allowed rent credit since we are not able to use the living room? 3. Is the Landlord suppose to alleviate the leak situation? Like provide some type of pads or flooring that would absorb excess water? 4. Is there anything else I am missing that I should be asking? Thanks for your help and guidance.  The leak/water is not coming from the ceiling but through the wall. The bottom area, around 2 feet from the floor is where the wall is very damp and soft. I don't think a bucket will work with collecting the water.  In the immediate, can you not put a bucket down?
