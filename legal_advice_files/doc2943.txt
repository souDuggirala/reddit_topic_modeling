 Don’t take my username too seriously, I’m not a pedophile. I just want to know if I should report this or not. a server for adults discussing their fetishes, sharing sexual content, etc, regardless of whether there are images containing nudity, is not an appropriate environment for minors. it is dangerous for them and its exactly the kind of situation that pedophiles will and often do take advantage of, and unless this server was created recently i would be surprised if something like that hasnt already happened. get the authorities involved. the server needs a 18+ only policy and if it cant or wont enforce one then it needs to be taken down. All your other posts suggest you’re a sick fuck
