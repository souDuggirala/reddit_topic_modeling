 Hypothetically, let's say a person with a SC license plate got a parking ticket in GA and all info on the ticket was correct except the license plate state. Does the person who got that ticket still have to pay it even though the officer put the wrong license plate state on the ticket? The ticket is not handwritten but is a printout from a portable printer so the officer probably entered it with the wrong state into their system.
