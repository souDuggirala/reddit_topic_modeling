 Location: Washington State So a bit of backstory first: This past Saturday me and my mom and siblings were at a skating rink in the mall. I was off the ice and eating Cinnabon and after a while I see a body on the ground with some blood next to it and it turns out it was my mom. She fell while she was skating and she was bleeding from her head on the ice. I rushed to her and some of the staff and thankfully a nurse was on site. They called 911 and she was treated and everything turned out fine, no broken anything. Thing is, my mom said that she doesn’t remember falling down and hitting her head. There weren’t many people on the ice and I don’t think there was any foul play involved, but she wanted to pull some video footage from when she fell. Reddit, do you think I would be she would be able to get the video? I see, thank you for your answer. :) You can ask. They’ll probably tell you no.  Sure if you file a lawsuit and get a subpoena, assuming it hasn't been "lost". Otherwise probably not. The owners of the footage are not likely going to voluntarily turn over something that could be used to sue them.
