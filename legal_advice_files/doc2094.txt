 I’m traveling from Virginia to Texas. I need to take it to my moms house because I’m moving outa country. Can I get in trouble? Also if i stay at a hotel and put it back together but keep it next to the bed in my room (im paranoid) is this ok? I was just correcting the post above me! I'd personally do what you're doing - locked in the trunk, and then taken into the hotel at night.  Nah I’m just gana take it but keep it in the truck or locked up like a few others suggested. Feel like shipping would be costly and I sleep better with it. Good to know tho :) If you're shipping it, you don't have to send it FROM an FFL, just TO one. Also USPS won't accept handguns, and you have to declare them to private carriers. Keep it locked up in the trunk (assembled) is fine. You can not conceal it on your person and there are few spots you can not have it in your vehicle depending on the type of permit you carry. Keeping it in your trunk with the ammunition in a separate container is safe and allowed. This is a satisfying answer thanks and yup over 21.  Keep it unloaded in a locked case in the trunk. I assume your over 21? Yes, you can have it loaded in a hotel room you're staying in. Sooo is it legal? How else would someone transport fire arms. The gun store guy had told me al long as it’s not accessible it’s fine. Didn’t really answer my question but that’s a great idea.  If you need to find an ffl dealership in your area to send it to texas to another ffl dealer in your moms area. That way you dont run the risk.
