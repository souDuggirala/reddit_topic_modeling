 So I recently bought a pair of air pods off a guy on Kijiji, he sold them at a relatively good price. It's been around a week now after I got them, and I texted him to ask about how old they are and now he's told me he found them when he was walking his dog deep into a gravel trail. I was able to do a serial number lookup, and it seems like they're only around a month old. It says there is still a warranty active. The fact that whoever bought them hasn't come to look for them or anything makes me guess they haven't registered them? They have been paired and reset a couple more times after that as well. I really don't know what to do here though. While it sucks they lost their air pods, I have also just spent my money on them and can't return them to the seller.
