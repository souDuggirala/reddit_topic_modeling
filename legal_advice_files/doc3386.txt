 (MN) I was unaware of this, but apparently my tabs expired last month and I went outside to find my car missing today. The property manager or someone at the rental office had it done. It's close to 300 dollars to get it out. Do I have any recourse? It's stipulated in the lease, now that I look, but there's also some business here about 90 days: []()  're in the right. How? The statute you linked to does not apply to private property. Your lease controls here.
