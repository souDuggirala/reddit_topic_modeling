  I’ll try to keep it short since I’m stressed as Fuck right now. I recently got scammed at a club and just today met with a lawyer who’s dealt with this and says we can sue for fraud and at the most get half off the charges back. When I called my credit card company earlier this week and explained it to them they said they cannot consider this fraud. If I succeed in court and get half my money back can I dispute the remainder with the credit company afterwards and get the other half back since it was proven to be fraud ?
