 I recently created a viable product that I would like to eventually sell in a commercial format. It requires a canister/jar with a lid in order to contain its contents. I found a glass jar that works perfectly with my product. There are no logos, labels, or genuinely unique aspects of the jar. The jar itself does not have any noticeable markings on it outside of a small, simple, unique, circular pattern on the base bottom. The jar itself appears to have been manufactured in China. The product, in its finished state, has a label, paint on the jar, and a bit of twine. I adhere a stick-on label with a logo, UPC, description, etc. onto the jar. The only noticeable or unique factor of this jar is the base. I'm a one-man shop. I am looking to sell my product mostly online through Etsy or an e-commerce site, maybe Amazon one day. I've only given it to people to try, I haven't sold it yet (so far, people love it!). My goal would be to begin selling it online soon. If I sell my product in this glass jar, could I be sued by the company who produces the jar? Do grape/strawberry jam manufacturers have to order/create unique jars?
