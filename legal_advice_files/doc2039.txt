 I’m staying in an airbnb for a month in Massachusetts, and I had a friend over for the day and he streamed a movie using a hosting website. I stopped him the moment I noticed but he was already 40 minutes in, now I’ve heard of people getting kicked out of their airbnb for torrenting but Will this also apply for streaming? Not exactly the same situation. In cases of torrenting, the owner of the internet account will get an email that torrenting was done from their Network. Its easy for copyright holders to get that info, they just have to join in with the uploaders and they can see anyone who is uploading or downloading their content. While streaming has similar legality, it would be massively, massively harder for a copyright holder to find out who had watched their content on an unapproved website. I've personally never heard of this being done. In any case, unless this is a long term rental, there's effectively no way for the copyright holder to find out you or your friend streamed their movie before the end of your stay. Streaming is downloading dude... Odds are, your Airbnb house owner will not notice  I mean the thing is in most places watching a stream of copyrighted material isn’t illegal, hosting/publishing it is. Most of the time no one cares what movies or shows you stream (NOT download), air b b or no. Best of luck.
