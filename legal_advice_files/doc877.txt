 # Ontario, Canada: My 2013 BMW 328xi was parked outside my shop in a parking lot yesterday January 29th, 2019. During this day there was a large snowstorm in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) that caused very dangerous driving conditions. At the end of the day, I noticed that my rear bumper had been cracked along with various scrapes and scratches on the back of the car. I'd estimate that the cost would just be under $5000, qualifying for small claims court. At first, I had not known what had happened and who had hit my car. After asking around, I now have surveillance footage thanks to my neighbor that shows a FedEx delivery truck rear-ending my bumper, stopping for a couple seconds, then reversing and continuing on to his route. In the video also shows another one of my neighbors who was shoveling her parking lot and then running to chase the truck. I've talked to her and she has gladly agreed to vouch for me. My question now is, how do I go about this situation. I know there is currently a lot of buzz going around most delivery companies with the way they poorly handle fragile packages by recklessly throwing them during their delivery route. Is it a good idea to post the video to the internet and to news channels and possibly make this into some sort of viral case? Should I contact FedEx and tell them about the evidence I have, then what possible compensation can I receive? Or finally, should I present this to the authorities and let them handle this for me? What solution would be best to receive the best outcome?  No, you should not post this on the news. Simply contact Fedex and tell them their driver hit your car, and that you have video which should make their investigation easy. As for compensation, you are entitled to have your car repaired.  I agree--OP is making this out as some kind of payday against FedEx, but this won't be that different than any other fender bender.  Just contact FedEx and open an insurance claim. This happens all the time.
