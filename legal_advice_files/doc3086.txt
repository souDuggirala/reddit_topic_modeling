 I lived in Massachusetts during high school, and moved to Kentucky to be nearer to family after high school. I've recently been attending college full time in Missouri, so I've had no need to change my residency. Now I'm looking to move back to Massachusetts and go to school part time while working part/full time. In order to "live" and work in Massachusetts while be a part time student, do I need to reobtain my Massachusetts residency?  I don't live in a city so I think I'll be good, only parking pass I'll need is the campus parking pass If you're going to be living in Boston (and some other MA cities), you can only get an on-street parking permit if your car is registered to an address in the permit area. Thank you for the help! I'd argue that yes, it does. But I'm not the government in Massachusetts. Contact the DMV and ask for a clarification on this matter. Students who don't reside continually in the state are generally exempt, but there seem to be nuances in Massachusetts, which were outlined in the link I provided.  I would be in Massachusetts for more than 183 days of the year but and in Kentucky for summers. But it states that I must maintain a permanent place of abode and be in state for more than 183 days, but that "a dwelling place that is maintained only during a temporary stay in Massachusetts for the accomplishment of a particular documented purpose. A temporary stay is defined as a predetermined period of time not to exceed one year." So my question is does going to school part time count as a" particular documented purpose" Edit: I'd be staying with family in Massachusetts so off campus  Will you be living at the dorm or off-campus? If you live off-campus longer than 183 days of the year, you need to change your residency. [Source]()
