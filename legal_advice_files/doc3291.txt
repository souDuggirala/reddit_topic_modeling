 I've had an agency called Ontario County Stop DUI in Upstate NY try to contact me by certified mail in an attempt to collect a fine from 22 years ago. In 1996, I was indigent, had two broken feet, and did not work while on probation. She asked me my officer's name. I didn't answer her, I think that was this woman trying to get me to confirm I was who they're hunting. She's claiming a warrant will be filed if I don't pay them $1500.00. I'm not sure she's telling me the truth, in fact, this just feels like more of me being convicted over and over for things I've already paid for. She says they're a collection agency... Shouldn't they have already sent this to my credit report? It would've been charged off by now. I was told that because I wasn't working I wasn't liable for fees or fines. But now here I am, being hassled by yet another state I don't live in. I was indeed on probation prior to moving to Nashville, but it was in Monroe County, not Ontario. And I was released from probation, I owed them nothing. Isn't there some limit on how long a state can harrass me? This is a link to their website, the woman I contacted, Suzanne Cirencione, is pictures on that site, and her Facebook page is wide open to the public. That's how I contacted her. Have I now been served because I spoke to her? I don't want to have a warrant hanging over my head. What do I do? [removed] No, you cannot be served over Facebook lol youâ€™re fine. Wife does this for a living and not over the internet  Blockity block Block and move on. Sounds like a scam. Facebook is not a legitimate channel for conducting legal correspondence.
