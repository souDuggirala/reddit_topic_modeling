 About three months ago my boyfriend, roommate, and I hosted a party. At the time all people involved were under 21 but over 18. A small amount of alcohol and marijuana was present. My Friend (19F) took off her shirt and bra, applied stickers to cover her nipples and asked my boyfriend to take a picture. He did. After the party he deleted them without being asked. Today she sent me a text saying she was considering legal action. Is her clear consent still valid if she was slightly intoxicated? Is anyone in legal danger? Thank you for your response. Thank you. No one is in any legal danger. Sheâ€™s just regretting her choices.  What a mad tart. There was no law broken there that I am aware of.
