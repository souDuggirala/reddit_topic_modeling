 I just received a ticket on the belt parkway in NYC. I was doing 73 in a 50, it's my fault I'll admit to it I didn't know what the speed limit was. It's a $200 dollar fine and my record is clear of speeding violations I think (had quite a few when I was younger) but as far as I know all that's on my record is an accident I had around 4yrs ago, I slid in the snow at an intersection. Anyway I'm from California and my wife is freaking out about insurance going up and all of that jazz. Should I just pay the fine and be on my way or what? There's no way I'll be able to fight this as I'm going back home on the 2nd. No idea in NYC. Probably expensive. Do you know how much an attorney typically runs for this? I might do this, it's been 7yrs since I've had any violations except the accident but when I was younger I was getting around 2 a year, so I've been through this many times before, just figured I'd see if there's anything I could possibly do. Nal, I got pulled over for something similar, seeing as how you admit to going well over the speed limit. I would go to the court house and just pay the 200$ bill and it's all done. That's what I did and never heard from it again.  In my instance, I was speeding in Wyoming. I’m from ca. I was told to wait for a letter from them. I can go there to contest the ticket, or pay the fine. I haven’t had a moving violation in decades, at the time. Eventually, the letter came and I mailed a check for the fine. Some time later, I checked with My insurance company to see if the saw end thing on their end. And she said nope, and if that’s your only point in a long time it wouldn’t affect anything. It didn’t. You could hire an attorney, he might be able to eliminate any points on your license depending on the violation.
