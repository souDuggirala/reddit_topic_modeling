 My ex is a pedophile who escaped prosecution. My kids and I moved out of state and have no contact. I just heard that on a couple of occasions my adult daughter's friends and their parents have seen him in the store or wherever, and they've gone up to him and said things like, "Hi, do you remember me? I'm \\\'s friend! Do you ever wonder how your kids are doing? Are you abusing your new stepdaughter like you abused your kids?" They said he won't speak to them, just turns around and walks away. A couple times they followed him and kept it up until he left the store. While I appreciate that they're sticking it to him and letting him know that we might be out of his life but people in his town think he's a dirtbag, I worry that he might be able to retaliate if it happens too often. Could he go after them for harassment?
