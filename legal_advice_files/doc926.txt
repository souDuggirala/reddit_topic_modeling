 So today at school, (I'm in 7th grade) I was in class and there was a substitute. I was with my friends and one of the students came and started pressing scissors into my arm. My friends pulled his arm away? Is this illegal? Am I over exaggerating by posting this here. After that, he ganged up on me with another student and was going to hurt me with the scissors, so I ran around screaming and they grabbed me and tried to choke me and started pushing my head into a cabinet. I have no injuries besides the cut on where he pressed the point of the scissors.  Oh ok Well there you go. The school will decide what the appropriate response will be.  Oh Aggravated assault is a pretty serious crime and most schools have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to violence. They will probably be risking expulsion. I didn't tell him. I told my mom, shes going to tell the office And when you went to the sub and said "hey, these guys cut me with scissors and choked me, and pushed my head into a cabinet" what did he or she say? You should tell your teacher and your parents.
