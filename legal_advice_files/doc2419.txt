 So I am 19 and last night I was driving home after buying some weed. The cops had set up a check point and the cop smelt the weed so he stopped me. He asked me to be honest with him so I gave him the weed, which was about 24 grams, and he searched me and the car. I also had a little over 200 cash in my center console and a very realistic airsoft pistol in the trunk. He said since I was honest with him he was going to let me go with only a possession charge and he gave me a ticket and let me go after. I am in Virginia and this is my first ever charge other then a speeding ticket. So I plan on getting the state appointed lawyer and pleading guilty but going for a first offender program. I just have a few questions.
