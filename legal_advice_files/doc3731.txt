 I overdosed in my house 3 years ago and the cops came and arrested me for intent to distribute because i had my drugs laying out on my bed. I got bailed out after 45 days. I still haven't been arraigned. The only time I went to court was for my bond hearing. Since I got out I haven't received any mail or anything relating to it. BUT.. my mom was arrested by the same cop that arrested me (I live in a small town). He thought she was me and said to her "i bet youre glad all those drug charges were dropped." After some confusion they figured out he was talking about my arrest. He told her that the evidence was gone and they were dropping them. I thought that sounded too good to be true so I called the court house and they said the charges are still pending so I have a lot of doubt that I got that lucky. I'm not sure if I'm even posting in the right place. If I'm not please direct me to the right subreddit. I'm mostly wondering if there's a time limit that I have to have been arraigned by and and am also wondering if maybe the charges are still pending because I have to have a court date to have them officially dropped.  The officer may have been trying to fool the person he thought was you into confessing. Perhaps he thought she would make some statement of relief which would serve as an admission. Police are allowed to do such things.
