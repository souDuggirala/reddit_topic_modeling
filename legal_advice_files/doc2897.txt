 Throwaway for obvious reasons. In March of 2014 an old friend from high school came to the town I was living in. We had graduated 7 years prior and were friends on social media I reached out to hang out with my roommate(who she also knew from school) and I. I was making a good living and paid for the drinks. Too many drinks. We got drunk. She said something about not wanting to call her ride to pick her up so I offered her our place to crash. My room way nearest the restroom so I offered my room. After she fell asleep I left. I went and met another friend. I returned home after a couple hours and had forgotten she was even at my house. I went into my bathroom and to my surprise she was in there. I walked her to my room as I was putting her on the bed she pulled me down with her. We started kissing. We were both still drunk. Eventually I went down on her and penetrated her with my fingers. That’s it. Nothing else. Once we woke up we realized what had happened. I was so drunk I hadn’t realized I fingered her with a tampon in her. I apologized and she promptly called a ride. I apologized again later that week. She reached out this past October but what she said seemed like a joke. Still I apologized. A lot told her how that’s not the person I am. I made a mistake. She blew me off which I understood. She reached out again last month saying I was welcome to pay any part of the $4,000 she has spend on birth control, anti depressants, and therapy. I was not going to respond. Today she said it wasn’t a joke. I again apologized. Told her I didn’t have the means to pay. She said she wants closure but her next course of action is filing a police report. I understand this is serious and I’m a piece of shit for what happened that night but what recourse do I have? And if contacted by police, shut up and get a lawyer. TL;DR $4000 over drunken sex 5 years ago Ignore. Move on.
