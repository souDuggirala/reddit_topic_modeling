 My ex fiancé is currently doing a year stint in county jail, and he’s already completed 4 months of his sentence and I was just wondering what are all the possible legal ways to get him released early. Good behavior is out of the question because he’s already been in solitary. They won’t let him do the ged program either. And if it’s not possible is there a way around how expensive it is to put time on their calling cards? Here in Florida it’s super expensive. No and no. You get out early by behaving and getting good time. Unless the jail gets overcrowded they are t going to let him out early.
