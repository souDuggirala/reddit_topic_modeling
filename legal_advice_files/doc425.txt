  I have been working for a small startup company, in which I am the only person whose work is billable to insurance, therefore I am the only source of income (to my knowledge) at this time. My employer has bounced 4 checks to me at this time, causing my bank to flag my account. The employed has been able to pay me in cash about Â¼ of the amount I am owed for my work over the past 2 months. They are still 6 weeks behind in payments to me. I have been staying because I need the experience, but obviously getting paid is a huge priority for me. How should I proceed to get the money owed me without jeopardizing my ability to work?  You are wasting your own time there if you are not paid for your work. File a wage claim. If they are bouncing checks, especially payroll, they are almost certainly about to close shop. Your startup is going titsup. Time to get out and file a wage claim.  What is your state?
