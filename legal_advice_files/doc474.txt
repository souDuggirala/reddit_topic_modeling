 So today I picked up a second ticket in a 30 day period. It was for speeding going 44 in a 25. One issue I have is the cop marked it as going 20-24 over which doubles the fine. The other ticket was for an illegal left turn. Im wondering how bad this will affect my issuance rates. My court date for both is in 2 weeks. I have a probationary license as well is that changes it. If you're a 17 year old, male, and have this on record, your insurance is going to be crazy. You should ask your parents to get you a traffic attorney to see if they can minimize damage from this.  It's going to destroy your insurance rates. It's in your best interest to have your parents retain an attorney and do their best to mitigate damages. Your rates will certainly go up. For a 17 year old driver it will probably be significant. You can try hiring a traffic attorney to contest the charges, it may or may not help depending on details that your local traffic attorney will be better equipped to determine than the internet, but it is likely to be worth looking into because of the impact this could have on your license and insurance. In the future, drive safely and obey traffic laws and you will not have this problem.
