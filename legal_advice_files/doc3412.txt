 I sold my car about 3 weeks ago, the guy came from tulsa, OK to missouri. we both signed a bill, and i got the cash for the car and turned over the title. I didn’t even think about it at the time but i ripped of the bottom of the title, the “notice of sale” and he didnt fill it out. Ive reached out to him multiple times to try and get the info from him to put on there, but he just won’t tell me and i have no idea why. What are the consequences of not turning that in? On the paper it says it needs to be turned in within 30 days of sale, and if not its a misdemeanor if you don’t or if you provide false info. Is this actually true and will I get in trouble if I dont turn it in, or is it not really a big deal?
