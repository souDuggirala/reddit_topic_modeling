 Hi folks, I'll provide a small bit of backstory to explain the situation. There is a popular multiplayer video game. In this video game there is a wave-based challenge that is desirable to beat. As you beat each wave the challenge gets progressively harder, with the final waves being extremely difficult. If you die, you must start at wave 1. Getting to the end waves takes 2-3 hours and one mistake can mess it all up. To help players I have been working on a program that simulates these end waves. Players can choose which wave they would like to practice and do it as much as they like. My program does not use any of their assets or IP. Every image, model, and line of code was written by me; but my question is does this still violate copyright law because it is similar? It is intentionally designed to look and feel like their game obviously. If this does potentially violate copyright law, is there a difference if I do not sell this program and release it for free? Finally, am I allowed to call my program "&lt;Challenge Name "? The challenge name is generic and not copyrighted, but obviously falls under their IP. I would be happy to learn about this myself If anyone is knowledgeable of where to find this information. I reside in Canada, and their company is based in the UK (If jurisdiction matters). Still a couple months from finishing the project, but I want to get all my facts straight before I do anything. Thank you for any help you can provide &lt;3 Your post has not been removed.
