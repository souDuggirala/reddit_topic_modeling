 California small claims. So I won a small claims verdict. Did a debtor examination and the debtor was a noshow. They put out a pending warrant and a new trial date and he shows up. We are now at a point for another debtor examination. He doesnt show up and I ask the judge for a warrant this time because its a pattern. She tells me she cant issue a warrant now but would issue a pending warrant. Then she tells me I have to pay to have him served with the pending warrant. I questioned her on this and she told me i could add the money to my settlement but this made no sense to me. At that point I left the court with no answers and called the small claims court self help. They told me they have no idea about anyone ever having to do this and that pending warrants are handled by the court which I totally agreed with. Went back to the court to inquire about this and the small claims cashier again had no clue of any defendant ever having to serve a defendant a pending warrant. Honestly if I have to serve him I am going to wait until the last possible moment to do it. Has anyone ever heard of this and at this point I have no idea who to even talk to about this. They sent me the form I need to sign and have him served with but again why am I the one to serve him. To have to pay when I've already served him once.
