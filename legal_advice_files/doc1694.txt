 Hello Guys, I’m wondering if I could get some help/advice on a certain civil forfeiture I’m going to be dealing with against the government because they unlawfully took over $5,000 out of my house during a swat investigation and assumed the money was the “accused” when it was actually my innocent parents/sister who had no acknowledgement of any of the unlawful activities going on with the “accused” the money was found in my parents room not even near the “accused” room. They said theres traces of drugs but the money came back from the bank so it makes no sense, and one portion of it was my sisters from her waitressing job (tips) My case is coming up if there are any laws and or cases you can help me to use to represent myself would be great. Lets get some justice Thanks!  [removed] Okay, that sort of helps. I just realized you said you were in Canada. I know zero about asset forfeiture in your country. If you can't afford representation, and the money was legitimately obtained, I'd suggest looking for some kind of legal aid organization to help.  It’s obviously unlawfully when the accused does live in the house but doesn’t have access to where the money was placed (half of it was locked up in a suitcase in my parents home and the other was in my sisters room with her tips) they shouldn’t have been allowed to take the money we rightfully earned and another thing my tips weren’t taken which is weird. I’m not the accused that is a relative of mine and my parents/sister are going through with it now but we are going to represent ourselves.   What makes you think it was unlawful? It sounds like you're aware of what civil asset forfeiture is and how absurd it is. If it wasn't your money, what case are you talking about? Are you the ""accused""? If your parents and sister want to contest the forfeiture, they can do so. Since it wasn't your money, you're not involved. While it's not clear what case you're talking about (see above), it's unwise to go pro se.
