This happened the 8th of November this year in Chicago, IL.

Basically had this person turn out in front of me while she was making a left turn causing me to run into her. I was going straight and had a solid green. One of the first things she said to me was that she was uninsured. This is especially bad because I only have comprehensive coverage and am not covered for accidents with uninsured motorists. Police came and the whole nine yards. Police determined it was her fault right there on the scene, though I wasn't a part of that conversation. I pulled the police report and it shows that she got two tickets, I'm not sure what for. I haven't had any contact with her since the accident. 

I have two main questions. First, I want to reach out to her to see if she'll settle this out of court. I don't really want to go to court, I much rather just take the cash to cover my repairs. (I haven't had the car repaired yet, can't really afford it on my own). Is there a particular way I should word my message to her to avoid trouble down the line should I have to take her to court? I know not to threaten her with court or anything like that, I just want to see if she's even willing to cooperate with me. Second, do I need to appear at her court dates for the tickets she gotten? If I don't show up is she just off the hook for the whole thing? If that's the case I'll definitely go but I don't want to if I don't have to, as I'd have to take of from work. Thanks a bunch in advance for any advice you can give me. This is gonna be a tough one. People who don't have insurance are often judgement-proof, so you may not be able to get anything out of her either way, even if you do take her to court.  [removed]
