 Hi Legal Advice, I'm taking a test with a testing center soon. I'm disabled, and am going to need some accommodations, specifically more time. I have documentation, and can provide it, but what the testing center is asking for is really personal intellectual assessments, as well as past medical or academic records. Again, I have all this information, and I understand the testing center wanting to protect their tests, but this seems like a violation of the ADA. Am I wrong here, because none of this is highlighted within their documentation, it just says to plonk your super personal information below. When I was in community college I gave a n iq test and an ard from when I was a child as proof of my dyscalculia. Itâ€™s pretty common practice to be asked for proof. Is this being requested by the testing facility or the [entity administering the exam]()? Is this a standardized test for school admissions (SAT, ACT, MCAT) or some form of licensure? The testers are allowed to ask for "reasonable" documentation of your diagnosis, past accommodations, etc.
