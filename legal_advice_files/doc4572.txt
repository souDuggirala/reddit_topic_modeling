 So i went in to have cavities filled (4) and they quoted me 195 bucks for all 4. So i have the procedure done and pay. I go back for a cleaning and they tell me i still owe 134 dollars. I'm like what?? They quoted me for mercury fillings and gave me the fancy white ones instead. But didnt check with insurance until after the fact to see thats its NOT covered by my plan. I refuse to pay the money because thats not what i was quoted. Nor did i ask for the fancy fillings. Can i do anything about this?  Ok thanks Damn it.  Working in a call center for health insurance, it is your responsibility as the insured, to know how your policy works. You'll be held responsible for the difference  It's on you to make sure your insurance covers procedures you're getting, not the doctor/dentist. Some will check out of the kindness of their hearts, but they're under no legal obligation to. It's up to you to know your insurance policy, know (or find out) what's covered, and approve or deny procedures based upon that information. Whether or not you received the correct fillings is going to come down to whatever you agreed to concerning the procedure. Did you receive any sort of paperwork at the time that listed exactly what you were paying for and how much?
