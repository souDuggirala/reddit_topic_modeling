 So long story short, on Thanksgiving I reserved a unit (paid admin and application fee) for a 2br that was 200-300 cheaper than all other units. Today, the complex called me and said that the posting was a “pricing mistake”, the unit is “undergoing a full renovation”, and it is not available. They said I could be refunded the fees I paid or look at other available units. This was on a phone call. Do I have any recourse or was this just a too good to be true situation and I’m SOL? Location: Atlanta, GA But muh cheap rate   They're willing to make you whole. You have nothing else to ask for or demand here.  Short of a signed and executed lease, you can be refunded the fees or look at other available units. You have no legal mechanism to force them to give you that particular unit at that particular price.
