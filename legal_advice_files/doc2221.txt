 Asking for a friend who needs advice? Unsure of the legality of this whole thing, so here’s what happened. My friend M had her friend A do money transfers for her. (M does a type of sex work and most of her apps have shut down, so J receive’s the money and sends it to J through apps she does have) So a male who wanted to pay M for her “services” sent A a thousand dollars to send to M, and once A received the money they deactivated their accounts and blocked them on everything and disappeared. How much trouble can either be in? My friend M wants to press charges for fraud, however I pointed out to her that what she is doing is also illegal, so could she still press charges and not get in trouble? And would it even be possible to press charges on someone she doesn’t have information on? (She told me she doesn’t know her legal name or where they’re from other than the name she told her). Any information helps, thanks.  I’ll pass that on, thanks  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. M would have to sue A for the money in small claims court in A’s jurisdiction. There are no charges to press or report to be made.
