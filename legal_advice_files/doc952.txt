 3 Years ago (2016), I was stopped at an airport. I accidentally brought in a prohibited item, and had to go to court. My lawyer told me that if I settled, I will have a misdemeanor on my record. I decided to settle due to time constraint, and also based on his advice that it would be difficult to win the case. I recently went to public records to check my criminal record and saw this: Statute 000.00 Unknown statute Conviction Level Converted: Offense Level Unknown Does anyone know what this means? I've checked the internet, but nothing comes up.
