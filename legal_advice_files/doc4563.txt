 If it’s not obvious by the title, there’s a trigger warning for suicide here. I will not be including names in this. My best friend’s nephew shot himself recently. The cops told her and her sister that they didn’t do suicide cleanup and so my best friend was forced to clean up everything that was left behind. I’m in Florida. Is this legal? Does the state/country actually expect the family to have to clean up a loved ones remains after they committed suicide? Was what the police did legal? Yes it is legal. The police don't have to clean up crime scenes, but there are companies that do. Correct. The police are not responsible for cleaning a crime scene. The company ServPro (as well as many others) exist, at least partially, for this very reason. (Excuse my copy -n- paste) There are sevices that will do the cleanup so the homeowner does not have to. "Crime scene cleanup goes beyond cleaning up broken glass - blood and other body fluids, tear gas, or other chemicals can pose significant health and safety risks. In most cases, homeowners insurance policies will cover the cost of remediation services offered by companies like Aftermath. However, this is not a guarantee, and it’s important to check with your insurance adjuster to be sure." There are also some forms of financial assistance to help with this cleanup, including Victims compensation assistance, Discount programs, Payment plans, and Aftermath financial assistance, if eligible
