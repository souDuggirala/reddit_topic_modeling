I work in a daycare, I'm a floater so I will go with many age groups... Well yesterday I was with the two year olds, they don't call the terrible twos for nothing! I left a sharpie on the counter , I thought it was out of reach. It wasn't and the kids had sharpie all over their face and a parent was super upset. Any help?  Nope, you can be fired for that. There is nothing illegal about firing you for failing to properly supervise 2 year olds. [deleted] Do you have a union? Are you in Montana?
