 Hello, A few weeks ago I quit a job I held for four years. I was a salaried exempt employee and was paid on a biweekly schedule. I put in a two weeks notice and worked it gracefully with no ill will. The end of this week will be end the two week pay period AFTER my last day. I know that I am still fully active in their system. I still have their corporate apps on my phone and still can access my work email and the company intranet from my phone unrestricted. I know for a fact that when they terminate you in the system that it will automatically uninstall all of those apps by the device management profile. By policy the system terminations are processed the day the employee leaves the company. I know because I did many of them for my employees. It is to avoid situations like the one I now find myself in. Payroll is pretty much processed automatically. Getting to the point, I know that if they don’t terminate me in their system by Friday I will be paid again next week. Over the last two weeks I have sent 3 emails copying my direct manager, his manager, and the HR department requesting my termination be processed to avoid this headache. I don’t believe it will be done because Thanksgiving week will be very busy for them and everyone will be off Thanksgiving day. Obviously this money shouldn’t belong to me because I was not working for them at all over the course of the pay period. When/If they accidentally pay me, how long do I need to hold this money for? Is there a point at which it becomes mine? Especially after expressing to them in writing that they need to process my termination. I am not sure how long it will be before they get around to terminating me officially as they are shaking up managers currently. I am worried I will fall through the cracks and continue to be paid for the foreseeable future.  Don't spend the money so that when they ask for it back, you can just give it to them. Otherwise, keep notifying them.
