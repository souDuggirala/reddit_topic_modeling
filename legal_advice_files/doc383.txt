 After my court session for a green dui i was given some papers. On one of these papers there’s a “must follow these rules” section. In that section there is a rule that says “do not consume marijuana or any other mind altering drugs not prescribed” with a x in the box next to it. But there is also a rule that says “do not refuse a UA test if ordered by the court/law enforcement” but there’s no x in the box next to it. Does that mean I’m gonna get drug tested? I’m under court supervision until 11/8/19. I kinda miss weed lol  You’re good. Just remember, if you get caught high or with drug paraphernalia, you’ll be violating the conditions of your probation for the dui arrest and will likely face (somewhat dramatic) higher charges.  Nope just simple court supervision was not given a parole officer to report to. And the judge not my lawyer didn’t say I would be getting drug tested.  Doubt you’ll get drug tested, typically DUIs don’t resolve to mandatory testing. Question though; do you have supervised probation, eg— do you see a probation officer on a regular basis? If yes, the probation officer can most likely test you anytime he or she wants. I think the clause that dictates you not to take illicit drugs is more geared towards ratcheting up pressure on you in case you end up getting pulled over for a DUI again.
