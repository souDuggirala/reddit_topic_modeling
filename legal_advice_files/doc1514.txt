 Hello guys. So here is the run down! I met someone online and came to the USA on the 17th of October 2018 using the visitor visa. I had a returning flight that I didn't take in order to spend more time with her. things are going great and everything just keeps getting better, I proposed on the 23rd of December and was married on the 1st of Jan. My visitor visa expired on the 14th. We submitted the I-130 form on the 12th of Jan. Where do we go from here? I'm completely lost with the visa nightmare and jumbled mess of forms to fill out.  Overstaying your visa is a huge red flag. HUGE. You showed that you intended to never leave. You may have a hard time getting permanent residency....

What country are you from / What passport did you enter the USA with? You need an immigration attorney Expect for CBP to be incredibly suspicious about your intentions considering you met someone in person for the first time and got married in about two months Your going to want an immigration attorney. Because what itâ€™s going to look like is that you fraudulently entered the US on a tourist visa with the intention to immigrate.
