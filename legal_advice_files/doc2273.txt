 My fiance and I signed a contract for a wedding venue in December 2017, for our upcoming wedding in May 2019. We booked a ballroom along with the associated rooftop ceremony space. We chose this venue specifically for the rooftop space, which has a beautiful sweeping view of the bay. When driving past the wedding venue over the holiday weekend, I see that they are performing construction on the rooftop deck. A week later I receive an email from the venue stating that they are replacing the rooftop deck with an enclosed room. Seeing as my wedding is coming up in just over 4 months, I have little bargaining power. I cannot back out of the agreement, as I will have no venue and they will have an easier time finding another event for that weekend. Our contract states that all changes to the contract (which outlines the spaces rented) may be modified or amended only in writing and when signed by both parties. They stated that work would be completed in the next few months, but failed to identify a specific completion date. Do I have any options? Or am I stuck paying full price for the ceremony space I didn't approve, which may not be completed in time for my wedding? You can ask them if they'd be amenable to some kind of deal where you break the contract. You have no ability to force the venue not to do the construction. Typically when you're booking an event like this, you want to ensure well ahead of time that A.) No construction is happening B.) If it is, it won't interfere with your events and C.) That you have something added to the contract that minimizes breakage penalty should part of your space change or become unavailable. C is not always an option, but A and B are always open.
