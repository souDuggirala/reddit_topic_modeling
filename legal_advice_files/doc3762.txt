 I work in New York and my boss didn't pay me for all the hours I worked. Do I ask them about it or go directly to the department of labor? I’d talk to your boss first, make sure it wasn’t a mistake. If they won’t make it right go to the department of labor.   Thank you Errors happen. The first step is to ask him about it.
