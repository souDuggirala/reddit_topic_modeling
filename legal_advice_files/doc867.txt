 I'll try to be brief. you My biological dad has never in my entire life paid a dime of child support. My legal guardian passed away and now I'm over 18. Is there anything I can do about it legally?  Nope. Child support goes to your legal guardian not you. The estate may have a claim on the money but if he went 18years not paying it's unlikely the executor is going to collect now. Not really. Are we talking about court-ordered support? Regardless, the support goes to the guardian, not to you. You don't have any right to that money. If the guardian were alive, they could potentially go after it. But, legally speaking, it's the guardian's money and issue, not yours.  I do believe you can, since the parent passed away. Had they not passed, no. But if they passed- and you represent their estate- you can sue for the unpaid support on their behalf. This entirely depends on where you are from, though.
