 So I work for a very well known fast food chain in the UK. My contract is zero hours but I always have work when I need it. My availability, which is the hours I am available to work, was negotiated when I signed my contract for the job. Multiple times however, my employer has given me work that finishes an hour to an hour and half later than what my availability states I can work until. I have discussed this with my employer, and have also asked if I may do more hours during the day, as I currently work until 11pm or Midnight sometimes, and these hours are affecting both my mental and physical health (due to lack of sleep plus work related stress). Since speaking to my employer however, I have noticed consistently that I have been given exclusively later shifts, and that my availability is not being regarded at all. For example I cannot work on Tuesday, but I am occasionally scheduled for a Tuesday. The kicker here is on the company website it states that they will never ask me to work when I am not available, which to me shows a clear breach of company policy. Thank you for your time, Lawyers. Do I have a case? Sorry I was unaware that subreddit existed. r/legaladviceUK
