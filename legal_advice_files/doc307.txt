 I was facing an issue with an electronics product belonging to a famous brand. Let's call it XYZ. I went on the XYZ website and l had a live chat with the customer service. I was disappointed by the curt responses and unwillingness to hear me out. So I gave a low rating and and quit the chat. In a couple of hours, I get an email calling me a "Moron" and asking me to "grow some brains before asking for help". Now this came from a fake email account. However, I'm sure it came from the same customer representative of X. As he had access to my email id and was clearly jilted by the low rating. However, I was shocked by the how he/she used his professional acess for launching a personal attack. I'm seeking legal advice on what's the best way forward to compensate for this breach of privacy. Thanks in advance! Thank you! I have just done that. Send a complaint to the company regarding the actions of the customer service live chat. You have no damages, so that likely your only course of action.
