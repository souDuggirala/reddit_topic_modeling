 I got pulled over in Brother’s car and it had expired reg. I signed ticket and went on about my way. Later I noticed that my Brother’s name was put on ticket and later on the notice to appear. How do I change this?  Yeah I failed to mention he’s on an LDS mission in Brazil. I used his car for a week while my truck was getting its axel repaired.  Since it is his car, isn’t the registration his responsibility?  You appear in court on the court date and tell the judge that it was you and not him.
