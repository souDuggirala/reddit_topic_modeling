 So my bosses son, who also works at the same shop, threatens me with a weapon in hand twice over trivial bullshit. I have 2 witnesses and camera proof. If the conversation doesn't seem to go my way between me and the boss in a little while what are my options? "Hostile work environment" has a specific legal definition that usually is in regards to discrimination, and generally doesn't mean "hostile" in the colloquial sense. I'm not saying don't approach upper management about work issues. I'm saying that when a crime occurs, especially one that involves a weapon, the police are a more appropriate group to handle that than your boss. Kind of. If OP feels like he is/still is in danger that is an issue for the police. However, assuming OP's story is true, the second his bosses son/fellow employee threatened him with a weapon, at work, that created a hostile work environment and that surely is his bosses problem isn't it? [removed] Your boss is not law enforcement. Your recourse when threatened with a weapon is to call the police. Report it to the police
