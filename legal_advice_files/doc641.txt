 Ok so I get my taxes done by a tax preparer. I filed last year and was waiting for my refund. Didn’t get it. So I called the office, they saw that my refund was rejected because someone used my social already. So we filed the right papers and mailed everything in. I got a letter stating I had to wait 180 days so they can investigate. 180 days came and went. They told me no one has taken my account. This was a mistake and it should have someone. They said wait 30 more days and call back. I finally got a hold of my tax prep place and they said they got a hold of someone and they said they moved me up in the list and give them 2/3 weeks if my money isn’t deposited by then call back. So that was dec 20. Then the government shit down. They are now open and still no money and heard nothing. I keep emailing and calling my tax place. Nothing:/ Is there a special Tax ID number or something I’m going to need to file this year?? Last I knew my last year taxes weren’t filed as of beg dec. Since nothing has been taken care of what are the odds someone can use my SSN again before I can get all my tax papers and file? Is my SSN blocked form being used without a password or something? I did call the credit bureaus and there is a block on them. But it was only for 90 days. There have been no accounts open I’ve been watching close. What do I need to file and what do I do next? I would really like my refund. Looks like I’ll get 2018 refund before 2017:/  Thank you so much! This was helpful!! Call the IRS, it's annoying to get someone on the phone but I believe in you. Next you will most likely have to file via certified mail this year. The following years you should receive a letter from the IRS with a numeric code to file online. The mail will come to whatever address is on your W2s. Source: identity was stolen in 2007 and I've been doing this since.
