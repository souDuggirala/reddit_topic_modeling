 Hi, I was wondering if I can claim head of household on my tax return or if I need to file as single. I currently rent a room from my grandparents house. All of our personal finances are separate. I contribute a third of utilities and part of the rent. When applying for covered California I am marked as head of household since all my necessities are paid through my own income.  To file as head of household, you must: 1) Pay for more than half of the household expenses 2) Be considered unmarried for the tax year, and 3) You must have a qualifying child or dependent. It doesnâ€™t sound like you meet those requirements. Based on the facts of your post, no.
