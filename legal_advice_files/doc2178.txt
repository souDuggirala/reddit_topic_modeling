 Hey guys. My first post here so please forgive me if I’m not doing this right. Someone in my family is going through a tough battle with child custody. She is disabled, struggling with money, and is struggling to make ends meet. After going through divorce with her abusive ex- husband and receiving near full custody of her child (he gets to visit every once in a while), she has had this constant problem where the ex-husband is falsely accusing her of doing things she hasn’t done. Also on a side note, the ex-husband has had a long history of abusing multiple women and losing full custody of his children. This is not only a burden on her financially (he usually takes these cases up to court), but it is also becoming a trend where the child is being negatively manipulated to the point where it is becoming very difficult for everybody in my family. The child is usually siding with the ex-husband because of this constant manipulation through his lies. We want to hire a good lawyer but with her financial condition, it is near impossible. Is there any advice you guys can give me as to what we can do? I don’t know much about law, but isn’t it illegal to constantly make false claims against a person and bringing those cases back to court? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks guys! OP, please provide location. Also, if your family member is low-income they may be eligible for free legal aid related to custody and child support depending on the state they reside. Child custody battles costs a lot of money, but also requires lots of research and record-keeping. If your relative has any evidence and people she can speak to who wouldn't mind being witnesses that is something to consider when they do speak to an attorney. If the ex makes threats, try having your relative record it and make copies of it, BUT again this depends on what state they reside in as some states only require one party consent and other states require two party consent. Good luck.
