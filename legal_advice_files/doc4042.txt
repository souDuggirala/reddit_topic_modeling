 I just moved to Texas from Maryland. I live in Houston and my girlfriend lives in Waco and I drive back and forth there every weekend to see her. Just south of Waco on Route 6, I passed by what looked like a few police cars and some regular cars in the right lane all bunched up with their lights on. I slowed down from the approx. 65-70 that i was going to about 55-60 and drove past and saw 3 or 4 police officers who began flashing their flashlights at me. 1 minute later I was pulled over because a Texas law that I wasn’t aware of said that I had to slow down 20 mph below the posted speed limit when passing stopped emergency vehicles on a two lane road. He gave me a citation and since this is my first one I’m not exactly sure how to proceed. Is there anything I can do to avoid this going on my license? Like different pleas in the courtroom, etc. Thank you!
