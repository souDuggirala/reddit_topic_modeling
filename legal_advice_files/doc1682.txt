 Hi all, new to this reddit but I feel completely taken advantage of in this situation and any help would be great. This past summer I worked nearly full time at a grocery store and they were paired with a union. Under the policy, it stated I must get payed extra on Sundays which they didn't. I told them as soon as I noticed and they changed it a few weeks after going back and forth with them. I feel I deserve some sort of compensation for this as I was scheduled 8+ hours every Sunday. On top of that, the boss was very degrading and verbally abusive to me as just a 16 year old. I was recovering from depression at that time and it caused me to relapse. They also made me use a ladder before I was 16 and employed there, which to my knowledge is illegal. Any suggested actions I should take? Thanks for the help. Should I really expect anything out of the union, even if it's just to improve other employees' experiences? You could report them to the union. Union contracts are not laws, they are agreements between groups of workers and their employers. As for the ladder thing, if it is illegal in your area you can report it to the state. As for your boss being mean, not illegal, just poor business practice.
