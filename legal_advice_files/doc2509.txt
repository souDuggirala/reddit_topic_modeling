 I received the email below stating that i needed to resign the changed document and back date it. It was incorrect (which i agree with.) Please see attached the cd that we received from your lender that requires your signature and also attached is a copy of the cd you signed at closing. In section listed as "Projected Payments" the figure was incorrect because it did not disclose your escrow reserves for taxes and insurance that is included in your payment. If you look at the one that you signed you can see where it did not show the escrow reserve amounts. Please sign the corrected copy and date it the date you signed your original cd and drop off at one of our offices so we can forward it back to your lender or you can mail it to us at (name of title company) My question are below; 1. Should I agree to sign this new document. If so should i back date it. 2. Are there any other legal implications that i will possibly exposed to as a result of me signing and sending this. 3. The pages that I signed the projected payments did not include P I also the closing cost where very different. Is anyone other than myself exposed due to this? Mainly would my title insurance cover this mistake and pay the P I on my mortgage? Thanks for any help you can give. Also I am strongly considering contacting a local real estate attorney if yall think that would be wise.
