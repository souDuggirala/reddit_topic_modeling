We just separated a couple days ago and not sure where to start or if I should get a layer or what.  Our child has my last name and live at my house that I own. I don't want to take the child away from the mother but I do not want her to try and take her away from me, I dont think she will but I want to be safe and dont want to lose my daughter. I just want to get my ducks in a row and not get fucked. I believe she has 100% custodial rights since we had our daughter out of wed lock but I'm not sure on that.

Thank you for reading. Did you put your name on the Birth Certificate? If so I think you have some legal jurisdiction over your child. Also depends on where you live.
