 I received a job offer for a software engineering position at another company. It’s a great company with better growth prospects, culture, and a really nice pay raise compared to my current job. I’d love to take the job, but there is some gray area with my current job because my noncompete does not clearly state what a conflicting product or service would be. The company I received the offer from defines a competing product/service as any “any company involved with the independent financing and/or marketing of video games and derivatives thereof created by third party video game developers.” My current company does not involve the financing of video games. However, we do have clients which are mobile video game companies that we do help with online marketing. But we help all sorts of companies, not just those within the video game space. I’d like to leave my current company without burning any bridges, but I don’t think that’s possible. Thus, I’ve been leaning towards declining the job offer. It’s important to note that the prospective company had their legal team examine my current company and they don’t think there would be any issues, but I know I’m the one that’s liable if issues do arise. Additionally, both noncompetes are under the jurisdiction of the state of New York, in case that info is necessary. I’d love to hear what you guys would do if you were in my position.  I concur; consult with an attorney whose duty is to you and not a third party that seeks to benefit from your employ. I'd be inclined to trust the legal advice of the new company, but in an abundance of caution I would consult with an attorney (who does employment law or contracts) to see if their analysis of your non-compete lines up with what the company's lawyers think. This shouldn't cost more than a few hundred bucks, and may cost less.
