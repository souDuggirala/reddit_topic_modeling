 What happened was that I came across a few accounts that were hosting cp. In disgust, I reported all of them to Instagram. My one question is, am I in trouble? Ok thanks. I reported it to Instagram and am now waiting for a response. You could have, but reporting it to instagram is probably the fastest way to get it removed. Plus they can then escalate it to the proper authorities. No. I reported them to Instagram, considering how they should delete it. Should I have reported to authorities instead? No, you're fine. You did the right thing by reporting the accounts.
