 I received a speeding ticket last week. The police officer who pulled me over told me to plead not guilty on the citation and he'll get my points reduced. I've never gotten a ticket before so I don't know the way the system operates, but I would assume any reduction of points would be decided by a DA or judge. Do police officers have the power to have the points reduced, like he stated?  I did exactly that in PA. It's up to the judge, but if you're courteous they'll tend to drop it down. State that you're there not fight but ask for lenienacy. They don’t have that power. But that’s generally how it will work, if u go to the court house they will let u please to a lesser charge, like no points
