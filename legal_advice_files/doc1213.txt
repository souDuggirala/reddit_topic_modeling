 Before I left, she took my laptop (with my school stuff), debit card, phone, and attempted to force me to quit my job, then my stepfather proceeded to tell me to l needed to leave the house. I packed all my clothes and the cash I had, took pillows and my school bag, and went to work. They later found my car, (I paid for it but it's in their name), dragged me out of it, dumped out all my belongings, and took it back Since then, they have repeatedly gone to/called my work, forcing my manager into a position to fire me due to them causing scenes in front of costumers. I was there only one of those times, went with what my stepfather said, but he continued to yell in front of my customers. Most importantly, they drained my bank account (although the card was locked?), and all my savings, a total of about $4500. Now she's refusing to send my school proof of residence, having mentioned to the school after I left that we had moved. What legal measures can I take to possibly get back, or at least prevent future instances, my money/belongings, and prevent myself from being withdrawn from my school? tl;dr my parents forced me to leave home without my important belongings and are now trying to force me to come home, how can I get my things back? I have, and showed the blue/black bruises from being dragged from my car. They said since I don't have documentation of abuse (I do on the aforementioned laptop) there isnt anything they can do but offer shelter information.  Call CPS and let them know what is going on. They’re obligated to provide for you until you’re an adult.
