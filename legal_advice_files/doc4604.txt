 So I'm currently 17 And no longer work at tjmaxx but last winter when I worked there they would keep me all the way up to 11:45pm and regularly schedule me till 11pm on regular school days. I know that jobs can only keep minors till 10pm and my new job honours this. During this time it effected my sleep heavily. I began sleeping alot during school times and my grades began to slip. Is there any way I can sue? Would I get anything out of sueing? I mean my new job never schedules me for anything longer then 8 hours and nothing past 10pm  Huh you're right, weird that 1 website is claiming restrictions on workers 16/17 but the DOL site says otherwise. I wonder if that's where OP got the idea too.   I would trust the DoL website more  . Fourteen and fifteen year olds may not engage in labor between the hours of 8:00pm and 6:00am. 16 and 17 year olds may work as late as 10:00pm but still may not labor before 6:00am. So if OP was 16 or 17 when working there he's correct, he can't work passed 10pm or before 6am. Still not much he can do about it now.  That's actually only for [children]() between the ages of 14 and 15.
