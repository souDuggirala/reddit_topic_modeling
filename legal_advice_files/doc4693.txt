 Hello, I am from Florida. So I have a misdemeanor criminal charge that I was arrested for 6 days ago. I was kept in a holding cell overnight and in the morning the judge asked if I had the money to get a private attorney and I said no and he said I would then get a public defender. I didn’t know what I was doing because I have never been arrested before. However, after leaving and coming home and now doing research on my case and speaking to a private attorney, I definitely want to pursue a private attorney for the highest chances of getting my charges removed. My question is: because I said no to the private attorney at my first appearance with the judge, am I stuck with a public defender? I haven’t even received a court date yet and do not know how appointing a public defender works, so I want to do anything possible to make sure I’m in control of my legal counsel from this point forward.  Oh ok. Thanks a lot.  No, you can hire an attorney at any time.
