 So for a class, our teacher required that we submit a physical photo of ourselves as a child to get full credit. This assignment is also worth a lot more than others. Unlike yearbooks, we -the class- are unsure of where they are going as she says she will keep those photos. She has apparently been doing this for several years, and I want to know if this is legal. Can she require students to submit a physical photo on a higher-valued assignment? Thanks. I'll talk with some classmates. If more than one of the individuals in your class feels this way you might consider going in a group of three to represent the class as a whole to the dean of her Department to share your concerns. She is asking for pictures that she has stated she will not return and has refused to give a reason for refusing to return the pictures. She has no legal right to use these pictures in any manner, as she cannot expect to have the copyright to any of them simply by requiring you to give her a copy of a photo taken of you in childhood. This is quite odd.  Yes it's legal. There's no law that says "teachers cannot require a photo of a student"  But I assumed it was for remembrance, maybe. Yes Has she refused to tell you why she plans to keep the photos? It's for a Spanish class, and the assignment is to write about your childhood. We have been working on forming sentences in different sentence tenses, but it only amounts to about 50% of the assignment. How is this assignment connected to the curriculum? It's possible that what she is doing could be considered a problem by the administration of the college. Sure, why not?
