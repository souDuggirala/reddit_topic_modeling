 I had my car cleaned, with two deep scent sprays for the air filter and dumped a can of aerosol until it was empty when I cleaned my car and was pulled over for no reason. I didn’t have anything in my car and he pulled me out the car and made me sit in his car while he searched my car without my permission. He didn’t find anything and just left me to clean the mess he made in my car. Is there any way I can sue him or the police department? This is obviously a wild guess - I am not a mind reader and can not explain the officer’s actions - but normal people don’t put that much effort into making their car smell like air freshener. Frankly I’d be suspicious too. Even though the car may have been cleaned and didn't smell like weed, you probably stunk of it. You can file a complaint with the officer's supervisor. If you believe your civil rights have been violated then you can contact an attorney who specializes in civil rights actions. You may be entitled to damages to fix your car. I suspect the officer searched your car because he had sufficient cause to suspect you were breaking the law. I feel there are details missing. Why did he approach your car to begin with? Were you pulled over?  You dont have any damages. You can file a complaint. You can talk to an attorney but you really dont have strong grounds to sue. Because I doubt that you are giving 100% accurate info. There is no reason for an officer to jeopardize his entire job and livelihood for a stranger.
