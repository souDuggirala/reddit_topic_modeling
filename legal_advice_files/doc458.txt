 My wife works for a college. When her work day was finished, she left her office and went to the gym to watch a basketball game. When the game was done, she slipped in the parking lot on ice and broke her forearm. Is she entitled to a workman's claim based on being injured on college property not having left campus for the day? Yes, it was several hours after her workday was complete, but she had not left the property yet.  Of course, it depends what state you are in. In CA, you could certainly argue that his should be covered under WC, I've seen way more ridiculous facts that led to a finding of what is known as "industrial causation". However, even if this may not be covered under workers' compensation, you could also have a personal injury claim. Unfortunately, it would be hard to prove the college was negligent in either failing to warn or failing to remove the ice from the parking lot, but you may still have a case depending on several factors. Many attorneys do free consultations for this sort of thing, I'd suggest giving one of them a call. Hope this helps and good luck! Source: am CA WC/PI attorney. No, she wasn't working so the workman's comp likely wouldn't apply.
