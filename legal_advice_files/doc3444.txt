 A friend of mine was made notified today they were being made redundant, with tomorrow being their last day. I was just wondering whether this it is completely legal to give only a days notice. She worked their for roughly 12 years but signed a new contract 3 years ago. Instincts say it isnâ€™t legal to give this short notice but wanted confirmation/advice on how to go about this. Thanks in advance You should ask /r/legaladviceuk /r/legaladviceuk might be a better place to post for more accurate information. [removed] /r/legaladviceUK Location is Manchester, England  England  England, pls could you outline on what grounds this is legal etc just so I can have a better depth of understanding [removed] If she's actually under a binding employment contract, then that contract should spell out whether or not 1 day of notice is proper or not. Labor law varies wildly from place to place, so a location is important. Location not given. You did not include your location, and what you mean by "contract" is not clear. It's likely legal, and likewise your friend is allowed to quit with little to no notice as well.
