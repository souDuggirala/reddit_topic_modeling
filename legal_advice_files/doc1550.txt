 Now this is going to sound ridiculous but I have a legit question. My ex girlfriend had my portable charger for phones and electronic devices. Once we broke up, I requested she mail it to me multiple times. After about 4 months I have just received the package and it’s smashed to bits. Is there anything I can do? It was 80$. I know this isn’t a more serious post but can I call the police? Or do anything about this  I would contact the city in Pennsylvania where it was sent from The police won't get involved in a civil dispute over a charger. If she won't pay you, you can: -go to PA -file paperwork to sue in small claims. Pay the filing fee which in some jurisdictions is well over $100 - properly serve defendant with notice that she is being sued -wait for your court date -explain to judge what happened. She'll just say it was damaged in shipping or already broke. Maybe you get lucky and the judge sides with you. - she still won't pay, then you have to file more paperwork and wait and potentially garnish her wages. Or you can just buy a new charger.  She lives in Pennsylvania and I live in New York. She sent the package from Pennsylvania and I have it right now. I understand this could be tricky  Do you have screenshots or anything? Do you live in the same area that the package was sent from? Because then you could be dealing with separate jurisdictions for the damage and where it was found damaged. Yes, she verbally bragged about it in a chat room with 2 of my friends and her cousin. And no worries,I understand your speculation  Yes, she mentioned it on the phone to 2 of my close friends and her cousin at the same time. Her address and name are on the package as well. It is evident it was her actions resulting in the destruction, she admitted it to 3 people verbally. Can you prove it was her and wasn’t damaged in shipping?
