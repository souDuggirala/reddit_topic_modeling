 My lawyer said I didn’t have to go, unless I want to pay the ticket immediately, which I did. I did not tell my attorney I was in the area. He texted me and told me what happened, and how much I had to pay. Is there anything illegal about me being nearby? I live near by and have other business in the same compound. He didn’t have to give a reason why I didn’t appear, like I was unavailable. I have tried to contact him about this, but I doubt he will get back to me at all, or at least not this year. I think one of the witnesses or their attorney may have seen me in the lot, and now I can’t stop thinking about this. I am in Michigan
