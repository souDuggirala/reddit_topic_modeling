 New york state I'm not entirely sure this would be the correct place to post this but I will anyway. I am a type 1 diabetic and for the past 2 years have been struggling with chronic high blood sugars and absolute loss of control of my diabetes. I recently requested FMLA leave for a couple weeks in order to get everything back in order but I found out online that NY state has paid FMLA which I was pretty sure during this whole process it would be unpaid or a mixture of unpaid and my vacation time. The laws are quite confusing online and don't state anything specifically about leaving for your own personal medical condition, just having a baby, helping a family member with a medical condition, or helping family of an active service member. My question really is, would I qualify for paid FMLA? I do pay monthly on my pay stub for FMLA paid leave and it's clear as day on there but I'm just not too sure how these laws work, this is also my first time ever having to take leave like this. The Paid Family Leave act that just went into effect in NY does not cover this situation, unfortunately 't state anything specifically about leaving for your own personal medical condition, just having a baby, helping a family member with a medical condition, or helping family of an active service member. Like you say, it does not cover personal medical issues, so if someone were on leave to take care of you, they could apply, but you don't qualify by yourself. It's a maternity/paternity leave law at heart
