 My bipolar gf got drunk last night and I left to go get smokes. I got back 45 mins later and she accused me of cheating on her. We got into an argument and she said she would call the police and say I abused her. I left again and came back two hours later only to find out she did call the police and told them i did abuse her. They left a 1 week restraining order at my door for us to stay away from each other. I didn't speak to any police and I don't know if this restraining order is the only thing to come of this. What could I expect to happen. I'm in California btw You're going to have to find a place to go for at least week according to that order.  Eyyyyy We rent a room together and I have no where to go Why in your narrative do you still refer to her as your girlfriend and not your ex-girlfriend? That should be your first step.
