 Greetings, My wife and I live at a boarding High School that SHE works at. I have been asked if I would be willing to stand duty(babysit students) one week a night for 4 hours. My wife and I figured what the heck, but when I received an email from HR with the agreement, it had it listed as a stipend payment for $300 until March 5th, paid out after that date, which is WAY under minimum wage. I am not looking to start or explore legal routes with them, but I feel like a stipend isn't the correct way of payment here. Any help?
