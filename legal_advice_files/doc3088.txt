  A neighbor not too far from the family friend's house has 2 German Shepherds. They were able to unlock the gate to the fence and get out. This is something that the owner of the dogs was well aware of. These dogs have been seen chasing after deer in the area. The German Shepards got out of the fenced in yard, and went over to the family friend's house. She, her husband, and her two dogs around 20lbs each were in the yard. The German Shepards attacked both of the dogs. One got away with only minor injuries and is recovering. The other one was severely injured, he went into emergency surgery and didn't make it. Now there is another neighbor who has a security system that points in the general area the incident happened. He is going to go through the footage and see if the incident was caught on camera. The German Shepherd owner said he will cover all medical costs, which if iirc is at least 2.3k but I think it was 23k. The cops were called and I don't know if I police report was filed. The area also does not have any leash laws. My questions are: What legal recourse does she have. What is likely to happen to the German Shepards. What should be done should the owner of the German Shepards refused to pay up. I have no idea what they used to communicate when he said that. Was anything done here considered criminal, while I don't think there was IANAL. The victim can sue for the value of the dog, and medical treatments. A report needs to be filed with police/animal control, there is a more than 0% the shepherds will be put down.
