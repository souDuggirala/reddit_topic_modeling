 I got a new job opportunity and left my salaried position at my old company. Gave the two weeks, etc. Previously I had taken a week paid vacation time. When I told them I was leaving for a new job, they told me that they wouldn’t pay me for the last week because I had only been salaried for about six months and I wasn’t entitled to my paid vacation until ten months - in other words, because they had paid me for the week I went on vacation, they wouldn’t be paying me for my last week working there. I never signed a salary agreement by the way, one day my payroll just switched from hourly to salaried. After I left I ended up being paid for my last week anyway. I’ve been gone for a month now and my boss just told me it was a mistake and they need the money back in the form of a written check. Are they allowed to ask me that/ do I need to pay? If I don’t pay can they legally pursue me. Any advice would be appreciated, I just want to know before responding. Thank you!  Technically it could fall under corporate theft, so yes pay it back.. not to mention that's its douchey to keep it and steal from your previous employer..
