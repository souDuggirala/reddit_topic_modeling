 Hi legaladvice. I worked for Employer A since January of last year. In February I signed up on their health insurance. In late December, my Employer decided to sell their business to Employer B. The transaction happened swiftly with less than a week’s notice. I was not privy to the contract and terms but I was told that we would have existing coverage under Employer A until the beginning of February when we would be enrolled under Employer B’s insurance. I just tried to fill a prescription and was told I have no coverage, and today I just received a letter from my insurance stating my coverage ended in November. I had surgery in a November and had to go for a check up in December. Many of my colleagues (less than 50, but over 40) went to get exams and fill prescriptions and now we just found out we had no coverage. I did not notice earlier on my pay stub as I am commissioned so my check can fluctuate week to week. Do we have any rights as workers? Do you pay for medical insurance to date or one month in advance? Was it the same as previous amounts? Yes, although I’m not sure it was the full amount. Premiums were deducted from two ouchecks in december.  Were premiums deducted from your paychecks for the time period in question?
