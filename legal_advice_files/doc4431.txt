 Due to an incident at work, I received legal advice to not reach out or speak to anyone at work. I forget exactly why, but it was like tampering with a witness and the defense could get that testimony removed? Can someone explain that to me again? So the question I have is after the trial, what do I say to people that I had stopped talking to because of the legal advice?  If you're not under a court order or attorney's advice to not tell them, then you can tell them anything you want.
