 Tennessee I am considering ending my marriage of 7 years, and am putting together my "exit plan". For the last several years, I have been a stay at home parent to our two year old. I left school to care for our child and support him in his career. So, with an incomplete education, and a years long gap in my work history, I am essentially starting from zero, if I leave. Because of his behavior, I am confident that I would be awarded primary custody of my son. But, would I be eligible to ask for alimony, as well? It has long been established between the two of us that he would financially support us, while I put everything on hold to care for the baby. Then complete my degrees, when he was more independent (I plan on returning to school this Fall, either way). Is that grounds enough to request support? Edit: spelling and grammar and clarification There is very likely an alimony and child support calculator website that will help you. It lets you enter estimated incomes and come up with scenarios. However, realize that you are likely going to have to get a full time job - alimony is intended to assist and balance finances between two parties, not subsidize one person not working.  Likely yes, you would have grounds to ask for support in your situation. How much and for how long will depend on the divorce proceedings themselves. Since I am in the information gathering stage of the process, I was hoping there might be some here, who could give me an idea of whether or not I had grounds to even ask, before deciding on my best course of action.  I should clarify that by custody, I mean primary custody. I will edit my post to reflect that.  These are all questions you should pose to a divorce attorney.  Yes, probably. You'll want to consult a divorce attorney to handle the details and determine how much support you could be awarded.
