 I have reviewed the entire chat history between my daughter and this guy. It goes on and on and on. She has been participating in video chats with him and sending pictures at his request. They were talking about meeting up in the future so they could have sex. There is some Master/slave type conversation as well. Does the fact that there was video and pictures being sent as well as the BDSM-type play change anything? A deputy from my local sheriff's office called me yesterday. He said there's nothing to be done unless she specifically told him she was a minor/under 16. I can show him pages and pages of chat history where she makes it very clear that she's a kid, and if he met her he would see that she's definitely not mature enough to pass for over 16 (or over 18), and since I now know they've been video-chatting, he knows she's not over 16 either. He, like the commenters on my previous post, was more interested in providing parenting advice than addressing my very specific questions. The burden of proof is on the victim, he advised me, and while that may be true in his mind that does not sit well with me - so I have contacted my county prosecutor directly. I have been in contact with Discord. I have also submitted online reports to the police department in the area where he lives, the FBI, the NCMEC, and the cyber crime tipline for his area. So far, only Discord has responded and they have been helpful so far. Parenting wise, since I know you're going to ask, she is allowed to have her flip phone during the day for emergency purposes. There is no more online access at home. She is grounded, but she is grounded for lying to us about accessing websites she was specifically told not to do, not for sex chat. I haven't exploded at her, and neither has her dad. I am going to discuss the legal ramifications of what she's done with her this afternoon - she needs to know that this was illegal, it's not her fault - she got caught up in it and didn't know; but she also needs to know that she can get in big trouble for this kind of stuff both legally and physically. This guy isn't her boyfriend, he doesn't have her best interests at heart, and she's one step away from being sold into prostitution. We have an acquaintance who I was just informed was charged with a felony for sending nudes to a guy she met online. She's only a little older than my daughter. The deputy told me to call a child sexual assault advocacy center, so I think I'm going to do that.  Thank you for posting an update!
