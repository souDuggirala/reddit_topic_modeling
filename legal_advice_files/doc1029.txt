 Okay, so I've been permabanned from 4chan after a thread a few nights ago with this girl who was fully dressed in OP's original post. A few minutes later, he posted another picture of her with less clothes on. Someone said something about her being 18 years old, while others argued that mods were gonna take down the thread. The thread survived some time, enough for the OP to continue posting pictures of her with less and less clothes on. Someone then said something about reverse image searching the picture, and I did. I thought that since I could find this so easily posted on multiple clearnet websites and that the thread hadn't been removed by mods, she had to be 18. After posting what I found on the thread, I was informed that she was 16 and now I'm permabanned. I can appeal my ban tomorrow and I don't know what to do. It was a complete accident and I've never done anything like this before. You have no legal issue for being banned. You very well may have one for posting child pornography.  Are you seriously worried about a permaban on a site that doles out free accounts when you've just admitted to viewing, distributing, and searching for child porn? Align your priorities. If the police speak to you demand an attorney and make no comment. Stop going anywhere that child porn might be found.  This is not a legal issue. 4chan can ban you for any reason. Someday you will look back on this and realize they did you a favor.
