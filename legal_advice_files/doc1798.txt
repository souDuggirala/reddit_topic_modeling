 If the only evidence of him brandishing the knife was you saying that he did, an arrest would be unlikely. I’m not sure what you mean by tech problems. Contact the chief of police’s office and request that he have his department address the situation and take a report and also go to the municipal court and get a restraining order.  Maybe. It's best to call the cops as close to the criminal incident as possible, generally.
