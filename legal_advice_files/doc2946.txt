 An altercation happened with a couple family members with screaming and some physical interactions. I got involved in the altercation, and the police were called which calmed down the situation right up until they left. My father has a history of abusive behavior and began screaming, calling me names, and threatening me and my life. I got scared and as soon as he left for work in the morning (in the morning he woke up and immediately began screaming at another family member until he left the house), I left with all of my belongings and the car which belongs to him. I’m worried that he is going to report the car as stolen. I’m too far from home to bring it back right away. Here are some options I have thought of: - driving the car back down in a few days and taking the bus back up - leaving the car somewhere and telling him where it is I’m just looking for advice on if he reports the car stolen - what can I do? I don’t want or need the car after I get to my destination. Do I have to bring the car back or is telling him where it is before he reports it stolen enough? How old are you? If you were a stranger who stole a car would it be enough to ditch it and tell the owner it's location? Either way you still stole it. But since that's already done your best option, imo, is to tell him you took it and to bring it back as soon as possible.
