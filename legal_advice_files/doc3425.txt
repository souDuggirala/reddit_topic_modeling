You were a victim of fraud, you can file a police report. Your money is gone.  It's a common scam. The money is gone. You owe the money back to the bank when the deposit is eventually reversed due to being fraudulent. If you can positively identify and locate this individual, you may have some recourse. Identifying and locating this individual is likely going to be extremely difficult, next to impossible. File a police report, and perhaps report the profile to Facebook. That's about all you can do.
