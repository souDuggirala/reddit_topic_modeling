 Hi! I use a budgeting app that recently added a checking account option. I opted in since it cost nothing I wanted to check it out; turns out I don't really have any use for it it doesn't offer any compelling reason to switch. I contacted the company asking to close the checking account. They told me that it is impossible, and that they currently have no way to close their own checking accounts. I don't owe them any money or anything. It's been over 70 days since I my first request to close the account. Is there any legal way to compel them to close it? Is it legal to force someone to keep a checking account open? Thanks, y'all! Interesting, I hadn't thought of it from that framing, thank you! I've seen a couple of lawblogs mention that California has a law requiring that they close an account in a certain number of days, but I can't find any specific reference to which law does that, exactly.  The question really is whether there's any law requiring them to close your account for you. There really isn't. There could be some kind of obligation they created for themselves in the account holder terms and you might check those.
