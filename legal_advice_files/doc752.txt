 My divorce was official December 26th (Merry X-Mas to me!). My ex moved to California and gained residency there. He was able to file for divorce very simply (we were married for under 3 years)... Mailed me papers to sign, and I mailed them back. We both signed stating that we owe each other nothing. It was all very quick and simple. I have my copies of all the paper work. The paper work states that I will be changing my last name back to my maiden name. Do I have a timeline for how quickly I need to change my name back? Also, if I were to remarry and take someone else's last name would I be able to do that instead of changing my name back to my maiden name? Thanks for reading.  Should do it immediately. If it says “shall” that’s legaleaze for “you will do it now”. If you are electing to do t. I believe there’s a reasonable amount of time. Like 3 months. I can’t remember. My ex was a swamp rat and I didn’t want that cheating snake having my name so I demanded it immediately and they did it for her the day we finalized in court. Most states will do it for free at the time of filing for free. See if you can get an official copy and take it to your local courthouse ASAP and see if you can avoid the fee.
