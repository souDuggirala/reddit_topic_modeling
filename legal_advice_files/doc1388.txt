 They're very clearly run down... grinding, shaking, locking up, etc. It's frankly unnerving to use them. I looked around today and found the inspection papers on the inner walls of the elevators and saw they were supposed to be inspected in 2017. Who do I contact to report this? City government, building inspector  Thank you! I'd start with local government. They'll have a licensing and inspections department that handles this sort of stuff. They should be able to tell you where to send a complaint for unsafe elevators and expired elevator inspections. I work for an elevator company, search your states elevator inspection department and contact them. They regularly come out every so often to make sure paperwork is recent and if not they shut down the elevator until it is inspected but it can take a while before they come out on their own sometimes  Osha is only for employees and only if you have complaints about your employer. They will tell you to f off. Go to your cities building inspection department. What state? Osha
