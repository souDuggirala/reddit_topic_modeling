 TL:DR Need to cancel court date - who is responsible to do it? Location: California I was served a garnishment of wages and filed an exemption claim. I followed up with our Sheriff's Office at the 10 day response date and the creditor had filed a dispute \BUT\ it was received after the 10 day window was up. The Sheriff's Office issued a release of the garnishment (and I have a copy of it). The lawyer's office (that served the garnishment) went ahead and set up a court date for the hearing for the exemption anyway. My question: Who is responsible for canceling this court date? Do I have to respond in some way? If so, what form do I need to use? Also, what is the best way to start a negotiation to settle this debt? I don't have cash outright to throw at them but I'd figure out something to make this go away ($9K original debt from 2008-ish). Thanks for any help!  You can look up the Court Clerk or Calendar Clerk by Department number - it should be on your court paperwork. [removed] It is usually on the website, or on the papers you were served. Thanks for the response! Is there an easy way to find the phone number for the Court Clerk? I seriously spent an hour searching the court website trying to find a phone number or instructions on what to do.... You can try contacting the clerk for the department, explain the situation, and asking if the hearing is still set.
