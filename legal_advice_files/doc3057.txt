 I had a title loan on my vehicle that was behind in payments. they repossed my car in the middle of the night on December 14th. I came up with money to pay the loan off in full on December 24th. I went to pick my can up December 26th . When I crunk the car up coolant started pouring out of it, upon inspection there was a large hole in the bottom of the radiator. The car was driving perfectly fine before it was towed. I have called title max about this, they keep telling me the company that towed it is investigating it and they will get back with me. this has been going on for 3 days now. what should I do? arent they liable for the damage that was caused? who should I speak to? I really need my car back and running. any advice would be appreciated.
