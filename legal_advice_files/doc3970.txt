 They built an addition (sunroom) to the house about 1 or 2 years ago, before we moved in. The sunlight was filled in, but still has holes where it'll leak water (and parts of the roof apparently?). This is the only room with carpet in it, and it smells awful because of the water. We've contacted the management about this through email, but they still haven't done a thing. I've tried calling, but keep getting redirected. Is there anything legally that can be done? It's terrible.  Document the issue with photos if you haven't already. I'd send a demand letter (google that phrase for templates) that succinctly states you expect them to permanently resolve the leak issue by xx/xx/xxxx (perhaps give them four weeks) or that you'll expect a rent credit as the room isn't habitable due to the leak and carpet damage.
