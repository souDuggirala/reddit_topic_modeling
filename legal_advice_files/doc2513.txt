 In the past 2 weeks i have made 0 hours and $0 at my "Job". My manager didn't even contact me, nor send me a schedule. She sent me a schedule in the past where I wasn't working because of the holidays so I know she chose not to send it to me. I had to ask my coworkers and then eventually ask her, herself. Not only that but the weeks before this i have only been making a maximum of 4 hours a week. My manager is constantly being neglectful when it comes to me personally and I have even heard from my coworkers that she talks about me behind my back. She has called me and another coworker "Dumb and Dumber," which hurts my feelings especially. I have payments to make and groceries to buy since I'm a student but recently I have been running out of food and barely been able to make my payments thanks to reaching out to my parents but that defeats the purpose of having my own job. When I asked my boss what was going on she just told me that since I am a part time employee that doesn't guarantee me hours. I can understand that maybe for 1 week but 2 weeks means I'm basically unemployed. Not only that but she has made it clear that she will not be scheduling me for the following weeks after this. I'm not sure where I stand within my legal rights but this whole thing leaves me feeling like a victim. Is there and grounds or precedent for the scenario I'm currently experiencing.  File for unemployment and start looking for a new job. What you do is find a new job and file for unemployment.  Hurt feelings aren't illegal. You should get another job.  Fixed Not legal advice: But look into uber/Lyft, rover/wag, bitesquad, instacart ect. They helped a lot when I was a student. (My friend still does instacart and makes roughly 300-500 dollars a month pretax doing 3-5 hours of work each friday.) Or look into a new part time job, at least for the meantime.
