 Hi all, First time post here, so please excuse my noobie mistakes. I am a sole trader company (just me, registered as a Pty ltd) that performs earthmoving repairs. I replaced a hydraulic pump on a grader for a customer. The customer was going to put it through insurance (that's what it's for after all) and so I completed my repairs in line with insurers expectations (extra wordy reporting and pics etc). The claim was apparently rejected (I was not contacted over this) and now the customer is not paying me, stating that I have been sabotaging his equipment and he's already paid me too much for previous repairs. I have a clause down the bottom of my (signed) service report saying that all goods supplied belong to my Pty ltd until paid for in full. My question is, am I allowed to repossess the entire machine until the debt is paid? The pump is integral to the machine (steering, brakes etc) and I have nothing I can do after to resell the pump for anywhere near what I paid for it. Total debt owed is $7500, $4500 of that is the part and the rest in oils and labour. I have sent a debt collection agency after him, but they just sent some vague letters and threw their hands up in the air when he came back with these ridiculous accusations of sabotage. I have since found out he gave me an inactive ABN and has moved business address since, so I'm also a bit stuck on how to apply to VCAT without this data. I live and work in Melbourne, Australia. Thankyou, Legal Advice, for any help you could provide.
