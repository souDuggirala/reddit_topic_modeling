 I was arrested summer of this year in one parish while on felony possession charges in another and bonded out. My probation officer decided not to take me to jail, so I finished paying off my felony probation paying my replacement PO the last time as the former had moved to anothet job. The same day I was arrested by misdemeanor PO for not finishing payments. I was given 30 days - time served from initial arrest. part way through the sentence my felony probation officer said I had to do 30 more days because of my arrest from that summer (October now). I was released on the original date of 22 days and 19 days later I was called and told to return for jail,I wasn't supposed to be let out early. So I turned my self in, got my father and lawyer to get me signed up for a rehab program. The judge allowed me to go to rehab, but I was to be returned back to jail in completion. They're trying to revoke my probation.I still haven't been to court in the parish with my recent charge. It's the same day as my release from the than facility. My lawyer for this charge is paid for, but in the parish I'm on detainer for is a public defender who doesn't seem to be interested in doing anything other than the bare minimum on his part. I was recommended here for the next level of treatment, but since I have to go back to jail they don't want me to make progress over there for nothing, so they decided not to accept me just having me complete the 28 days. So I will miss my court date and in January where I'll be detained they'll more than likely push my revocation back until after I resolve my new charge. Which could have me in there for a while I'm trying to find out if there's anything j can do before I leave here to have my hold lifted, or, so I can OR in return, so I can wait for court on the outside or any other helpful routes I can take. Edit : I'm in Louisiana
