 She has retained a DWI attorney who from a Google search has done pretty well in the courtroom. She failed her field sobriety test. She was breathalyzed and blew a .13% BAC. She's very nervous and is hoping to hear that it will be reduced. Does anyone have any good outcomes stories? Her attorney was very surprised with how quickly she was due in court. Her attorney was very surprised with how quickly she was due in court. Not sure how NY works, but coming from someone in CA I can safely say that is the fastest turnaround for a court date I have seen. Additionally, (coming from CA) your friend is likely facing a 1st offense DWI. If she blew a .08, she would have a better chance to receive a reduced wet reckless charge but .13 is a tad high. Perhaps her group/AA classes might get reduced, but not sure what NY state law entails. Best of luck Her attorney gave her the best and worst case scenarios. That's it. She should ask her lawyer.
