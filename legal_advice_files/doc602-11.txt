I'm going to keep this brief as I don't have much time and this was a random thought. Onision (YouTuber), when in a relationship with the underage Shiloh, "transported" her across state lines with the expressed intention of sexual relations. Since this began in and occurred partly in a state in which Shiloh would be underage, this actually classifies Onision for a felony (based on intent)

I want to post this here as well to get a  consensus from a source much better than myself when pertaining to law. Let me know what you think. Then make a post asking how you can support the alleged victim. And keep in mind that you're not batman. Forward to authorities and let them handle it.  Because the sidebar says so? The victim is not in the position to do this for herself, and this is the most populated sub. Therefore, I think this is the right choice (even though not technically). I appreciate the explanation, though Because this sub is for questions about your legal problems. It's not discussion of other people.

For instance, the YouTube could ask if he messed up on here, but you asking if he did is technically off topic.  That doesn't really explain why, but I have. It isnt a question of formatting. Its a question of content. This content doesn't have a place on r/legaladvice and fits much better in r/legaladviceofftopic Ok. Why is that? Sorry, can you elaborate? Could I have reformatted my post? /r/legaladviceofftopic is better for this Legaladviceofftopic.
