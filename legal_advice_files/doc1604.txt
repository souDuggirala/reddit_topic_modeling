 My boyfriend is looking to vacate a place which he and 5 others signed a lease for over 15 years ago in southern Ca. He is the only person still in tenancy and has since become the “property manager.” He rents out a front house and two additional rooms to three other people. He would now like to move out. He says that in the last 15 years he has not signed another lease agreement, only receipts of acknowledgment for raises in rent. The original tennants who were on the lease never removed themselves from the lease. As it stands, if any tennant does not pay rent or bills, he is responsible for covering the loss to the homeowner and is also responsible for filling any empty apartments. The homeowner is looking to sell the property and he wants to leave before the house goes on the market. Is he protected in any way? How can he get his deposit back? What needs to happen so he can make a clean break?
