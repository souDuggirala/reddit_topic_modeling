 A couple of nights ago my younger sister, 20, was arrested for a DUI. She used my ID to purchase the alcohol and at the time of arrest the police found my ID and added false identification when she was booked. Can I be held liable? Or are there any consequences for me since she had my ID? this happened in CA.  I did not, and thatâ€™s a whole other detail. Thank you  No. Unless you gave it to her (it sounds like you did not) I figured. Thank you. Yes she is in the process of obtaining a lawyer, but i was curious where, if at all, I stand in this situation, Probably not but it's possible. A lot of this will depend on what your sister tells police surrounding her obtaining and using your ID. You sister needs a lawyer.
