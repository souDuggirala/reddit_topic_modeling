 I’m located in Georgia and a friend of my family has recently gotten pregnant. The girl is 14 years old and found out last night. The father of her child is a 22 year old man. The mother of the girl isn’t going to attempt to file charges on the twenty two year old, and the girl doesn’t want to either, so what can the rest of the family do to ensure that he doesn’t just get away with this?  Yes. A criminal case involves the state prosecuting the defendant. The state doesn’t need the permission or support of the victim to prosecute an alleged offender. You absolutely should notify the police about this. They’ll handle it from there. Don’t let this guy get away with rape.  Exactly. In Georgia, the age of consent is sixteen. Also in Georgia, the uncorroborated testimony of the child is insufficient to support a charge of statutory rape. A pregnancy is definitely corroborating evidence. Yes - Georgia has manadatory reporting laws - so any medical professional has to report it or they can be penalized themselves. Yes. The testimony of the victim or any witnesses with knowledge of the crime is not necessary when there is physical evidence. The usual way this happens is that police open an investigation, then DNA test the baby and the suspected father. It really is that simple. If you are not a medical provider or educator, you are probably not a [mandatory reporter](). But you can still take the same steps that they would and [make a report with DFCS](), or directly with your local police. It's still a crime. A 14 year old isn't old enough to give consent. Even without the support of the girl or her mother? Soon as they go to a Dr, the truth will come out. The girl is a child.  You can contact CPS. Any doctor seeing the child is going to be a mandatory reporter. Report this to the police and let them handle it.  If you’re aware of a crime you can report that crime to the police. Or in this case you might report to CPS.
