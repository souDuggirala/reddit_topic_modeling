 I know that Florida is an at-will employment state... but recently had a manager ask if I had hep-c...can this be asked or even discussed.... background... I do have it but denied it to manager,when before, I could even speak was told I would be terminated on the spot... I do my job and I do it very well ...never any complaints ....is there anything I can do to protect myself if fired? [removed] What line of work?
