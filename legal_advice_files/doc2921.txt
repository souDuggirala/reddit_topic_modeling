 I am receiving medical care due to a car accident. An uninsured motorist hit my mother-in-law's car while I was a passenger. Since the driver at fault has no insurance, I am going through my mother-in-law's auto insurance. They are giving me different answers as to what kind of claim I am legally allowed to make. I have been told that in Illinois it is illegal to have both a med pay claim and an uninsured motorist bodily injury claim. I have also been told that is not true, the med pay claim will cover up to 5k and the bodily injury claim covers the rest. They are already denying payments to providers, and I am afraid that if med pay does pay a provider, I will be unable to make a bodily injury claim. I don't have severe injuries, but I am definitely looking at more than 5k in medical bills. I am looking for a straight answer and where I can find more information, as I don't know where to research this. Usually once med pay is exhausted, then uninsured kicks in. You cannot usually use UIM until you've exhausted other coverage.
