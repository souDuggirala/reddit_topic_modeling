 Ok, long story short she makes roughly 5k a month. Over half of that being cash under the table, she works at a bar on the weekends. Or so she says. She does this so when we’re in court she can get more out of me for CS. I’m not complaining about supporting our child, but she makes easily more money than I do and I’m very close to 40/60, eventually 50/50. She used to do this with her parents as well seeing as they own a business they paid her a wage so she could max out mat leave. But she never actually worked. Feeling defeated and searching for help. I’ve called the cra and literally nothing has happened.  In the US, this could be considered income fraud. If she isn't paying taxes on what she's getting under the table she's evading taxes and that is illegal. Call up the IRS or whatever the canadian version of it is and let them know whats up. If you can prove she's getting cash under the table, then the court can impute income to her for support purposes. But realistically this is "get a lawyer" territory if you want to pursue it. What are my options, what can I do? Sorry I guess I never really asked.  What's your legal question?
