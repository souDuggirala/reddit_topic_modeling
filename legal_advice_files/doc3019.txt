 Is/are there any Federal law(s) that requires doctor’s offices to annually drug test patients who receive schedule 2 medication? Thanks! "4731-11-11 Standards and procedures for review of "Ohio Automated Rx Reporting System" (OARRS). 3. A physician shall obtain and review an OARRS report when any of the following red flags pertain to the patient: f. Having a drug screen result that is inconsistent with the treatment plan or refusing to participate in a drug screen" [http://codes.ohio.gov/oac/4731-11](http://codes.ohio.gov/oac/4731-11) I’m in Ohio too and I can’t really find any solid info on this. Do you know the Ohio law that mandates this? IANAL: But many practices have gone to drug testing. Ex: my aunt works for s practice that tests anyone who receives pain meds and the likes.  With the way you phrased your reply other people may assume that there is no law at all, when it is, in fact, at the state level. Many people assume that controlled substances are only covered by federal law, when state's also have their own laws governing them. I've had to correct a few people about this because they are convinced that if there is no federal law then what the state wants to do is illegal. OP was asking about federal laws.  Depending on the state, there is a law. Ohio has one. I believe it is at the state level that is requiring it. I live in Ohio and am on Adderall and I have to get tested annually for it to make sure I'm compliant with the medication. It depends on your state, the DEA might have also issued a directive requiring doctors to do this but that is something to ask them. You can refuse to submit, and they can then dismiss you from the practice. No law, this is a matter of best practice and organizational policies. It is common and legal to do so, but for some patients it is not needed.  Do you receive either medicare or medicaid?
