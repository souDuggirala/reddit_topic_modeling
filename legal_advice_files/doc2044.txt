 My mom has not ate or drank anything in the last 3 days. She keeps saying she just doesn’t want to eat and will not give us anymore details. We believe she has a mental illness for at least the last 30 years. She has never acknowledged it and has refused any sort of intervention in the past. Several family members have attempted to get her to eat but no one has been successful yet. I’m afraid my dad who lives with her will be in trouble if she continues not to eat. Can we force her to eat? Should we go against her wishes and take her to the ER or involve the authorities?  Call the police there and have them perform a welfare check, they'll head over and see how she's doing Google ncdhhs mental health crisis team for services in your area. They'll most likely send a mobile unit to assess your Mom's situation and determine the next appropriate steps. They are mental health professionals, much less invasive and threatening than law enforcement, providing help with dignity. They might be able to coordinate a plan without having to force your Mom into anything. Refusing food and water, sounds like she's a danger to herself. This is beyond your Dad possibly getting in trouble. Please continue to seek help for your family. Best wishes. Call 911 or adult protective services and make a complaint. She lives in North Carolina  Where are you located? Local laws vary. I wouldn't physically force her to go to the ER. You may need to contact local authorities to perform a "wellfare check" and have her involuntarily committed for a mental health evaluation.
