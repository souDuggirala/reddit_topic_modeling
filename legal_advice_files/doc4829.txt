 This is in Texas. Long story short, my dad got scammed out of a sale, then un-scammed himself by going to a local courthouse with his scammer. My dad has poor English skills, so I'm afraid the other party might still have gotten advantage of him. The only thing he has to show for his time at the courthouse is [this written contract]() signed by both parties. The other party has not paid since the initial payment, apparently changed address, and won't respond to any phonecalls. Is the contract legally binding? Should he sue, go to local police, etc.? Typos don’t invalidate a contract, so long as the intention of the parties is clear it’s enforceable. It is not however a criminal matter, so as noted above, small claims is your remedy. Will the typos matter? Sure that's binding, your father can go to small claims court with this and sue the other party for the amount owed.
