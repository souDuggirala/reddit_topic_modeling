 My license was suspended for failing to pay for two speeding tickets. I didn't realize that I had to surrender my license at the start of my suspension. The suspension (had I followed the instructions) will be ending in five days. What repercussions should I be expecting? I plan to go to the DMV tomorrow. I live in downtown Chicago.
