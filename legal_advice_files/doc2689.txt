 okay so my girlfriend went to her phone carrier to switch out her phone for a new one. she was unsure of her password to completely wipe the phone clean. so the person working said he would take care of it. come to find out a couple months later he had recovered all her photos(explicit ones) and put them on to his phone. we had just found out last week because he decided to show one of his co workers who then informed us that he had the pictures of her.  Personally canâ€™t locate a revenge porn law in effect for MA at current time. You would be well served to visit a police department or give it a call and ask for their guidance in filling out a police report massachusetts  We need to know what state you are in to check if it has revenge porn laws. If there are revenge porn laws, then he possibly committed a felony which you could file a police report on. I don't really have any advice to offer you, but I do have a warning for everyone: BE SURE TO SECURE OR REMOVE ANY SENSITIVE PHOTOS/MEDIA ON YOUR PHONE BEFORE LEAVING IT WITH ANOTHER COMPANY OR INDIVIDUAL. I knew a guy who worked at a major cell carrier's store a few years ago, where they also did repairs. He would have customers leave their phones with him to fix them, and would go through their pictures and save them to his own personal SD card. It was pretty fucked up.  You should file a police report and a complaint with the retailer. I am not sure the law has caught up with technology in this case. Depending on your location, it may fall under "revenge porn laws" which actually are less about revenge and more about sharing with unauthorized parties.
