 I moved out to Dallas TX back in mid October and hired a moving company to get all my stuff in storage over to my new apartment (old military injuries would have made the several trips up and down the stairs too painful). The move itself was great but an incident happened during the process and one of the dolly's the workers were using to move my stuff tipped and hit the side of my car (parking spots are in front of the unit but there is easily enough space to move anything between them). Ended up being a good sized dent that would require some repainting to get the scuff mark of the dolly out. Figured it was an easy report to the company owners that an incident occurred during the move and I would like to start the process on getting my car fixed. Sent them the pictures of the damage, got them a quote from a local auto body shop and they got back to me saying that the "Released Rate Liability" coverage on my moving contract only covers about $48 to the damaged part on my car. They asked me for what the weight of that part of the vehicle is and just ended up telling me they put 200lbs on the form with their insurance. Well that did not sit right with me so I did a bit of research on "Released Rate Liability" and found that really only applies to my stuff that was moved, not my lawfully parked car. Talked to them about maybe they filed the claim in error as they are a small company and did not sound like they knew what they were doing the times I talked to them. But now they say that the workers that moved my stuff were independent contractors and that I should have called the police and filed a report against their worker and that they have no liability at all in this process. So not I have a dented car and questioning what do I do from here. Thinking this will be a small claims issue but I have never filed anything like that in my life so I am hoping you fine folks can help give some guidance.
