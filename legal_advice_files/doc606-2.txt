Was on a cam site and another user came into the room and said that the cammer in question said they were going to sue that person for recording a Skype call they did. Person was trying to get others in the room to leave and not tip the cam girl. The person who recorded it said that they only recorded for 53 seconds before the other person (cam girl) noticed and then disconnected. Is the cam girl really going to sue them? Why did she threaten to sue first thing if that's the case? Apparently, he paid $70 for a certain number of minutes. What is she going to sue them for? Recording the call? Does she even know how this person is? What is the value of one these sessions, like 20 bucks? Do you honestly think she's going to hunt down someone to sue them over that?
