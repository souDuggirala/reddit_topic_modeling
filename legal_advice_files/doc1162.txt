 My landlord put a notice on my door (everyone's, not just mine) saying they're coming in from x-y time tomorrow (barely 24 hr notice). My fianc√© and I will both be at work. Can my landlord come in anyway? Or do they have to wait until we come home? Apartment housing in California, lease is month-to-month. I think in my lease it says they can come in uninvited with 24 hr notice or in emergencies. You said it yourself : 24 hours __or in case of emergency__. Yes they can Yes. Of course they can.
