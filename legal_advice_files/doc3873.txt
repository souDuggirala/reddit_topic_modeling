 I hope this is a quick question and that i'm in the right place. In Texas, USA. My company is working with an older building for our office. It was built in the mid 1990s. We have had portable toilets (of the regular size)) brought in due to all the plumbing issues. Our remaining 'running' men's restroom has been temporarily closed until further notice today. We have only had a single working disabled stall in the men's restroom for a while. Our office has over 700 employees. We have several men who are required to use the disability stall. When asked what to do about lack of accessible bathrooms, the men are told to wait until the unknown time the men's room is running, or go home without wages. I can't find anything specific on OSHA rules for accessible toilets, and I am having trouble navigating A.D.A. rules. Is this a violation? I enjoy my job, I don't want anything bad to happen because of my question or any attention I draw. They have brought in accessible portable toilets in the past. I would hope if this is a violation they would acknowledge it and correct it by bringing in an accessible toilet without having to get the government involved. Generally, if they are aware of violations, they fix it. (I hope this is the appropriate flare as well. Thank you) [removed] Consider calling the health and sanitation department if there are no accessable portable toilets.
