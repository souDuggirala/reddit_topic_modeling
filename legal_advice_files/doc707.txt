 What are NY state laws regarding reimbursements? I worked for a company in 2017 and incurred over 3k in (verbally) approved expenses. We had a falling out over the summer and I left, with them knowing that there were more expenses to be submitted. I submitted my expenses in December, at which point they told me that books were closed and that I should have followed “company policy” (which did not exist at the time I worked for them). The company was unincorporated at the time I was employed and most agreements were made via text and verbal communication, but I have concrete promises to reimburse travel expenses and a lot of vague contextual information backing up our verbal agreement to reimburse additional expenses (as well as text of conversations where the owner displays flagrant willingness to disregard verbal and written agreements out of sheer spite). Our correspondence also demonstrates a certain willingness on her part to disregard unwritten verbal agreements (she asks me if we had a written agreement in an email chastising me for submitting late, with a wording that I believe demonstrates that she’s more interested in making sure that I don’t have anything on her than in making sure she follows the agreement). What are my legal options? Did I sacrifice my claim to reimbursement by submitting late? What are they liable for?
