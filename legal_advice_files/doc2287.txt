  I read the rules and I'm still unsure where this post belongs, but I just really need some good, solid, unbiased advise. I live in Ar. and my son, til just recently lived with his father and step-mother in Mo. He moved here with me because his father kicked him out. He is 15 years old, and his step-mom woke up to him masterbating beside her bed. While I am appalled by this and know he needs counseling, I think there's more to this. I found messages in his messenger dating 2 years back from her to him telling him that if he waited up for her he could sleep with her. Apparently this was not an uncommon occurance. Well a month ago her and I got into an argument via text, and she then reported my son to the police. After he'd been living with me for a few months. A detective called me and said they had to talk to him and that I could either drive him there (5 hrs.) away, or they would come get him. I am at a loss here and scared for my son. I know that it is serious, and there should be reprocussion, but at what cost? I feel like she told out of spite, and that it is strange for a 12 year old to be sleeping with their step parent anyway. Please give me some thoughts.
