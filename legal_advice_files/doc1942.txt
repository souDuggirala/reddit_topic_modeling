 I am unsure if this belongs here but please bear with me. Last December I filled out the information required to apply for a study abroad program but purposely did not press the submit button. For some reason, the next day the application said I was accepted and I owed $400 dollars to the study abroad center and had 7 days to pay it or my registration would be put on hold. I did not see these emails. I reviewed the study abroad activity log and my email and no where did it send me a confirmation that I had submitted my application. Is there anything I can do so I will not have to pay? I cant find any evidence that I pressed submit.
