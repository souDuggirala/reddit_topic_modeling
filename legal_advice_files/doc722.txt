 I had a mechanic tune up my car before I attempted to sell it. The piece in my sunroof that pushed the windguard down for closing broke. While messing with it; the motor system broke. My mechanic is claiming that even thought it broke in his care while he was working on it, he isnâ€™t responsible for it. Is there anything I can do? Or am I stuck with a broke sunroof now?
