 I live in KY, USA I asked my union rep if the company still paid unused time off if i quit without a full 2 weeks notice she said YES. I Did end up quitting, and now my former boss is saying they DON'T pay out my unused time off hours, because i quit without notice. What do i do here?  Talk to the union rep again, this is their battle to fight.
