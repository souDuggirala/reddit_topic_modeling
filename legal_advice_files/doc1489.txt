 Hey everyone, hopefully I can get some advice for this situation. Before we met, my girlfriend bought a car through a local dealership. She financed the car for $11k. She later found that the value of the car in good condition was significantly lower than that and that the car has a few problems as well. I can agree that she should have done more research. Recently, a friend of hers started working at this dealership, and to make a long story short, had a conversation with the salesman in which he said that he knew it wasn't worth $11k and knew he was selling an overvalued, terrible car on purpose. Does she have any form of legal recourse here? I'm thinking not, as she agreed to purchase the car "as is" and everything, but figured I would ask since you guys are so great. We live in North Dakota if it matters. Basically exactly what I expected to hear. Thanks for the response. Nope, buyer remorse has no legal standing. Your girlfriend agreed to pay that price. What exactly do you think is illegal about that?
