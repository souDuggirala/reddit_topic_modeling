 My boyfriend worked for a repossession company. He was driving a nice car that had been repossessed without permission of the company. He wrecked the car. Told work. They fired him and said they may be pressing charges. What charges could he get for this?  In general I would expect this to be charged like joyriding ([LA Rev Statutes 14:68-4]()), and certainly he will be civilly responsible for the damage. The legal owner (I assume a bank) is going to sue the repo company for the damage done by their employee, and they'll pursue him for that money.   He did not have permission to drive the car. He had repossessed it weeks ago and it was on the lot and he took it out for a spin. He’s at fault for the accident, he hit the car in front of him. He shouldn’t have been driving the car.  How did he hit the other car? Was he speeding or otherwise messing around in the fancy car? Was the accident even his fault? He was supposed to be driving the car at the time right? He was on the interstate and hit another car. Was not on drugs. That depends on how he wrecked the car.  Theft, destruction of property, lots of things. He should start calling some defense lawyers in case they do press charges.
