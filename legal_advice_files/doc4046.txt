 Last year my grandmother transferred $100,000 into my name for the purpose of paying my tuition. My mother’s name is also on their because she’s my guardian. I don’t know the specifics about the account as it was done by my parents and my grandmother without me being involved. My mother and I have never gotten along, but recently our relationship has only gotten worse. My spring term bill is going to be due mid January and I have no idea what I’m going to do now. Do I have any legal claim to this money or is it out of my control? Also I’m 19 if that affects anything I'm sorry to hear that.  Idk how these things work but I believe it’s under my mothers name with her listed as my custodian. It’s intended for me as my name was on all the papers I’ve seen about it but my mother said something about it being a custodial account and she’s refusing to give me access. When I get done the semester I’m going to go to the bank and see what I can do. Sorry I don’t have very much precise information. I have almost no experience in finance or banking  My grandmother just passed away unfortunately.  If it's under your name and all your info, go to the holder of funds/financial institution and just access it that way. If you can get the name of it out of them.
