 TL;DR: MOTHER LIES TO ME ABOUT NOT RECEIVING INSURANCE REFUND. SO, FINALLY I CALL THEM AND THEY SAID THEY’VE REFUNDED ME ON DECEMBER 14th?????!!!!!!! New to reddit English not my first language. Sorry, need to vent. I am a university student and I use my mom’s insurance for medical purposes (dentist and psychology). Usually, how it goes is that I pay the service in full price and they refund (direct deposit) in the main insurer’s account (my mom’s account) and then, she transfers the money to me afterwards. I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD a problem FOR ABOUT 5 years. UNTIL I was recently diagnosed with Adult ADHD from the neuropsychologist. I PAID with my credit card 1600$ for his services (3 sessions of tests and questions). The insurance company promises me 1000$ refund. They usually refund the money pretty quickly. Less than a week. ALMOST ONE MONTH LATER, no news. I kept asking my mom if she had received anything or any calls from the insurance company and she would constantly say “NO, NO NEWS, NO REFUND BLABLA” So I call the insurance and they said that they’ve refunded me the money on December 14th. HOW DO I GET THE MONEY BACK? SHE SAYS THAT SHE DOES NOT HAVE THE MONEY AT THE MOMENT. Can I sue her in a small court claim? Thank you very much  Alright. Thank you for your answer. Her insurance is the only financial support that I get from her. I don’t live with her and she does not pay for my tuition either. I was looking in getting health insurance with my school to be cut off from her completely.  Probably you could sue. She could take you off her insurance and decline to provide any other kind of financial support.
