 Hi! I've recently moved from Washington to Tennessee. I took my car with me - it's paid off and I own it. There is an issue with the catalytic converter and the O2 sensor and it will not pass emissions. I am unable to change the plates to Tennessee, as an emissions tests is required to do so. I would like to sell my car since it's a 2001 and fixing it to pass emissions will be more work than it's worth at this point with over 200,000 miles. It was projected to cost upwards of $1000 and that's just not in my budget right now...I'd rather save some moneybuy a new (used) car. My question is: am I able to sell the car legally in Tennessee with a TN bill of sale/title transfer without updating the plates from WA to TN? Since I want to sell it to avoid having to repair it, having to repair it just to change the plates would kind of defeat the purpose. I just want to legally transfer the title and sell it without having to change the plates. Is that possible?
