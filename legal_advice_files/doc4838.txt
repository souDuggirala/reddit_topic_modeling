 Ok my mom just got t-boned. Car.accident. not her fault. I (male) passenger have my nm cannabis card as i am end-stage. The cop just took my card and is threathening with charges. Apparently because my weed isnt in the bag the dispensary provided. Can inrecord the interaction in new mexico? Advice?  Thank you.  ok Knock it off.  All you can do is go in front of the judge and explain your case.  Uea and odficer mcRetard just gave me a.citation The only violation is " possession of drug paraphernalia" Which according to  You still had 2 grams on you, without the dispensary label.  I have over 8 grams of weed. 2 grams on me and 6 at home in the dispensary approved package. The dispensary only provides 1 bag per sale. Which is at home Be polite and genuine with the police officer. The usual advice on here is to never speak to the police without a lawyer (and I’m not a lawyer), but if you advise you weren’t aware, apologise for your mistake, and explain it’s used for your pain management for your end-stage condition, they may let you go. Frankly, it’s not going to look good for a DA to prosecute a person at the end of their life for having their pot out of the dispensary bag. Good luck and best wishes.  [removed]  Did you have the dispensary label with your weed? Bomb squad officers are still cops. What are you complaining about? You broke the law. If you believe you have a valid defense go to court and present that argument to the judge. Nothing good is going to come of being a dick to the cop on the side of the road. The same laws also state i am capable of having all paraphenelia for medicinal use on my possession. I can provide.the package which is at home with the rest of my weed.. Also. Update. Citation given by a regional bomb squad. Should i ask for the badge number?  It looks like he is right... ...under "Transporting Marijuana"
