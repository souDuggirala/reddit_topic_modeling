 Posting this for my mom. My moms apartment complex is owned by a corporate company. my mom received a voicemail from the landlord saying she has not sent her rent money to the corporate company for the past two months due to a past due amount she has been paying on. She has a signed document from the landlord saying x amount is being added onto her rent until the past due is paid off. Can the landlord say my mom hasn't been paying rent due to this? She has all her receipts from the landlord put away. She is also on disability and has limited income.
