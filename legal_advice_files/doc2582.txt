 Hi, this happened in Minnesota. My sister in highschool got called down to the office, when she got down there she then went into a room with the police officer that is stationed at the school. She is a minor and got questioned all while being audio recorded. She was not informed that she was being recorded. Is it legal to interrogate a minor without consent from the parents first? She obviously didnt know she could refuse or ask for lawyer/legalguardian. understood, thanks for the quick replies The presence of a parent/guardian would only be required if she were being questioned as the suspect of a crime. She was a witness in this instance, so a parent/guardian is not required. Yes, the statement could be recorded without her permission.  No crime. She is 15. She was questioned on the Legal status of someone we know. What was she questioned about?  What was she questioned about? Is she a suspect in a crime? How old is she?
