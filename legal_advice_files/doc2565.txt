 My boyfriend and his ex share a 4 year old child together. For the past year my boyfriend and the ex have been battling in court over the mother relocating to another state with their child. My boyfriend won the case last month and was awarded attorney's fees. We have the affidavit of attorney's fees and cost from our lawyer stating the mother owes about $9k. My boyfriend was paying her $300 a month in child support and was ordered in Sept to pay $5k in arrears, so now his total is $400 per month. The payments get deducted from his check weekly and go to her. My question is, since she now has to pay him $9k in attorneys fees, can he have his child support order modified to where he is paying less per month, essentially cancelling out the debt until the $9k is paid off?   $9k is paid off? That's a question for his attorney. Though courts tend to treat child support as separate and distinct from other obligations.  Not unless the court authorized that. Money should be made to the designated intermediary to count.
