 My ex-wife and I have written into our agreement specifics about transport of kids between homes during regular weeks but no mention of who is responsible for holiday times. Absent of a specific call-out as to whether Dad or Mom is supposed to drop off kids to the other, what is the legal assumption? Is there case-law to support what is standard, absent an agreement in writing? For background, Mom drops off kids on Wednesday's. Dad (me) drop them off to school on Thursday's. Dad (me) picks up kids on Friday's and Dad (me) drops them off to school on Monday's. Aside from that, we don't have anything in the divorce agreement which calls-out who is responsible for which. Mom wants me to pick up and drop off kids during holidays because I don't live close enough to her liking. (sigh). Are you certain there isn't a general provision in your agreement about transportation? Any boilerplate that you based your agreement off of would almost certainly have included this. There is no official law or anything and there are a million different arrangements but it seems standard that the parent beginning his or her parenting time is responsible for transportation. (However, if you are the one who moved, she may have an argument that you should be responsible).
