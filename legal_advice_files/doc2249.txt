 Earlier this year I was charged with DUI and accepted a plea agreement. As part of the agreement I have to report to the court by letter every 6 months for the duration of my probation. All the agreement says is that I have to report my current address, phone number, and whether I'm working or attending school. So my question is, should I include anything else in my letter? This is my first one so I'm not sure if I should mention or talk about anything else. Nope. Keep it simple and stick to what they ask.
