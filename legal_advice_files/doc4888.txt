 I'm currently studying abroad in the UK, and I've already rescheduled my citizenship interview with USCIS once, from October 24 to December 1. I just found out that my appointment got moved to December 1 yesterday, and I will definitely not be in the US at the time - my semester ends on the 14th. Is it a really bad idea to reschedule twice? I've heard nightmare stories about USCIS and I don't know if risking it is worth it. I can fly back, it'll just cost a lot of money, more than the cost of application. Thank you in advance. I don’t know about this office specifically, but I will treat it like any other high-importance interview: find a day when you know you will be available and ask them for that day. At least you’re coming from a Western European nation—barring any weird criminal stuff, you’re probably almost in any way. Just find a day that works and don’t change it again
