The twins did not patent their idea , it was just a rough sketch they shared with mark. If mark hadn't don't anything with Facebook. They would have just dropped it, they never visioned it as much as zuck did . But mark ended up paying the twins. So is it like my friends can come and claim that they said the idea to me and start a lawsuit? Isn't that why patents were invented for such mistakes. What advantages did the twins have?.
