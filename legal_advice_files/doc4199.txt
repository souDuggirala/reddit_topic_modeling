 Link to original: Didn’t get any lawyers involved or go to court but thought this would be helpful. The moving company asked for more money after loading my stuff on their van and threatened to unload it on the street (it was raining) if I didn’t pay because they said it was taking more room than what I measured. Didn’t sign any paperwork stating a new amount, but paid with a credit card for half because it would cost me more to replace. After it arrived in WA, I had to pay cash and then called my credit card company to have them refund the overcharged amount. I scanned and sent them the copy of the paperwork I signed and had a security camera in my WA property record that I was paying the additional amount (voice too). The company never fought back against the credit card company so I ended up paying what originally wanted. Basically I think the movers didn’t care as much as the owner and didn’t get their paperwork correct to hustle me the right way. All conversations with the owner were over the phone because he was in Houston (moved from Dallas) and the movers just wanted to end their day (pick up and delivery were after 7PM). Sorry if my circumstances are unique and don’t apply but using my credit card saved my ass and thought it may help. TLDR: Paid half on my credit card and had the excess charges refunded from my credit card. Thank you for posting an update!
