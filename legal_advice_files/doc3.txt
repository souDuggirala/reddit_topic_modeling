 A few years ago, I moved out of my house and out of the country. My landlord mistakenly sent the security deposit check, which was in my name, to one of my roommates months later, and by the time it got to me, it had been dated 6 months and no bank where I was living would honor it. I contacted my landlord telling him the problem and he blatantly told me that he would not issue a new check or return my money. He has since changed his phone number and I have no way of contacting him, though I do know his whole name. I also still have the original check, uncashed obviously. I would like to know what I can do without hiring a lawyer and losing most of the check to associated fees. Thank you. Your remedy would be to sue in small claims. Already tried this, they told me I needed his permission. Unfortunately, it's likely that account is now closed or has no funds in it. Wouldn't hurt to try, though. Contact the bank it was issued off of. They should be able help get it reissued.
