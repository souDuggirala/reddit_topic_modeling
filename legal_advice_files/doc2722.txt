 So I have a friend who has a pretty awful family. He’s been abused physically (not super majorly i.e only bruises left) and emotionally by his parents but defends them. Recently his situation has gotten worse and my other friends and I aren’t sure about whether we should get CPS involved. We don’t have any video or audio recordings or pictures of marks left. All I have is screenshots detailing things that his dad has done to him. Main question: How much evidence do we need to make a solid case to CPS?/What’s bad enough to warrant making a report?  Talk to your school guidance counselor. They will talk to your friend without saying it was you who talked to them. If they have any cause for concern they legally must report it.  Any indication of abuse is enough to make a report. You don’t need evidence to make a report. They will look for evidence after the report is made. If you’re concerned for your friend, make the call or tell someone at the school so they can make the call.
