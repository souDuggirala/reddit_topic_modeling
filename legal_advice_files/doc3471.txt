 The end of 2018 I began having financial difficulties and started selling off my personal belongings on eBay. I am an avid TCG player/collector and had amassed a large collection around the $25,000 range. I was told by a friend I'd have to report my sales to the IRS and pay taxes on the items. After looking into I discovered that eBay automatically reports and sends a 1099 if I reach 200 sales and $20,000 in sales. I wanted to get ahead of the ball and do it right so I filed for a Sole Proprietorship DBA and reported my sales to Illinois, I had to collect IL taxes maybe twice during this time but all my sales are recorded there for 2018. I went well over the 200 item sales but ended up not reaching the $20,000 in sales. I wasn't previously aware of how the IRS treated online sales as garage sales depending on the circumstance. My final concern is since I tried to be preemptive and and the sales are already recorded state side I'll have to pay federal taxes even though these were my personal belongings?
