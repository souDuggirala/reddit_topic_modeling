 BACKSTORY: \[26M\] Attended Community College August 2012 - December 2014. Attended University January 2015 - December 2017. I had a full-time position locked in before graduation in December 2017. I am aware of the 6 month grace period, but wanted to aggressively pay my student loans off as fast as possible, so started dumping money into them early. All of them (or so I thought) go through Fed Loan Servicing, so I just log in each month to make my payments. I did not consolidate them, instead opting to pay them individually and have not missed a payment since the grace period ended. I just got an email from Turbo, whom I just filed my taxes with, saying that one of my loans is being sent to collections by my University. I questioned it because from my understanding, all of my loans are through Fed Loan Servicing. I pulled up Credit Karma and check my open accounts and, lo and behold, one of the accounts is through my university. Because of this, the payments I have been making to Fed Loan Servicing have not been contributing to this and am now currently 6 months delinquent on a loan I was not aware of. I pulled up my old student email, as well as my normal email, and have found not so much as a courtesy email regarding missed payments or that I owed anything to them at all. My question, simply: Is there any legal action I can take?   Legal action for what? It sounds like you had a loan and didn't pay that loan. It sounds like you should work something out with your university if they're willing or their collection agent if not.
