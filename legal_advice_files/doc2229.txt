 My roommate and I renewed our lease recently. Ten months left. Last week, a mutual friend of ours found out he has until the end of March to find new living arrangements (not an eviction.) My roommate wants to move him in here. I think it would be too crowded, but am willing to move out into a one-bedroom. The rental company will allow us to add our friend to the lease, but won't let him replace me on the lease or release me from the lease. My roommate and our friend are on board with me moving out and won't expect me to pay toward their rent or bills if I'm not living here. I trust them to keep up with rent and not get themselves evicted (if I didn't I wouldn't be considering this.) Are there any potential repercussions to just leaving my name on this lease until it expires despite no longer living there/renting a one-bedroom elsewhere that I'm overlooking?  're liable for damage, unpaid rent, and every other requirement and responsibility of the lease that you're still on. I'm aware of that, and don't think it's going to be an issue. They're both pretty responsible financially, and my roommate makes enough on his own to cover rent (he has a roommate so he has more money to spare, not because he -has- to.)  -bedroom elsewhere that I'm overlooking? You're liable for damage, unpaid rent, and every other requirement and responsibility of the lease that you're still on. That's why they don't mind adding someone else and they don't care that you're not physically there. Legally, they're just as protected.
