 I put in an offer today for my first home. I did a pre-offer inspection so I could waive my inspection contingency in this hot market. My broker and I spent all last night crafting the offer and going over details. My agent was going to submit the offer this morning, but a few hours before the offer review got notice from the listing agent that the listing agent was putting in her own offer and to pass any offers to her boss/broker. This seems like a total conflict of interest and perhaps is unethical; but am seeking advice about that. The listing agent would have a very good idea of who was interested and likely to make an offer. For example my agent asked the listing agent whether the seller would be willing to make repairs as an offer condition or not as we were crafting our offer. So she advised us there; and would know how that would play into our offer. Is this indeed unethical. We just found out another offer was accepted instead of ours. We won't know if it was her or not who got it until the house closes and it is recorded. If we do loose the offer to her, we feel upset at the lost inspection charges as well as our lost time to prepare all of the offer documentation. What, if any is my recourse here? If the agent has a conflict of interest, it's with regard to the seller, not you. The seller's agent doesn't represent you and has no duty to act in your best interest.  Still though, it's probably none.
