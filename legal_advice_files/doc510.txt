 Hello! I apologize if this isn’t the right place to post this but I haven’t been able to get any clear answers elsewhere. I moved to a new house about a year ago, and it’s a fantastic neighboorhood. We live near a school, so there’s a lot of young children. There’s also a park, so there’s always people riding bikes/running/walking their dogs/etc. There is a man in my neighborhood that drives extremely recklessly. Every time I’ve driven past him, he completely swerves to the side of the road (today he almost went onto the sidewalk and nearly hit the sign at the front of our cul-de-sac. We live off a main road so there’s a stoplight there, and every time I’ve seen him run the red light to turn left. I’ve seen it happen 9-10 times, all of my roommates have seen it happen many times as well. I’ve never actually seen him drive normally. I firmly believe that he’s driving drunk, but that’s just my guess. My question is if there’s anything I can, and who I can report this guy too. Obviously I know his address, but I’m scared for the well-being of the kids/elderly people in our little subdivision and I’d feel awful if anything happened that could’ve been prevented. Obviously I can call the police while he’s driving, but is there a way to report it after the fact? I don’t want to wait until it happens again to report it. Sorry if this seems stupid, I don’t know anything about legal things. TL;DR - reckless (possibly drunk) driver in my neighborhood filled with little kids. Is there anything/anyone i can report this to?
