 I was on oliday to Paris. I was walking thru a tight alley way and there was a painter painting some frame work. I had to squeeze by his ladder and accidentally nudged it causing him to spill yellow paint all over me and turned my new white shirt yellow. Suddenly out of nowhere police were chasing me and hit me with billy clubs for no reason and sprayed mace in my face. Do I have a case ? You can't be chased if you don't run. Your story makes no sense and it appears obvious now that you're trolling around the yellow vest thing. Yeah I feel stupid now how obvious it is. I do believe this is some manner of troll. They were chasing me like a crazed pack of dogs. All I saw was billy clubs swinging in the air and tear gas canisters whizzing by my head.  That would imply you ran. Why did you run from them? Oh that explains everything. LOL I was finally cornered. Would make a good "You want to Get Away Commercial" for the airlines. Did you open up a paper anywhere in the last couple of weeks? Where you by any coincidense anywhere near a yellowfest protest? I did. I told him no hard feelings as it was an accident. But half way back to the hotel before I could change into a new shirt, I ran into a group of policeman who for some reason just started chasing me. It was like they were mad at me for some reason. There is so much missing from this story. What do you mean do you have a case? You want to sue the French police? Did they arrest you or charge you with anything? Are you American? There really isn't a lot of detail here for anyone to go on.  Did you just up and start walking away from the scene of the paint spill?
