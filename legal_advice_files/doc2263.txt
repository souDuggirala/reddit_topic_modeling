 I have an ASUS Rog G551JW laptop that stopped working last week. I figured it was a broken adapter but I wasn't sure so I went to a computer repair store today to get the problem fixed. I showed the employee my laptop and its charger: a 19V, 6.32A adapter. He plugged in a universal laptop charger, and the laptop booted up, confirming that it was indeed a broken adapter. I asked him how much for an adapter, and he told me $30, so I bought one of those universal chargers. But when I tried to play video games, it turned out that the adapter had too little ampage: only up to 3.75A. As a result, something inside the laptop started burning and the laptop shut down and could no longer start up: The hard drive became unusable: attempting to start up the laptop led to the recovery options, even after placing it in another laptop. None of the recovery options worked. GPU and possibly other components no longer work: after attaching a hard drive from an old laptop, the Asus laptop's GPU no longer appears on the system information, nor did I see it in the BIOS. I was unable to connect to the internet by Ethernet or WiFi, but I am unsure if this is due to the old laptop's hard drive not having the correct drivers. So the product wasn't faulty, but because it didn't match it ended up bricking my laptop. Can I get compensation from the store that sold me the adapter? I don't think that low amperage would cause this. The only way I can imagine this being the actual cause is if the fan wasn't powered somehow. But that also seems unlikely, given that those fans use under 1 watt. And it does overheat, it has protection to keep from damaging itself. If you have a low power input like that, all that will happen is that it'll charge slowly.  Did you need data off the hard drive? You’re going to have to prove that the adapter caused the issue. The issue you described is unlikely to occur from low amperage. You’re better off buying a new laptop. Can you prove it...
