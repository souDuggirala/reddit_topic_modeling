 I'm trying to stop paying for a commercial gym membership that I was pushed into buying. I am only 18 and was naive. I am now trying to figure out a way for me to no longer pay for the membership they won't let me out of. Is closing my bank account a valid option to avoid the $250 cancellation fee? If not, do I have any other options?  't let me out of. Read your contract, looking for the specific cancellation procedure outlined in the contract, then follow it to a T. $250 cancellation fee? No. You'll just get sued or sent to collections. Changing the method of payment does not relieve you of your legal obligation to pay everything you agreed to pay under the terms of the contract -- it just makes it so that you can get sued or sent to collections. Read your contract, looking for the specific cancellation procedure outlined in the contract, then follow it to a T. They will send your past due bills to a collections agency. You signed a contract. Being 18 and "naive" isn't an excuse for not being aware of what you are agreeing to. Pay the cancellation fee and be done with it.
