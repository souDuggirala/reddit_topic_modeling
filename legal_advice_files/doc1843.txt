 There are tenants in other buildings on this 'Luxury' Apartment property who have been reported to leave their trash in the hallways of their building. The tenants of those buildings have complained and it seems the solution the management is to force enrollment of a 'Valet Trash' service to all tenants. They state they offer this service 'at no cost through the remainder of your current lease term. Upon your lease renewal, a monthly service charge of $30 will be included'. I understand that they could get away with the $30 following a lease renewal if it is written in the new lease - however I do not like how they are not giving an option of enrollment choice. I'm affected because the tenants in my building do not leave trash in their hallways, and my apartment unit is the closest to the trash compactor. Aside from searching for a new apartment complex following my lease renewal, what are my options regarding 'force opt-in' of a service based on the negligence of the targeted tenants? I read [this comment]() from another thread and am assuming as such: "Chances are your complex has entered into a contract with the trash service that guarantees the service the ability (and fee) to serve every unit in the complex. So chances are your landlord won't let you out, because he/she themselves aren't allowed to opt out any units." There's nothing you can do. If you don't want the service, you aren't required to renew your lease. NAL, and I don’t know your location, but mandatory “valet trash” fees of $20-30 per month are required by many apartments in the Dallas area. They aren’t optional and seem to be more common with higher-end and newer complexes. It’s irritating but seems to be a common part of the Texas apartment experience.  [removed]
