 On mobile so sorry for format. Basically the title but i was driving and I'm not a driver under her insurance. The street is a one way road and we were pulling out of taco bell there was no reason he should've been backing up at a red light on a one way road but doesnt matter since he says I hit him. Need help. It's her car and I've advised her to this. I got 2 one in front and one in rear Dash cam for next time. We've called both insurances and told them exactly what happened we didnt call the police though  Did you call the police? What did they say? Have you called your insurance? Iâ€™m thinking this guy is trying to scam you.
