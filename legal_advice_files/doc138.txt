 I got divorced back in 2016. Our property settlement doesn't set dates to have things removed. I realize now I should have done this, but didn't think things through. She has claim on a few items that are still in my house. Does she have to have them out by a certain date or do I have to hold on to them indefinitely until she claims them? I live in Connecticut if that helps. I would send notice via their last known address, (hopefully they subscribed to mail forwarding). Send it registered mail, so you will know if she received it. Then you also have proof that you tried to contact her with regards to the abandoned property before you disposed of it. Thanks for your response! Is there a reliable way to reach a person by mail if you're not sure where they live anymore? Sorry, I'm just trying to do this this right way, and I'm not sure where she's moved to since we split. Most states require that you give notice by mail or in person to the owner of the property giving them a reasonable amount of time to collect their property or it will be sold or disposed of at your will.
