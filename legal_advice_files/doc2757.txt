 So my apartment came with a parking space that I was given no choice but to pay for in my rental agreement. I don't own a car so the space is empty 99% of the time. I still like to have the option of letting friends and family use it when they're in town however. Recently, I've noticed that my landlord's family members have been parking in this space and seem very adamant that they're entitled to. Seeing as it's private property that I'm paying for, am I entitled to clamp their vehicles and charge a release fee? I'm aware this may not be the wisest thing to do diplomatically, but it's more of a hypothetical at the moment! No but you can call a tow truck  []() The National Transport Authority appear to have codes of practice for any aspiring clampers. Knock yourself out! If you have the mental cajones, the Clamping Act 2015 might have the answer to your question.
