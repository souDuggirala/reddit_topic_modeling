 Hello all, I got divorced \~2 years ago. In the agreement it says that I would be responsible for paying her credit card, which is solely in her name. I let her know that I only have \~$1200 left to pay. Its coming to the end of my having to pay what the agreement states, which is $5856. She came back with there still being $3500 left to pay, which is from interest. The agreement says that $5856 is the maximum that I will have to pay and does not mention interest, only that additional purchases shall not be paid. She emailed the mediator that we used and was sent paperwork that she could file with the court to let them decide. She informed me that if I don't agree to pay the interest she will do just that because she knows she'll win. She got the car, which I still had to pay. I asked for nothing from her. I only agreed the these terms because she was pregnant by another man and taking it to court would have taken it past the due date and I didn't want to be on the birth certificate. So, am I responsible for paying for the interest when the agreement has a maximum amount I have to pay and says nothing of interest? Is it worth it to take it to court? Thanks for the read. Hard to say for sure without seeing the whole document, but if it states that a maximum amount that you have to pay in dollars, I think you’ve got a pretty decent argument. Now if it says that you have to “pay off“ the credit card balance of stated amount, that’s different.
