 Just a little backstory, we own a condo and lived in the end unit so we have the last parking spot in the lot. an elderly woman who does not drive has her car parked next to ours and does not move it when it snows. Therefore, the snow plows do not plow our spot. this was very annoying but we just dealt with it because it was too much trouble to deal with this woman. She passed away in the summer so the car has been just sitting there (there might be a battle between her kids for the property). Now we live in our own house but rent out the condo and the tenant is complaining that their spot is not being plowed because that car is in the way. We contacted the Condo Association, but nothing has been done. What could be our next step? Or is it tenant screwed to never used the spot they/we pay for in the winter?
