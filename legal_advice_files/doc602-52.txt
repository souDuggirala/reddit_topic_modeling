First of all Im not quite sure it belongs here but I guess I need some explanation or guidance how to deal with this matter.

&amp;#x200B;

So today after watching an youtube video of a female  youtuber I searched her up on google to see her bio, as you might know google shows images straight away when you search someone's name, and as I glanced at the images of said youtuber, there was an image of a nude child, a full nudity photograph of a 6 or 7 year old girl.

&amp;#x200B;

I legit felt sick I don't know how to deal with this, as I clicked the '' Images tab '' there were tons, and I mean tons of these photos, and all from the same website, I searched up on google how to report child pornography but a lot of people say that I can get accused of difamation if i wrongfully accuse someone for child pornography.

I chose not to share the link or the website name here since I don't want to risk distributing possible child porn.

I did some research on the website ( without looking at a single picture I assure you  ) because I just got left stupid at how such site could exist without getting taken down, they have a '' Legal '' tab on their home page, that left me questioned if I'm way too sensitive or if it's just plain wrong and false, in such tab we can read : 

" Our site does contain some nude images and videos of children. Â Although some may rationalize their objection on arbitrary moral grounds, we endeavor to strictly adhere to U.S. law, under whose jurisdiction this site operates. "

So is it actually legal this website is blarring full nudity images of little child ?  

Also, I'm portuguese  and living in France, can I get in trouble just because I got in contact with this pictures ? Care I did not share, click in them or anything like that, I'm scared since the last thing I want is to get involved with justice for child pornography

&amp;#x200B; &gt; but a lot of people say that I can get accused of difamation if i wrongfully accuse someone for child pornography.

This is not true. In most jurisdictions, defamation is only applicable if you knowingly distribute false information. So long as you have a good-faith belief that this web site may be distributing child pornography, you are legally protected in reporting them to the appropriate authorities. [deleted] It's legal for the same reason that bathtub photos of your kids are legal. I'd report it, then forget about it.  [deleted] [deleted] if you're worried, report it, they'll look into it and decide whether further action is necessary. Stop going on the site.  Not every picture of a nude child is child pornography.

You can safely report the content [here](https://report.cybertip.org/). Generally speaking nude pictures that are not sexually explicit are not child pornography but that can vary by location. This is obviously bothering  you so stop doing this "research".
