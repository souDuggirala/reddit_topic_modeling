 So here's some context, a few of my friends were falsely accused of dealing drugs. So some other people in the school made a harmless meme with the main two names and that's pretty much it. We are juniors in high school and this incident got 4 people suspended after the school claimed "bullying" one of the people suspended was our valedictorian. Do they have any platform? This was the first offence from 3 of the people. [KY] Alright, that helps. Thanks! I'd agree if it was really bullying, but the meme in question was just the "who killed hannibal" picture with the word heroine in quotes. It wasn't really making fun of anyone Just looking for clarification. Some people were literally being bullies and you’re wondering if it’s okay for the school to punish them?  Nothing you can really legally do here. This is a schools decision based on an internal investigation. They didn't arrest you without cause. Can't really take action if there is a judgment call made against you based on a violation of the schools code of ethics or behavior. Likely needs to be resolved internally; if at all. This wouldn't really be the right forum for that.
