 Hello, I’m new to reddit because I need some advice. I accepted a job as an independent contractor for 7 months. During the hiring process, or before I started working, the terms have changed to 3 months, and I wasn’t made aware of this until the 3rd month of working (towards the end of the revised contract). I declined 2 job offers because I thought this job was a 7 month contract and I have evidence that it was. I heard something about wrongful hiring but I’m not sure if this applies. I’m at-will and paid hourly. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I signed many documents. The most relevant ones were a purchase order, a contractor's agreement, and a temporary worker's agreement. The contractor's agreement details that they can terminate me with or without cause. I can't find any contract that says that the term length was 3 months. I believed that my contract was 7 months because my original recruiter (she quit eventually) told me via email and through text that the initial contract is 7 months. According to my new recruiter, they have on record that the initial agreement was 7 months, but somewhere during the processing of my hiring, it became 3 months. My recruiter also told me it's not worth the trouble to dispute it because the client can end my assignment anyway for whatever reason, which I understand, but I feel like I should have known prior to be hired that this was going to change to 3 months. I'm not sure if this is some wrongful hiring or wrongful termination. And even if it was, i'm not sure if this is worth the trouble, but I'd still like to know. If you have a contract, you’re not at-will. Are you saying that the contract you signed had a term of 3 months, but you didn’t read before signing? Or did the contract not have a term length in it? Need more info.
