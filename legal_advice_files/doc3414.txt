 My wife’s sister passed leaving her niece with no living parents. Her 15 year old niece is now living with us while we figure things out. We want to apply for guardianship, but I’m an occasional cannabis user. My wife is a very infrequent user but has used it in the last 30 days too. We both work full time and have established careers and can easily take her in and she has expressed significant desire to be with us. What are the chances that the probate court is going to require us to take a drug test? Is it common? We were hoping to do this soon but I’m really worried I’ll ruin everything. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. If I had known all this would happen I would have made better choices, but here I am. Thanks After both my parents passed away my god parents were able to take guardianship of me and they where both cannabis users! There was no drug test. They only really worry about your financial stability!  In my experience probate won't require a drug test.
