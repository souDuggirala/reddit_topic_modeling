 A few months ago the courts granted me a protection order against my ex. Ex is to have no contact of any sort with me or go around the places listed on the order where I frequent. Well through the months we have had on and off contact. Me foolishly thinking ex would change and be a better partner. Ex is still the same, suprise suprise. Though that's beside the point.. Where do I stand in this legally for us having kept some contact. Could I potentially get into some sort of trouble or could ex use the times we've talked against me should it go back to court? As of now, I have made it clear to ex to not contact me or I will be notifying PD.
