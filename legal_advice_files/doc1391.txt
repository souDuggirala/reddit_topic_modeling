 I work for an organization that conducts anonymous phone-surveys for a number of state and national organizations (departments of heath, for example). Tonight one of our callers introduced himself, the purpose of the call, and asked how the respondent was doing tonight. The respondent stated they were going to commit suicide and hung up. The supervisor used the area code and prefix of the number called to try and track down the state and city/county/etc, then contact the non-emergency number to report the incident. I have a few concerns about this. Should we be contacting the non-emergency number or the emergency number? Should we be calling the state/area in question, or should be be calling our own local and state law enforcement so the issue can be handled between empowered agencies. Apparently the non-emergency personnel that answered the phone kept sighing and being impatient as though we were wasting their time and I feel like the discussion should have happened between law enforcement agents, so that it wouldn't have been (seemingly) blown off. I also feel like something as time sensitive as a possible suicide should have been handled as an emergency. I did some searches and couldn't find much in the way of information on the topic in general, and especially in terms of what the procedure for reporting should be. Any feedback and/or links to official resources on the topic would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
