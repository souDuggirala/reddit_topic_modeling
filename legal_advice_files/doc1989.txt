 Is it legal for a person in Nevada to record their own in person conversation with a boss? I assume they would probably violate their work agreement. But there would not normally be any discussion of proprietary devices or processes.  IANAL â€” Nevada is a one person consent state, as long as the conversation is private and only between the individual and their boss it does not have to be disclosed. However as soon as another person gets involved you have to notify.
