 I've lived in an apartment in the same neighborhood for like 17yrs and I've never heard this. My boyfriend asked because he thinks homeowners have to salt their sidewalks or they can be sued (that could be true, I have no idea, he lives with his Dad and his Dad rents the house so that's a whole different story anyway), and that must be true for apartments and landlords. He almost slipped a few times coming to visit me this morning, so that's why it came up. (Even if he could sue, he couldn't unless he broke a belonging or had to go to the hospital for an injury anyway, right?)

Do not reach out to a moderator personally, and do not reply to this message as a comment. Yes, this can happen. If the homeowners by law are responsible for removing snow from the sidewalks, then if they do a shoddy job and create a hazard that hurts someone, they can be held responsible. It's a form of negligence. It's also true that in such a lawsuit, you would be suing for actual damages, which would normally mean medical expenses for an injury. It could apply to belongings but that can bring up issues of contributory negligence, so it's not as clear.
