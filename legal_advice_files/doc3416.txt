 Hello I’m a student at a college in va, I was out of town visiting my girlfriend when someone kicked in both of my doors which led to the cops searching my house they found a guidebook on making magic mushrooms 2 spore jars and and a old beat up none growing monotube anymore with bits of growth in it. They called me and asked questions I accidentally said there mine but he never confirmed it was me on the phone and never said anything in person to the officer, I contacted an attorney but don’t have the money to get one on retainer. What’s my action here, they haven’t charged me with a crime they just told me to come in for questioning. So what’s my best legal action here, can what I said on the phone be used and should I go see them for questioning or wait until they can form a case thanks in advance i really don’t know who else to ask Well, what you shouldn't do is talk about your possession of illegal drugs and paraphernalia on social media. You should shut up and talk to no one but a criminal defense attorney who represents you. If you cannot afford one and are arrested ask for a PD. Don't go in for questioning unless your attorney recommends it and accompanies you, or you're arrested, and even then, you have the right not to be interrogated without your attorney present. Best course of action is to shut up and stop helping the police build a case against you, and wait for the next thing to happen. You certainly dont go in for questioning. You wait and see what happens. If you are charged with a crime, you hire an attorney. And you dont talk to anyone about this other than your attorney.
