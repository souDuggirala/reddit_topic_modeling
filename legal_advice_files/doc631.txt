 I have all my current bank statements scanned and shredded and the most recent physical copy I have is back from August of 2018. Can I still use it for proof of residency? I scan and shred/throw away most of my physical mail as I don't have that much room to store the paperwork. My bank statement is currently the only thing I have that has my name and address on int. I am in Hawaii if that matters. If you have an online account for your bank you may be able to get a statement from the website. Yea I have credit card statement from a different bank from the same month so that is why I was wondering if I would be able to use them since it has been a couple months http://www.hawaiicounty.gov/finance-vrl-acceptable-docs/ Looks like you need two items from the last column.  Just to renew my license The purpose might make a difference. Are you trying to register to vote or is there some other thing you are doing with the proof?
