 We live in South Carolina because my husband is stationed here but we are from Arizona. DMV sent my tags to Arizona address but now they are on their way to South Carolina in the mail. I have email proof that the car is in fact, registered and that I paid for the tags, but the tags haven’t arrived yet. Can I just show this to a cop that pulls me over? Like I said, they’re paid for and everything. I just don’t have the physical tags yet. Thank you in advance!  We can't predict what an officer will do. Carry proof that you paid for the tags; it won't hurt to show if you get pulled over
