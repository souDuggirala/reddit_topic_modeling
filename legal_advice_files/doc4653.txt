 Howdy all, apologies in advance for formatting but I'm on mobile. I work part time for a national company that does regular weekly events. I took a leave of absence for a while and resumed in September. Going through my bank accounts, I have not been paid since I returned. I've been in contact with my manager over a week ago, who reached out to HR, but I haven't heard a peep from anyone except to say that she reached out. The work is authorized, the company knows I'm back, none of my personal or banking information has changed, but I haven't been paid for the last 3 months, and am owed an excess of $600. I'm looking to file a wage complaint. I live in Delaware, the company is based in Colorado. I have performed these weekly events in both Delaware and in Pennsylvania. Do I have to file in CO, due to the company's location? Can I file in DE since this is where I live and do most of my work? Do I have to file separately in PA for the events conducted there? And lastly, I couldn't find the answer online, but is there a minimum amount of notice you have to give your employer, in order to allow them to correct the issue, before filing a complaint? In what circumstances are treble damages awarded, and is there a minimum notice for those? Thanks Have you tried to reach out to HR yourself? Do go ahead and file the claim, but also check with HR to make sure they have changed your status in their payroll system back to active. Also, does your manager know your pay is three months in arrears? They should be doing everything to remedy this!  You don't owe your employer notice. If they haven't paid by the pay date in which it was due, you can jump straight to filing the claim. You need to file in the location where you completed the work.
