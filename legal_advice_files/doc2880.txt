 I’m just wondering if my step father (who hasn’t legally adopted me or claimed me) is legally allowed to kick me out? (16 f) he’s emotionally abusive to me, my mother, and my 5 year old sister. I deal with mental health issues and repeatedly calls my psychotic and crazy. I’ve been kicked out 3 times before by him and he’s trying to kick me out again, I’m wondering of this is legally allowed as my mother has no knowledge right now that he’s trying to kick me out. We have had legal issues in the past because he has gotten physically violent with me before. I really don’t want to be on the street again. Is this legally acceptable? Absolutely not. You should tell your mother what is going on and contact CPS to make them aware of the situation as well.
