 Hello Reddit. I recently (today) bought a steam card from an online vendor for $25 in exchange for someone to give me a code for Minecraft on the switch. I gave him the code, and he then blocked me on discord. I have his discord and reddit if it helps, but I’m just wondering if there’s anything I can do... Don't give up, just learn from it as u/unammed_13 said above. Mods on populated subs can always be contacted and give you advice before you rush into a trade. I didn’t. Was too caught up in the good deal. Just s foolish mistake by myself  ok and did you actually add the user on steam and make sure it wasn't someone on discord impersonating this person? Because that would be my guess.  What steam rep are you talking about, link me I trusted them because they had +113/-0 on steam rep Thank you!  Don't give up just because you got scammed the first time, but use this experience to learn a lesson. Read the guide that this user made and make sure to understand what you did wrong, so the next time you would be able to recognized when someone is trying to scam you.

Thanks I just checked your post and you accepted an offer from someone that didn’t comment in your post. Move on and don’t sell/buy stuff without checking the rules of the subreddits that you are using.  Sue em You can sue them. But you don't know them and it isn't worth the time and money. Learn from it and move on
