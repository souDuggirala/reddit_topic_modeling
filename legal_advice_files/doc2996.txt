 So an in-law, some time back, had several BMW’s. One of which he lent to me and my wife for an extended period, and had the title transferred to me as he intended to eventually let us keep it. Then he comes back in need of the vehicle, so I get the title and sign it so it can be transferred. He has the title, but won’t have it transferred, and I don’t believe the car is insured. Is there a way I can have the title transferred out of my name without dealing with this guy?  Would this effectively take the car out of my name or would the title still be in my name.  Thank you kindly. Exactly what I’m looking for.  [Ohio Release of Liability](). Ohio  Location mega-super-matters.
