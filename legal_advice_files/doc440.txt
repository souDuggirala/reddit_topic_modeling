 Hello! My father has passed and I’m next of kin. He lived in New Orleans LA but his car title is from Seattle Washington and is under his name. I’m in Nebraska. I’m trying to get the title ultimately in my ex stepmom’s name, the car is at her house in New Orleans and she has offered to sell it on my behalf. I’m trying to figure out the next step and this is way out of my wheelhouse. Please let me know if you need any more details and thanks in advance to anybody who takes the time to read this! There was no will but I think as next of kin I am? My Dad was in OK with me in FL when he passed. I called the state title office in OK they directed me to a form on their website to print/mail in to get the title in my name. Then I was able to sign the updated title over to the new owner.  Who’s the executor of your father’s estate?
