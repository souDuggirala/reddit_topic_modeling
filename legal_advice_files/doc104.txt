 Don’t know what to do here. We live in California and have a big family. My sister is in her young 20s and constantly being singled out and harassed by our step mom. Every family occasion she is calling her names and putting her down in front of everybody. This happens in person and via text and it’s sad because my little sister has done nothing to bring this on. Step mom has 3 kids age 11-13 and is definitely more unstable after the 4 o’clock drink. Any advice? Understood. I don’t know what to tell her either that’s why I’m here I don't know what to tell you. Step mom has a right to be there. Sister has a right to be there. The law doesn't govern interpersonal relationships. They are not “hanging out”. My sister is just trying to be part of the family but is separated due to her being a “dick”. I know she doesn’t have to deal with her and yes they are both adults but it comes a time where this going on since she was 13 (10 years now) can hurt someone. The advice is for her to stop hanging out around the step mom and block her on social media/phone. Being a dick to people is not illegal on it's own, and your sister is a grown ass woman who doesn't have to deal with this woman if she doesn't want to. No threats against her safety or to cause physical harm. It may be in the wrong thread but I’m just wondering what advice to give my sister Are they threats? She can block her number any day. Harassing text messages should just be ignored? What's your legal question? Your sister is an adult in her 20s who is free to disengage from her stepmother any time she chooses. This is not a legal issue.
