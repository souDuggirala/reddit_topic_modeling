 I made a youtube video which has been blocked in all countries because it contains 10 seconds of the song "Little lies" by fleetwood mac. I am not making any profit off of the video. Does this count as fair use of the song? Oh well. From that description it doesn't sound like a valid fair use copyright exception. The purpose of the video was humorous. It was showing images of a software company announcing that one of their programs was now free, followed by images of the fine print showing that it was only free for personal/educational use. I figured that the song would be fitting. Yes, but youtube's copyright enforcement system is garbage and they're legally allowed to keep it that way. They can't successfully sue you but they can take down whatever videos they want. Even if it is fair use,YouTube is free to block it. Assessing whether your use of the excerpt might be fair use would require more context.  What was the purpose of the video? How was the clip used? What was the purpose of using the clip?
