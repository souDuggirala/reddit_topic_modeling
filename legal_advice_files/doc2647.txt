 I booked a flight to Istanbul yesterday through GoToGate via Skyscanner. About half an hour ago i had found out that i, ultimately, have no reason to go - as the initial reason has been scrapped. I had purchased the cancellation protection along with the ticket, thinking i had a safety net incase anything went wrong. However, upon reading their policy, they do not reimburse cancellations unless it is due to death/acute illness to me or a close family member; a medical certificate must be provided 5 days within the cancellation. Is there anything i can do to get my tickets refunded? p.s. apologies if this is in the wrong subreddit! Well, it's a DOT rule for US airlines and doesn't apply to third party purchases. That being said, some airlines (Delta, I believe) will extend it to midnight of the following day. You might as well contact the agent and try. Brutal. But thank you, i appreciate it Dang, thank you. i appreciate it yo it's been just over 24 hours since i purchased the ticket  Is it within 24 hours? Most airlines will void a ticket within 24 hours. You can throw yourself on the mercy of the agent and ask if they'll void it and return most of the fare. IANAL but have had this happen to me. You are out of a refund for sure, but I'd say still go to the destination. For refunds it will always be up to the airline. You can try calling them and changing the destination, or date (for a fee).  No, there is nothing you can do. Flight insurance doesnâ€™t cover changed minds.
