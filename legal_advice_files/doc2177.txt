 Posting from CA. Last Saturday Dec.29 my GF I noticed our stove wouldnâ€™t ignite. We also noticed we could not get any hot water. Our property manager later informed us (and the rest of our neighbors) that the gas has been temporarily shut off due to a potential gas leak. The gas company did not come until Tuesday (1/1/19) for inspection. After being here all day, the gas company was unable to locate the leak and apparently informed our property manager the gas would not be turned on until a leak was found and repaired. Our property manager hired plumbers to come and use some sort of specialized pressure tool to locate the gas leak. After TWO days, the leak has been repaired. A note was left on our door this evening indicating that the gas company has been contacted, however, they are refusing to come back out and inspect the property again until Monday 1/7/19. That will nearly be 9 days without hot water, and without use of our stove, or dryer. Our utilities include only electricity, NOT water or gas. Would I be wrong for asking for some sort of reimbursement due to this badly timed situation?
