 My child’s father pleaded guilty to a penal law 130.65 03 (Sexual Abuse to a child less than 11). He has not been sentence yet (next month). I have full custody, we share legal and he has visitations. What should I expect? What’s going to happen with our agreement? Does the court change it or I have to go after sentencing?  I believe based on the description that he pled to 130.66, Agg Sex Abuse 3. That's a D violent felony and he will be going away for at least 2 years, minus good time. Get your ducks in a row now, as far as filing for full legal and no visitation.  Yes, he has been convicted. Even sufficient evidence of pedophilia absent a conviction could do it, you have excellent standing to have the order changed.  OP, IANAL but would strongly recommend you talk to your attorney and to modify the visitation with this new information ASAP (assuming you do not want the father having any contact with your child as he may pose as a threat to your child's wellbeing).  I can change this Even if he hasn’t been sentenced yet? You need to file to have the order amended as soon as you possibly can. Get a family attorney, this is important.
