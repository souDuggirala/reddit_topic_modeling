 A few colleagues have been told to cease using their social media accounts made for our employer, but the employers didn’t make the accounts. All employees to my knowledge created the accounts for themselves, made the passwords, and verified their emails (which are company emails), and have used them as themselves. The colleagues in question were told to cease use due to negative feedback on those accounts, but some of those accounts have been in use for months already. All the followers, shares, likes, were all due to employee effort. We signed an NDA, but we never signed anything waiving rights to those accounts. If anything, wouldn’t independent social media services hold the rights? I’m meeting with my lawyer next week, but I’m trying to do a bit of research on my own.  I didn’t realize they could do this. Thank you.  anything created for your employer during your employment is theirs. They paid you for it.  You don't have to sign anything to give your employer permission to take an account that was created as part of your employment. In fact, your employer could just access the company e-mail account, reset the password and take control of it that way.  You got paid to create them. You don't get the account and the money -- you get one or the other, and the one you get (got) is the money. The fact that company emails were used to create the accounts is even more evidence that the accounts belong to the company, not the employees. By state law? Because as I said, we never signed anything. For all intents and purposes these accounts are off the books.  Yes. If the account was created for the employer through the course of their employment, the company owns the accounts and they must hand it over to the company.
