 Japanese website is selling a collectible and is advertising it as authentic and "new, never opened and box in excellent condition". The delivery IS insured for about twice what the item cost, before shipping tax if and I paid via paypal. Do I have any sort of buyer protections if: Item arrives damaged due to shipping Box is damaged due to shipping Item was not actually new, but secondhand Item turns out to be counterfeit If one of these cases happen and the company refuses to do anything about it, do I have any recourse? Would I go straight to Paypal/my credit card or the Postal Service (insurance)?  I already used Paypal to complete the order, but my CC is linked to the Paypal. Does that count? Use your credit card to make the purchase and you'll have those protections.
