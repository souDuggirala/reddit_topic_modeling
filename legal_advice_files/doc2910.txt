 As the title says, it has been 30 days since i moved out of my apartment and my landlord has yet to give me my deposit back or send me a bill for any damages. He doesn't respond to any form of contact what so ever. If im not mistaken he had 21 days from move out in WA state. What are my options to recoup my deposit if he keeps ghosting me.
