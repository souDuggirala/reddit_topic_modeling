Hello, does anyone have any experience with zoning variances? I know it varies significantly on a case by case basis, but what are the legal costs associated with this? Is it a difficult process? For example, asking for a variance to place more units on a property than the zoning ordinance currently allows? And/or, speak with a number of developers of similar projects in the area - they will have excellent, first hand information. The only way to get a real answer is to speak to several attorneys in your expected area.
