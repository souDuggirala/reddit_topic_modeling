 Hello, i'm trying to obtain an uncontested divorce in new york state and am confused about what papers need to be filed and in what order. If anyone has any knowledge about this it would be much appreciated. I cannot afford a lawyer so i'm trying to file all the paperwork myself. The justification for divorce is irretrievable breakdown of the relationship, we have no children, no joint property and are in agreement about how the marital assets will be split.  This provides a pretty good breakdown of what’s required: http://ww2.nycourts.gov/sites/default/files/document/files/2018-05/Divorce-Packet-Instructions.pdf Depending on your county it will cost you between ~$250-$350. It’s time-consuming and the process does require you to be organized, meticulous and to follow instructions exactly. But it is do-able.
