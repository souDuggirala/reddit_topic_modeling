 My understanding was that commission is not treated as "base" salary and cannot be taken into account for minimum wage? I have a base salary every week and monthly I received a commission check. If you take the hours I put in during a week and divide into my base salary, it comes out to being less than minimum wage per hour. So my company adds enough money to my salary to make that per hour rate equal minimum wage under a line that says "Minimum Wage Subsidy" However, when I get my monthly commission check, there is a line that says "Minimum Wage Subsidy Payback" in which they take all the extra pay from the previous month's checks and then deduct it from my commission. Check to check, its not a whole lot, but over the course of a year it adds up and I'm just now seeing it on my Year To Date column. If I do the math, then yes, over the entire year, my total salary divided by my hours worked comes out to more than minimum wage overall. It still rubs me the wrong way that they would go through the effort of doing that on my salary checks at all if they are just going to deduct it on my monthly commission? It seems like a total waste of time to do this unless there is a legal reason for doing this? If so, is it legal to then take that Subsidy back?  "base" salary and cannot be taken into account for minimum wage? Your understanding is incorrect. The test for whether this is legal is whether you are paid at least minimum wage on every paycheck - that is why they are doing what you describe. It seems to be met based on your description of their actions and your statement that every pay statement is at minimum wage or better. No legal issue or recourse here.  What you're describing is a "draw." Basically they're drawing on your future commissions to pay your (legally required) minimum wage during times your commission doesn't cover it.
