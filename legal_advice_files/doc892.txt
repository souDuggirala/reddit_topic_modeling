 Hi /r/legaladvice, the mailroom in our building was recently broken into where a man broke open the common mail door and stole a bunch of people's mail and packages. We watched the security footage and he was let in by a woman from our building in the middle of the night. She went down to let the guy in and they entered together. He left alone 15 minutes later where he stole the mail. We've suspected and have now come to learn that the woman, a tenant, is a prostitute. We have found her ads on escort sites using the same number she listed on her rental Form K. Her ads mention our building for her clients to come to visit. We've spoken to the police and have informed her landlord. The landlord seems to not care at all. The police officer in charge of our file is away so we're not sure what is happening there. Our primary question is if we have any legal recourse as the strata council to evict this tenant or get the landlord to evict the tenant. Or is there nothing we are allowed to do? We all want the tenant out ASAP. Thanks in advance for any advice. You have no standing to have this woman evicted and can't force her landlord to. The ONLY thing your Strata can do is enforce its bylaws. If this tenant's activities are a violation of a bylaw (which is a pretty big if), you can fine the owner. That's it.  You have no authority to force anyone to evict anyone. No one will be evicted for the simple fact of being a prostitute considering that is legal in your location. Whether or not advertising prostitution is something the police want to intervene upon or LL wants to evict for is totally up to the police and LL.
