 tl;dr Sister is a terrible human, heroine addict, she's homeless with 3 kids and i want to get them to a stable environment but i'm not sure how. My sister (I'll refer to her as Rebecca) is a habitual liar, thief and drug addict. She is 25 years old, hasn't had a job in years, has 3 kids and lives in a van. She has stolen from every member of my family, borrowed money and never paid it back. She has used her kids to get drugs. She's an objectively scummy person. I found out last week she was living in a van. Her kids (4, 2 and a year old) don't go to school, have no one to rely on for safety and support. Is there anything i can do legally to get these kids somewhere safe? I have a fair amount of money and i'm ready to use it to help these children out.  You didn't include your location but kinder isn't legally required in a lot of states and the child is still not school age.  Contact CPS (or equivalent) if you believe the children's situation is unsafe At their ages, they wouldn't be required to go to school, and only the oldest would be old enough for many preschool programs anyway. It doesn't affect the rest of the issues though Call CPS. You can call CPS and file a report if you are worried about their health or safety. Also, you do know they are not old enough to go to school right? So that isn't really an issue.
