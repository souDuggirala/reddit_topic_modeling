 Location: New York. As of right now I am employed part time by the SUNY Research Foundation, I am officially considered a 'research aid'. My work involves tutoring at the local high school and supporting teachers in classes over the course of the day. Recently one of the teachers that I work under requested that I apply to become a substitute teacher at the high school. The way that she described it, I would effectively be doing the same kind of work, i.e. helping her in class and tutoring students off on the side. This would also be a part time job, i.e. 7 hours a day, 5 days a week. The way that I see it, the best case scenario would be if I could be paid by both the Research Foundation and the high school for the same work; I would be paid as a research aid by the Research Foundation and as a substitute teacher by the high school, but it would be for the same hours/work to both parties. Would this be possible legally, or should I just take the job with the better pay to avoid legal ramifications?  Thatâ€™s what I figured, and that makes sense. Thank you. You can't "bill" both companies for the same hours worked. You're either "doing work" for one, or the other not both. If either company finds out you're doing this, you will most likely be sued to pay back the money you're double-dipping on.  Well, I guess I would be doing 35 hours a week of actual work, and then between both pay checks it would add up to 70 hours a week.  Are you going to work 70 hours a week?
