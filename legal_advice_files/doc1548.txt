 Long story short: I do not associate with one of my parents, and their family, because of multiple reasons (Ranging from severe abuse, to people just being assholes). One day during December, one of them rocked up, hassled my partner about where i was, about what I have said, and tried to enter our house. my partner grey rocked beauitfully. they told him they found me through "providence". I got grandma in my family to ring them, (they vaguely had contact a long time ago.) I was coming around to the idea that i would entertain them and see what they wanted, but they lost it, and they blamed my grandma for me not wanting them to see me, and refused to say anything about how they got my address other than "through providence." They were badgering my partner about what I have said to him about my sexual abuse. Every time someone knocks on my door i freak out now. There has been times, previously, when this family member has camped outside my childhood home for more than three hours while we were out. (We talked to our neighbours) Other than removing my address from the electoral roll and becoming a silent elector, is there anything else I can do? I have never reported my sexual abuse, but I have spoken to therapists, will this stand in my way about being a silent elector? Then why is being a silent elector an option? Them being on my property is enough to cause a severe relapse in my PTSD.I need to be able to prevent that to have any feeling of safety. Calling the cops will increase the retraumatization, which is what I want to avoid. Your address isn't meaningfully private information, but you can absolutely refuse to allow them on your property, whether you rent or own. If they do that again, don't let them in - keep the door shut, tell them to leave before you call the cops, and call emergency services if they don't leave promptly.
