 A couple weeks ago, I rear-ended another driver at low speed (\~5 mph) in stop-and-go traffic, in the rain. We pulled over, reviewed the damage (small scratches on their bumper, no damage to mine), and exchanged insurance information. I asked if everyone was okay; both the driver and their passenger said they were fine. The other driver had called the police non-emergency line, but when the police car came by, the other driver indicated that we didn't need any assistance, and the police left without recording anything. The other driver and I both have car insurance (same company, actually). The other driver filed a claim for damage to their bumper. I spoke with the insurance company over the phone, and gave my account of the accident (low speed rear-ending, no serious damage), which they indicated matched the other driver's account. This morning, I received a letter from lawyers claiming to represent the other driver in a claim for personal injuries. They are conducting an investigation into the accident, and are asking me to provide information (regarding my insurance, my account of the accident, any injuries, any damage to cars, and who I think was to blame for the accident). My inclination is to not respond to this letter, and report it to my insurance company so they can handle it. I already have my statement with the insurance company; I also have pictures from the accident of my car and the other driver's. Am I taking any risks by not responding to this letter directly? Other than reporting it to my insurance company and coordinating it with them, should I be doing anything else? No. You are absolutely doing the right thing by turning it over to your insurance company and letting them handle it.  Nope. Your instincts are perfect. Pass those pictures on to your insurance company along with the letter you received, and let them handle it.
