 I manage a hotel. We have a fund for employees that may need extra money for a number of reason. They are behind on rent or bills. They have an unexpected expense and so forth. Things have gone really well with people paying their debts until the last three months or so. Two employees owe money and it's become clear that they have no intention of paying their debt. I have papers signed that state the payment plan and that they agree to pay the full amount back. In this same document, it says the employees check may be withheld if they do not meet their obligation to pay their debt. I reached out to my boss, who has a soft spot and thinks we cannot legally withhold their money. Would I be legally in my rights to hold a check or take the owed amount from their check? It's not substantial enough to go to court over but rather the concept of no accountability. The thing that bothers me most is that I am being told to issue the same employees a Christmas bonus from the very fund they owe money to.  Thank you for your response and linking the website. I now know my next course of action.  Thank you for your response and linking the website. I now know my next course of action.   NAL- but Per [ this website ]() you can withhold pay for a loan. But how much per check, and if you yourself have the power to do so is still an unknown. Maine appears to [allow employers to withhold]() from employee's paychecks for unpaid debts to their employers.
