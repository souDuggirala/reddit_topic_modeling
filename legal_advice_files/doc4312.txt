  There is a book I have the electronic version of, but the original paper ones are nigh on impossible to find anywhere. Not expensive, I would buy them, they are straight up unavailable. So my question is, for personal use, would it be illegal to print said book? Obviously I would only print it once and not sell it or anything, but I am still unsure of the legality of it. I don't think location matters in this case but I live in the Czech Republic. It's illegal, but they aren't going to sue you for a single copy that you aren't selling.
