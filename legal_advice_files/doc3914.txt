 I don't know if this is the correct place to put this but I'm really frustrated. I recently got my first apartment, theirs a lot of baggage to that but this is the wrong subreddit for that so I'll leave it at that. On top of that stress when my At t installer arrives I ask him about my fiber and basically scoffs saying "We don't have fiber in this area." I'm flabbergasted, what? I was told left right up and down that was for sure what I was getting so I am very visibly upset and he tells me to call customer support. I do and they basically just tell me he was wrong and all they can do is downgrade my package and that they were sorry for the inconvenience. On top of all that they gave my a shit modem incapable of the speeds I'm paying for now (18 mbp) so now I have to deal with my lip dick speeds of 1 to 2 mpb per hour downloads on steam till my new modem gets here. I would honestly just cut ties with them if it wasn't for the fact I need internet for online school and basically everything else I do. Is there anything more I can do? Is there someone I can actually complain to at AT T about the blatant lying that happened and get a discount or at least a simplince of a real apology for the horrible time? 80 mpb was supposed to be my speed with fiber. my new package should be 18 mpb and doing a speed test tells me I do get that bit when attempting to downloading anything that is not the case, it barely gets to 2 mpb if that. I'm not really sure what modem it is, some moterola stock modem.  I'm lost. You want fiber, the installer says they don't have, but customer service says you do? So have it installed by someone different or go with a different company, if you have that option  A few things Iâ€™m curious about. What speed were you initially expecting? What speed does the package you actually got say? What type of modem did they provide? Have you ran an actual speed tests? Or just going on what steam downloads games at?
