 I have extensive info on a felony being committed by someone in Chile. Who should I contact to report this? (I dont speak any spanish) Thanks You could go speak to someone at their consulate and explain the situation if the perp is a citizen of Chile. You could also write a letter to the proper police force in the perp's district in Chile outlining your accusation. Don't get your hopes up. It all depends on what is going on and who the perp is.
