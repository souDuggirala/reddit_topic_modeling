 Moved into our home here in Oregon a year ago. The house is owned by a family who lives on Alaska so a local company takes care of renting it out and collecting rent and so on. Well about 6 months in the gal from the company in charge of the rental came over to do a general check up. My wife was home with our two kids, one of them was about a month old. The house was decently clean but not perfect (Tough to keep a house clean with two kids). And she just ripped into my wife and made her feel like complete shit. She called a good friend of hers who is a relator and was shocked and said that it was very unprofessional and not okay for her to make a comment on the cleanliness of the home unless it has hit an extreme (loads of garbage on the floor, animal feces, holes in the wall, ect.) There has been some repairs needed on the house (windows aren't updated and one was leaking). So she has had to come over a little more often than normal. Everytime she comes over she reminds us that she is going to see if we have gotten better at keeping the house clean. I lta just getting a little invasive and my wife is tired of feeling like the principle of the school is coming to put her in detention if the house isn't cleaned to perfection. Any thoughts?
