 Hi I live in Northern California and I am legally old enough to get a real job. I'm going to a online and trying to get a job so I can get my license (my parents want me to have a way to pay for my insurance before I take the test). I've applied to McDonald's, taco Bell, and bel-air. All of them say do you have a work permit I select yes because if I select no the application says you can't work here. Problem is my school said I can't have it until I'm offered a job so I haven't gotten it yet. I'm wondering if #1 do places I apply to look to see if I have a work permit? #2 is my school supposed to give me my permit? (All my grades are 75% and above, my schools minimum is 70%)
