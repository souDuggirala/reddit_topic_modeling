 [ALABAMA] context: She works in a meat processing plant which requires the workers to be on a production line for her position. Each department has a supervisor and each line within the departments have line leads. She made the supervisor and line lead aware of her need to go to the bathroom. They each said ok hold on pretty much and neither returned to relieve her from her duties to go to the bathroom. It got to the point where it was go or have an accident so she walked off the line and went and was back within 10-12 minutes. This time includes taking off and putting back on all PPE and work equipment and re sanitizing before returning back to the line. So she was not taking an excessive wasteful amount of time in the bathroom. When she returns her supervisor letâ€™s her know that she is going to be written up and takes her to the office and makes her sign a disciplinary paper and you can only have 3. Now she is in fear of going to the restroom and feels bad because she has this on her file when she was not leaving the line with any intent other than to quickly use the bathroom and return. Is there anything we can do to make them remove this from her employee file? Thanks for reading this. Legally? You can't control the internal processes by which the company keeps files, nor can you force them to "remove" any of that information. Believe it or not, there are plenty of positions wherein bathroom breaks are not permitted without a cover (air traffic controller, pilot, security guard, etc). If she has a medical condition that makes managing her bathroom breaks within the policies of the company impossible, she will need to provide proof and submit that to her superiors. Yes they do get a 45 minute break mid shift. Does she get breaks? Does she have a medical condition requiring more frequent bathroom breaks?
