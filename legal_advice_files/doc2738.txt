 I am currently unemployed, looking for work, and in a bind. So I owe some money to my university (which I no longer attend), and I've known about it and have been paying it down monthly for a time (seeing as my debt is larger than any one single paycheck I've received). Time goes on and I forget because, you know, life. 4 months no payment sent me to receiving a few formal typed letters from the Collections Office. I've had no communication with the university or the collections of this time because I'm mostly hoping that with my refund, some financial aid from a different school, and credit cards, I can eliminate this debt once I receive these payments. But what would be even better is if I received a one month extension on the deadline. In that one month I can expect to receive another financial aid payment (again, through a different school) that is more than enough to cover the debt (with my tax return and the first payment). Is it possible that I can ask for an extension on this debt? The university is a Public Ivy and the debt is around $1,800, which should tell you that no kid is missing class because of me and no teacher is losing tenure because of me. Thoughts? Thank you Perfect to hear! Update: I called today (the day of the deadline) and asked for an extension and got it. No questions, no hassle, no nothing. I’m so relieved. Thanks for your input, and I hope you’re doing well! Thank you! I'd call. That said, if you default, it'd likely take longer than 30 days for any huge negative ramifications to impact you. Call or mail? It’s about 8 days from now You can ask. They may or may not grant it.
