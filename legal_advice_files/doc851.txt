 Hey all! I was doing contract work for an insurance company in Oregon. I shared my wage with my coworkers recently. It got back to the managers and I was fired for discussing my wage. I know this is illegal for regular employees but is it legal to fire a contractor for sharing their wage? Thank you!  If it's the contract agency that fired you, file a complaint with the NLSB. They'll fall in love with you. Oregon is an at will state, but there are still laws to protect employees from certain things. They can’t fire full time employees for discussing wage. I don’t know what the laws are concerning contractors. I work through a contracting agency so I’m not sure. I was straight up told I was being fired for talking about my wage.  Um, if you are a contractor, you can't really be "fired". They can simply choose not to use your services anymore. What are the terms of your contract? The National Labor Relations Act allows employees to share salary. It's not illegal for anyone to and I'm pretty sure it's illegal to fire for this. I'm not sure if Oregon has at-will-employment, but if you do then you can be fired for no reason
