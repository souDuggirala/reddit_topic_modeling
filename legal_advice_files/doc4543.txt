 I have photos you can view [here]() Pretty much what the title says. My store manager and myself have voiced our concerns about this to upper management, with no response. I don’t want to sue my bosses, I just want the problem taken care of. However, even if I placed an anonymous call to the Health Department or to OSHA, I’ve read that there aren’t really any laws in Michigan protecting employees from hazards like mold. I’m curious if this is true and would like to explore my options.  Thank you for the advice. And I’m not really looking to sue, I just want the issue taken care of. It’s unsightly, bad for business, and can cause issues for customers who may have allergies. I like my job, I just wish my upper managers gave lower and middle management like me more authority on maintenance. But we have to keep badgering them to get things like this taken care of.   Of course there are workplace safety laws. If they didn't exist, neither would MIOSHA, which literally exists to enforce them. Just call them. BTW, you can't sue your employer for mold. Sorry. The most you can do if you develop an illness is to make a worker's comp claim.
