 Hello, long time lurker and first real post. Hope this is the right place. Posting for a friend Yesterday my friend (let's call him Steve) was supposed to receive a package from his friend from the states (My friend lives in Canada). It was a roughly 100$ headset. The package was not insured. Steve was home all day with his dogs and will bark if anyone approaches his house. He checks his package status that night and it says that it was delivered to the front door at a time when he was home and in the living room which is right next to his front door. Steve lives in a house that has video cameras and allows him to see the front door along with most of his street. He checked the feed plus minus one hour and there was no delivery van or person. Steve has asked his neighbors and they have not gotten anything from UPS. First, Steve called USP Canada and was told to contact the shipper and have him call to file a claim. Steves friend called and UPS USA and according to Steve they did not start an investigation and just gave him a bunch of information he already knew. What should Steve do now? tltd: USP said they delivered a package at a certain time with "proof of delivery". Video evidence that it was not delivered. UPS is not starting a lost package investigation  Long shot, but Steve can try to contact UPS and ask for the address where the package was delivered. This happened to me once and they were able to tell me over the phone that the package was dropped at 6823 whereas I live at 6283. Of course, that relies on someone not having found the package by now and kept it. Steve needs to contact UPS so they can investigate. These things take time. UPS handles millions of packages a day and errors may happen. This isn't a legal issue at this point.
