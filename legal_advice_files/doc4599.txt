 I was fact-checking this thread I was reading because the story, which was local and in my own local community, did not seem to add up, nor exist outside of fringe "news" websites and the original one. When I found the original website, the holes really began to show. The story is about a custody battle between a divorced couple over their transgender child. The mom is supportive, the dad is not. This website I stumbled across while fact checking, is clearly on the father's side. The weird thing is that it's completely anonymous, the creator vaguely says they're "close to the family" without saying how. There is also nothing on the website actually from the parents, nothing from the child. The only thing is a few court documents related to visitation and a motion for a restraining order...that look legit and the names of judges line up. It's almost got me thinking "Is even the dad aware of this?" I mean, whoever is this is posting legal documents with private informatton that aren't there's on the internet, and it almost feels like it could be without their consent. There's even fundraising stuff as well, that at least claims, to be for the dad's legal fees. If I was in either one of their shoes, I would not want a friend, and certainly not a stranger, doing this without my knowledge.  I think it's just bait to get people riled up at this point.
