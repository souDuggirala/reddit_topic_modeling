 I don't have much hope but I thought I could post it here: I recently (3 weeks) moved into a high rise luxury apartment in Jersey City. Everything was great initially and then I noticed there are constant weight drop noises coming from 2 floors up. Since they are weight drop sounds - its full of bass and it travels pretty far. I can't really sleep and it is really hurting my productivity at work. The floors within the apartment is also making noises when you step on them because they are not properly nailed down (hardwood). I do plan to speak with management, they have tried fixing the floor but its still making noises. I have yet to bring up the gym issue to the management. From speaking to other tenants, I doubt anything meaningful would happen. I signed one year lease and to break it, I have to pay 4000+. Do I stand a chance? I am literally going crazy over the noise. You'd likely have to try one and see if it helps.  would a white-noise machine work for heavy weight drop sounds? they are literally shaking the apartment. if it would help I will def get one OP- Might I suggest an inexpensive white-noise machine to help drown-out the sound(s) you're hearing at night? Start by sending an email or letter to management about the issue. If they don't fix it, then you might want to consult a landlord-tenant lawyer.
