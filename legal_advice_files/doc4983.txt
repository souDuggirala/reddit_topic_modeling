 I live in Canada, but I'm thinking maybe the reasoning/philosophy might be the same in other areas. I don't understand the philosophy behind multiple charges - two and sometimes more - charges that are partially or even sometimes wholly subsumed by the other charge(s). For example, in the news here, several students were charged with sexual assault with a weapon, group sexual assault, and sexual assault. In the case of the first and third charge, it would be logically impossible to commit the first without the third. Or in other words, the first charge logically and necessarily implies the third. So, it seems to me that being convicted of both of these charges for the same crime doesn't make sense. What's the legal philosophy behind this? Is it simply a matter of throwing as much as you can against the wall hoping something will stick? Give the jury or bench the ability to select which level of aggravation is most applicable to the accused.
