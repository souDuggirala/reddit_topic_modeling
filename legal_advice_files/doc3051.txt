 Long time lurker...first time posting. Not sure if this belongs here...so if you can show me to a more appropriate sub, I’d appreciate it. Sorry for the mobile formatting. Trying to help my mom out as she is lost on what to do. My mom couldn’t make the last payment on her hip replacement surgery. When she was struggling with the payments they told her if she didn’t pay she couldn’t come back. By the time she had the money together they had ripped off her bill because the balance was at zero. Now she’s having trouble but can’t go back. What should she do? Should she go to a new place? What if they ask about her other doctor? We both don’t know how this works. Thanks in advance.
