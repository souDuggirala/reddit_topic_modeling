 We called our landlord to give him a heads up that we were going to be giving him 30 days notice in writing tomorrow, and he said we would have to pay for the whole month of March. We believe we should only have to pay for the portion of March which falls in that 30 day period. Here is the language in our lease agreement: -payment of rent, in which event three (3) days notice shall be given and the Landlord reserves the right to demand and force immediate possession at the expiration of said three (3) days. Also, this was originally a 12-month lease that turned into a month-to-month after the original term expired. Any help would be appreciated!  Your landlord is correct, this is pretty standard.  By law, the tenancy ends on the next rent paying date not less than 30 days after the date the notice is received.
