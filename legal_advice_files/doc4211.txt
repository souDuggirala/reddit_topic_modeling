 Hey everybody. Apologize in advance for my ignorance and if this is the wrong place to post this, but I'm really worried and wanted to know what options exist. Long story short, an old friend of mine seems to be having an extreme break from reality, has holed up in a motel somewhere in KY (he and his whole family are from and live in Texas as far as I know), and is now spending his days making cryptic twitter posts about Q Anon, and alleging that his family and friends are all part of an evil cabal that are trying to have him killed, that we've all committed horrible crimes and he's going to stop us, etc. A few of the posts have been threatening, and I'm extremely worried he is either going to hurt a loved one, a stranger, or himself if he doesn't get help. Is there any sort of recourse for his friends and family to have authorities intervene? I know having people committed in this day and age is pretty tough, but he seems to be getting worse and worse, and I think he's also engaging in heavy drug use (his reddit account history shows a lot of activity in research chems subs) which I'm sure is exacerbating everything, and I will not be able to live with myself if I see him on the news as the latest mentally disturbed individual who hurt innocent people. Thanks for reading.
