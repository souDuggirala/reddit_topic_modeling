 This all happened in the late 80s, I am relaying information from my parents. My grandfather passed away many years ago, and more recently my grandmother passed. We were going through their documents and found a minerals right claim to a natural gas well on a piece of property they had owned previously. Purportedly, the gas company had set the well and leased their land, but never pumped any gas or paid any royalties then bought out the rights for a couple thousand dollars" after saying the well was a bust. My grandparents moved shortly after, a couple of years later my parents drove by the property and saw they had started pumping gas well. Do we have any rights to reclaim royalty payments? It seems like the gas company bought the mineral claim back in bad faith.
