 About 3 months ago I was pulled over for what the cop said was “speeding”. Going 60 in a 35. He also ticketed me for my tinted windows. I have a tracker in my car that said I was going 33 mph on the street he said he caught me speeding. Not to mention I was also able to physically see the cop about a block away before being pulled over, no one in their right mind would speed past a cop if they can literally see them. I was also coming from a dead stop near the side street he said he caught me speeding by laser. Fortunately I won’t have to appear in court and am given the options to pay the ticket or request a “trail by declaration”, which I’m doing. I’ve gathered all my evidence including the data from my tracker as well as pictures of a traffic cam from where I was stopped, pictures of the street, and the gps mapping from my tracker. Do I have a real shot at fighting this?  Probably not. The cop will have evidence regarding the calibration of his laser. Do you have any proof your "tracker" was properly calibrated on the day you received the ticket? No harm if you want to try, though. You don't pay extra if you lose in California, but the judge may not permit you to take traffic school to avoid the point.
