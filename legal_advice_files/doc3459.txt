 Co worker and personal friend of manager refers to Hispanic prisoners as “Paco” to their face, and much worse behind their back. The inmates are so shocked, they don’t say anything, she says this daily to nearly 100% of the inmates in front of the manager. I work for a large corporation with an anonymous reporting system. It’s a class action just waiting to happen imho. Is it reasonable to report this?
