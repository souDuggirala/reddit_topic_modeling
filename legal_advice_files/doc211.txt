 I have recently had a small claims court case filed against me and there are some old text messages between the plaintiff and myself that would help me in my case. I called AT T trying to request my records and after talking to a supervisor learned that they can produce the records but only with a subpoena. Since this case is civil my question is, how do I get a subpoena on my own cell phone records? I don't understand why this is a rule they have but it seems like the only option I have going forward to get these records. Thanks in advance for any advice :) Edit: Court case is filed in Orange County, Ca Awesome info — thanks again! Also, I dig your username  You’re welcome! And to clarify, you probably don’t need AT T to actually come to trial as a witness. You can check box 4b which says they can just send you the documents you are requesting in advance of trial along with a certification that you need to make the documents admissible evidence at trial. This way you know in advance of going into court what the documents will show.  We run into this issue with criminal cases. It can take awhile to get enough PC for a warrant or a court to get subpoena so we fire off the letter (they are familiar with them and probably even have a special fax number you send it to). Wow, didnt even cross my mind they might delete the data — thanks! Thank you! Thank you for your response! I would have never found that without you FYI, AT T will not save the messages for long. Usually, around 30 days and they delete the data. You need to send them a letter to retain the data until a subpoena can be obtained. You can have the small claims court issue a subpoena to AT T for them to come to trial and bring the text messages. See the instructions [here]().  Any lawyer can issue a subpoena. You will have to pay for an hour or two of their time.
