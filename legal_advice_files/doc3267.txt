 So leased a commercial property and put down a 20k deposit. The lease ended and they didnâ€™t want to return the deposit. My attorney started a suit, and they counterclaimed for 90k in damages. In the end we won a judgement of 15k of the deposit and won 35k in attorneys fees. They are now making payments of 1000 dollars per month. They most definitely have the money, as they are wealthy, but choose these payments. Another thing is, when the lease ended they never sent a receipt of the deposit for damages, until we started a lawsuit. The security deposit was to be held in trust, but during the trial we learned they deposited into their checking/savings account. So does having the money I won being related to security deposit change how it should be given back? Could I call the police and say they have wrongfully taken my security deposit and file charges for theft/fraud? Any advice or questions are welcome. Let me know if any important details needed, thank you and Merry Christmas. You should be asking your attorney. The time to dispute where they put the money or how they handled the end of your lease was when you had the judge's attention. The police aren't going to get involved. If you didn't want monthly payments you should have argued that option in court.
