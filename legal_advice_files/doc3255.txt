 Hello all, how am I supposed to know whether County Municipal Code applies versus City Municipal Code or even the state's?  Thanks for your help :) Thank you!  Thank you for your help. Generically all city code applies to all parts of the city. All county code applies to all parts of the county and all state codes apply to all parts of the state. So a property must adhere to all city, county and state codes. Local codes normally are more restrictive versions of the larger government bodies code. Usually the only time you need to refer to the county or state code is if the city code does not cover it. Generally, codes only apply within the confines of their limited jurisdictions. So city code is only applicable within city limits. County code is only applicable within the county. State within the state. More than one set of codes can apply to an area within two or more jurisdictions but not the other way around. So in the city limits you may have three sets of code in effect. But outside the limits, just county and state.  They all apply, to the extent they SAY they apply. The most restrictive controls.
