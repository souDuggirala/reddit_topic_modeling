 I have Â£42k in my bank, if I die will the government get all my money? I'd just prefer that my family would get it, or at least that it would be of some use. I'm 21. Also, I read on the internet that two signatures are required from other people to get a will - is there any way to avoid that and do it all myself? Ok great thanks Excellent thanks If you die without a will, your money and owned property will go into probate. It will be detemined if you have any heirs to your money and assets. Should you have heirs, siblings or immediate family it will go to them. If you dont it will go to the crown. In a union with work? Many offer will advice. You can have a will drawn up very easily and cheaply and some unions offer a free will service.  Without a will, your effects go to your next of kin, after paying off your creditors.
