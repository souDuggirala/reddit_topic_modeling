 Me and my wife have lived in an apartment since we got married in May. Ever since we moved in we have had trouble with our washer and dryer that was supplied by the landlord. The washer was clogged when I moved in and after many repeated attempts to get someone out to fix it I finally asked the leasing office if I could just go ahead and attempt to fix it myself since I am a fairly handy person and work maintenance for a living. I was successful in fixing our washer and have since reported on multiple occasions that our washer now has a leak. I have patched together the washer at least three separate times to fix leaks or adjust the drain lines. As of late, the building next to use has been experiencing a clogged sewer main line. The maintenance men routinely just open the "clean-out" on the side of the building and proceed to drain the raw sewage out into the grass by our door and let it flow through the parking lot. I have complained to the front desk multiple times about this and nothing has been done. Instead of fixing the problem they just open the valve and let it drain down into the grass and eventually all through the parking lot. After my initial complaint they now pick up the solid waste around the cleanout but nothing else. We are actively searching for a safer environment to live in and would like to be gone within two months. I currently have 4 months left on my lease. Do I have a legit case to get out of my lease before it ends?
