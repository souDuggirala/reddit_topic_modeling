 Location: Washington State I've lived at my current address for 6 months, and from what I heard as I was moving in, this unit was vacant for several months prior to that. Somehow, however, I continue to get 1-3 pieces of mail DAILY addressed to a former resident. Obviously I know not to open anything addressed to someone else but I'm wondering how much responsibility I have for this stuff beyond that. At first I was diligent about sending it all back with "Return to Sender, No Longer at this Address" or similar stuff written on the envelopes, especially if it looked important. But here's the thing: most of it doesn't seem important at all. It's almost invariably total junk. Quack health leaflets, super weird catalogs, "voluntary dues statements" for special interest groups, etc. A lot of it is political, but I've recognized both major parties and some very opposite causes represented, so I get the impression that this person was either very lonely and signed up for every mailing list they could find just to feel connected, or that it was someone's idea of a prank to sign them up for all this garbage. Here's an example of the most memorable piece... [Literal "junk" mail (NSFW)]() I don't have a forwarding address for this person and I'm sick of returning all this crap. I also tried putting a note in my mailbox requesting "Mail for (My Name) only, (Former Resident's Name) is no longer at this address" but that hasn't had any effect, even when I pointedly only bring in mail with my name on it (until it gets too full, obscures the note, and I empty it in frustration). At this point I just want to throw it all away, but I'm concerned I may open myself up to trouble if I throw away something important amidst all the junk. Legal minds of reddit, what should I do? Anything marked as to "or current resident" you can toss.  If it's not first class or has the phrase "service requested" (usually left side of the envelope) it will be thrown away by the post office
