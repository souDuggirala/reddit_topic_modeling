Self explanatory, the HOA charged me $600 and i can’t even call them vince they don’t open till monday. I need the money back, who do i call? Nothing is going to happen till Monday anyway. No one else is going to give you that money in the meantime before this is resolved with your HOA Either way you're not going to get your money back until Monday or Tuesday.  No one. If they are closed then you wait until Monday Dispute the charge maybe and find out what happened on Monday.
