 I dont want to take anti depressants and family threatens to contact police and lock me up in psych ward .can they do that? I'm 19 Country:Greece  He wouldn't it was a mistake on my part copying the wrong link jeez. why would he look for advice for uk, he's in Greece /r/LegalAdviceEU would be better. Yes they can contact the police, but to get thrown into the ward a bunch of people have to agree on the decision, not just your parents.
