 Hey guys; here on behalf of my girlfriend regarding her rape as a child. She finally filed charges against him as an adult. However, he may no longer be in the state or potentially no longer in the country. Not really sure, his last known address seems outdated. So my question is what happens if she turns 30 and he still hasn't been picked up for his warrant? I know she had until that age to report but is there a time limit now that the process has been started? Thanks in advance for your help. It's just frustrating that the initial reporting process / setting up detective interviews took forever, then a lot happened really fast (charges warrant) but since they couldn't find him we're just back to this long quiet period where we don't know what will happen next.  Thanks much Warrants in Washington state can only be vacated by the state. They do not expire, there are statutes of limitations once the process is started. Charges are multiple counts of rape of a child and incest. Warrant is for failure to appear. She has a victim's advocate assigned to her case for questions and whatnot but it stresses her out to contact them; hence trying to research first. Thank you, though. It depends on the charges. You need to reach out to the DA for this information.
