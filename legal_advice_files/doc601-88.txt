So to start off, I have no contact to my LL directly, only through a (dodgy) agency. 

I pay bills weekly, and within my bills I pay for WiFi. 21 days ago, the landlord (without any prior warning) turned off the broadband. The following day, I called my agency and they apparently tly contacted the LL who said that he would get right on it. After a week and a half of me trying to get the agency to sort it out, the met with him (9 days ago) who said he would get right on it... again. Following this, I contact the agency to make sure, and he apparently then called the broadband company 2 days after (so a week ago). They said it would be 3-5 days for the package to arrive, but despite this, no wifi has been installed and I am still without. 

Furthermore, I have still have had to pay full bills each week. The only compensation he has offered is a £10 reduction to this weeks bill only. I have had to spend £16 on extra data and have nearly missed work opportunities from a client and some personal things (like game tournaments I am a part of). 

Is there something I can do? He clearly lied the first time, and even with the fact that the wifi might arrive tomorrow, I still have had 3 weeks of paying for no wifi. 

TL:DR - Been paying for wifi for 3 weeks and haven't actually had wifi. LL has offered basically no compensation. What can I do?
