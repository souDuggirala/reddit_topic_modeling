 My parents live in California and recently they have been having issues with one of ours neighbours tenants, they have been parking along the street in front of their house effectively blocking the mailbox and the spot where they are supposed to put out the garbage cans. They aren't parking in front of the driveway but they are providing enough of a nuisance. According to my mom other neighbours have been having similar issues. There isn't a HOA in the area which could help them deal with this issue. I was just wondering if there is anything they can do legally to stop this from happening. My parents are pretty old and don't need to worry about this too. My parents are sending me pictures I'll post them as soon as I can.  Thanks man, Just spoke with their landlord they seem to have broken a lot of the terms of their lease and they’re being evicted soon.  If the street is public and there's no signs or parking permits indicating otherwise, they can park in front of your parents house. About the mailbox and garbage cans, you'd have to look up their specific city to see if there's a local ordinance about not blocking those things. Usually, there isn't. They MAY be able to have it towed if it’s blocking the mailbox. If talking to them doesn’t get anywhere they should look into whether having it towed is possible. Has anybody tried talking to them yet?
