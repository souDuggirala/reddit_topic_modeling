 I was walking downtown headed to a 9am meeting and walked behind a car that had pulled out of a parking ramp blocking the sidewalk. As I was watching my step (it was snowy/icy) the arm/gate of the parking ramp came down and hit me on the forehead. It broke the skin and although I maintained conciousness I was really shaken up. Had to get checked out for a concussion and have steristrips and glue applied to close the wound. I know it sounds horribly vain, but I'm super worried about scarring. I called the parking ramp mgt company at the suggestion of my doctor. They called it a "freak as accident" and apologized. Do I have any legal recourse for medical care? Future scar treatments? Headaches I pray are temporary? I'm pretty positive they have it on video, but they told me I was a foot or so out of camera range...I'm not sure I buy that. I honestly just didn't want to be standing in the street/two lane ramp driveway. I was already walking through the driveway when the car exited... Well, did you HAVE to walk behind the car, in the path of the arm or could you have waited on the car to move and continued on your way? I am NOT a lawyer, so this is only me asking questions. They may not be liable since you left the sidewalk and put yourself in the way of the arm. Cant figure out how to edit the title on my mobile. Location: USA (MN)
