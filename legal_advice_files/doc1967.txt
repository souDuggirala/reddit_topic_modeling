 Location: Golden, CO I was living in university apartment. It is a 2-bedroom apartment. When I moved in in the beginning of the semester (September), no one was living in the other bedroom. So, I set up the Xcel energy(heat and energy provider) account. Two weeks after, university apartment director email me that the next day or two there will be someone move into the other bedroom. After this first monthly bill came out, I asked him to pay 1/3 of the bill since he just moved in only 2 weeks. At the end of the semester(end of the year), I transferred to other school in other state and he still hasn't pay his portion of the bill for the last 2 (or 3 months) months. I paid the Xcel the full amount, since I am the owner of the account. I talked to the apartment director and Student's Life office director, and they told me they can only told him to pay me, Period. Then told me to go to the court if I want my roommate to pay. What can I do to get him to pay me? I looked up some info about Small Claim Court. I was wondering do I need to fly there to get my money back? Thank you everyone. Even if you were in the same area, suing over $150 is barely worth it. You being in another state only complicates things more. Basically it'll cost you more than $150, and even if you get a judgement, the old roommate may not just write you a check and throw in the towel.  Less than $150 How much does he owe for this bill?
