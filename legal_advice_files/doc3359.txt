 My girlfriend recently found out that a girl has been spreading rumours about my girlfriend being a stripper, doing webcam things and guys “fucking her one by one” at parties. None of this is true, and my girlfriend thinks shes spreading these due to my gf being close friends with her ex bf. I mean, perhaps i’m exagerating but some ppl can be seriously affected and end up killing themselves because people will hear the rumour and believe it and ruin the affected persons’s life. Is there anything that can be done legally for some sort of defamation or anything? Im sure we can gather evidence if we tried hard by looking for msgs she has sent people. Is there a point in even trying something legally? Man... it does. Suicide is not a joke. But you asked what can legally be done. Bullying in any form might be shitty, but it is not illegal. If she did kill herself, you'd have to consult a lawyer and they could advise you, but even then you wouldn't have much of a case, again because bullying is not a crime. Harassment, yes, assault, yes, but spreading rumors, no. This is not the middle ages and you need hard evidence to convict someone. My advice to you is to find this girl and talk to her. Reason with her and get her to stop. If you are truly worried about your girl's mental health, try and get her to see a therapist as you support her. Talk with her as well and encourage her. That is what you can do. What the fuck kind of stupid ass legal advice is this?  [deleted] No. Really, the girl never violated anyone's rights or broke any laws. Maybe a bad thing to do but that's up to you to shut down.
