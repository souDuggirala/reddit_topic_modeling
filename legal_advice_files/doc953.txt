 Before we begin-I know shoplifting is bad. I have learned my lesson. Thanks I recently lost my job and have about $90 to my name. I’ve been using this money to buy medication and food. My iPhone charger broke so I tried to steal two from target, one to replace the broken one and one so I’d never have to do it again if the new one broke. I grabbed two of the fancy target brand ones because those don’t have security things on them. I was caught walking out, was immediately compliant and didn’t run/fight/cause a scene. Gave them all the info they wanted, returned the items, etc. Because the target chargers are stupid expensive though, the price ended up being over the $50 limit and they had to prosecute me. The LP said the whole time that because I was compliant and it wasn’t a lot of stuff, I probably wouldn’t get in much trouble. He said odds are I’ll just have to take a class and it won’t go on my record. I just want to know from a more professional standpoint what the likelihood of that is. I have never been in any trouble, and I intend to comply 1000% with everything.  You need a criminal defense attorney. You might benefit from a plea deal, but you won't get one without an attorney. Don't speak to the police or take any legal advice from them, or anyone but your attorney.  Not a lawyer. This is petty theft which is pretty mild. Get an attorney and you should be good dude. People get no jail time for much more serious offenses. Worst case you have this charge for a year and you get it expunged.
