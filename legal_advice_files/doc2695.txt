 Hey guys, so I get home today to a call from my manager saying that the landlord walked the property and decided he was going to charge everyone who had oil stains on their parking spot $100 to clean it. I have lived here for years and the oil stains were there before I even moved in. He didn’t give us any prior warning that said we had to have the stains cleaned by such date or we were being charged. The notice is dated today and he wants the money today. He said if our cars continue leaving the stains we will be served with eviction notices. Do I have to pay this? Can I be evicted for this? I live in CA in the South Bay and I’ve already called the fair housing commission but I have to wait on a call back.  What are you even talking about? I don't have a lease or a contract. Plus it doesn't matter because I already worked it out. Thanks. That doesn't answer the question.  Oil stains is going to be considered normal use and reasonable wear and tear.  I’m on a month to month.  What does your lease say?
