 No its outside of school How is he doing it ? By contacting the kids while in school ? Did you talk a counselor or the office at school about this ? If it is happening in school property, you need to let them know right away. Is he entering the school to do this ?  You can make an online report to the department of child services in your state. There are investigative teams that will look into this. You can also report it to local law enforcement and they will take care of it.  This dude is buying used underwear from kids in my high school (under 18) and paying them upwards of $200 to spit in his face. Idk what category this falls into but it's definetly illegal. What exactly are you trying to report? CP? Child abuse? Crime stoppers  Done NCMEC.
