 My ex-girlfriend (X) and I had been dating for several years, things got rocky and just before the end I decided to sell her my vehicle on a payment plan. Shit goes down, we break up, she pays me the first payment of $300, and as things deteriorate, she eventually cuts off all communication, and has not made a payment since. It has now been four months since she has taken over ownership of the vehicle via bill of sale/ title transfer, and I have yet to hear from her or receive any further payment. Our families are very intertwined (my parents know hers, my grandparents know hers, etc.) but I’m pretty sure her whole family is in the dark about what is going on. I would like to settle this as civilly as possible due to how connected we are, but at this point I’m not sure what options I have. When transferring the vehicle to her, the title and bill of sale were filled out for $100, and I didn’t think we would need the payment plan in writing as we had agreed to a certain amount per month, and we had been dating for over five years. So as far as documentation goes I think I might be screwed. Since being without the vehicle I have been hard pressed to find rides to/from work, as I was going to use the money from her payments to fund a new vehicle for myself. Is there enough here for a small claims case if it came to that? What would that entail? Court fees? The vehicle? Punitive damages? I’m NAL, so I’m just shooting in the dark but I’m tired of it all and need to settle this dispute to get on with my life. Your only real hope here is that you have emails, texts or something in writing that she was going to pay you more than $100. Otherwise, she owns your car. You could put family pressure on her but that’s unlikely to work. Sorry that it doesn’t look good for you.   $100, and Well, it's probably a bad idea to go to court and admit to commiting tax fraud, and she's already paid you more than 100 bucks... It doesn't look good for you
