 To give an incredibly oversimplified example, imagine that, under oath, a person said "I have not eaten meat in the past week", then later says "I had dinner from Joe's Restaurant last night," and Joe's Restaurant does not have anything non-meat on it's menu. It is provable that one of those two statements must be false. But it may _not_ be provable that either _individual_ statement was false. For instance, you could bring a case that said "he made 2 statements that cannot possibly both be true." But if you can't prove that he actually did eat at Joe's Restaurant, than you can't prove that he had eaten meat when he claimed not to. And if you can't prove that he actually hadn't eaten meat, then you can't prove that he claimed to have eaten at Joe's when he didn't. Would simply the 2 contradictory statements, without knowing which is true, be enough for a conviction?
