 My friends are homeless at the moment. They have expired ID cards. Plus they have been kicked out of most hotels cause of the dogs they have. They have 4 dogs. Keep in mind I'm living at home. I have a few questions. Let's say they decide to rob a bank. They go back to the hotel room which is in my name what happens do I get into trouble to as it's in my name even if I didn't do nothing wrong? This is a hyperthetical situation.  I reasked the question cause it was deleted  About what? R u sure This is y I'm asking this question to see the answers. The animals can be their but unfortunately they didn't pay a deposit.  You will not be responsible for your friends crimes unless you know about the crimes and actively aid them in committing the crimes or evading law enforcement. You will be responsible for their hotel bill, which is likely to be substantial if their dogs mess the place up. You'd be a suspect. You should be more concerned about the damage you are liable for when they leave.
