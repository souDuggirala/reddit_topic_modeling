 Hello r/legaladvice, I missed the open enrollment for my employer's insurance. I'm looking for options and wanted to know if it was legal to get a legal separation and remarried in order to qualify for health insurance. I live in Arizona with my spouse and one kid. I heard that legal separation can take up to 2-4 months. Backstory: I've been working for the same company for the past four years and every year my enrollment would carry over. This year my employer switched health insurance companies and (of course) my enrollment did not carry over. During the month of open enrollment we were understaffed and had a lot of projects and I was working 50-60 hours a week. I missed the memo that we were switching plans and when I saw the reminder that enrollment was ending I didn't think I had to do anything because I never had to re-enroll before. Once I found out I didn't have health insurance I contacted our HR dept but they basically told me it was my fault for not enrolling. I realize that I made a big mistake and fucked over my family. I feel terrible about it. I'm just trying to figure out how I can salvage this situation.
