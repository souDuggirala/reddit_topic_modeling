 So one morning I was enjoying some time by my fireplace at my ex's house when she was out of town (we were still togethet at that point in time) I wasn't there alone, in the house with me were my dog and my ex's cat, (this cat was the dumbest animal I have ever met. So I was playing with the cat and a lazer pointer. I had it pointed at the ceiling of the room, the cat would chase it around looking only obove at the ceiling. I had it pointed towards the the ceiling of the fireplace, and the cat like the idiot it was ran into the fireplace. It caught on fire and was runing around the house screaming as it was on fire. eventually the cat died but not before setting the whole house on fire. Because of this I'm getting sued by my ex, how do I deal with this? /r/madlads Username checks out
