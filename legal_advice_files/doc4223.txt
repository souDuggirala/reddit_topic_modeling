 My [f24] ex boyfriend [m22] is threatening to post private photos of me if I don't reply to him in x amount of time. He sent me an imgur link he compiled of them all. He's already posted a few, along with doxxing myself and my father on an app. What can I do legally to get him to stop? He's been nonstop harassing and borderline stalking me since the breakup. I've just been documenting everything until my appointment with a counselor who specializes in domestic violence cases. This is taking place in Ontario.  [removed] #BoOm RoAsTeD NAL Nobody has said this yet, but you may want to reach out to imgur to see about getting them taken down as well. You'd probably want to get your documentation first, though  ! You didn't. Comment removed.  She can call the non-emergency line for the police in his city and ask to file a report. I would recommend doing this after filing a report locally and getting the local report. You can forward the local report to the other city's department.  Someone in my area just got 7 yrs prison time for doing exactly this. It's not smart. I would take all your documented proof to the police station. The threat alone is harrassment  [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [removed] Take photos of all correspondences of him threatening you and tell him black mail is illegal and that he needs to stop or you are going to the police. Also check to see if there are revenge porn laws in your area. It is against the law if he posts those pictures of you in Canada. http://www.rcinet.ca/en/2015/04/30/canadas-cyberbullying-and-revenge-porn-law-applies-to-adults-too/ Go to the police with all of your documentation ASAP. Under Ontario law, revenge porn is illegal. From section 162.1 of the Criminal Code, :Every person who knowingly publishes, distributes, transmits, sells or makes available an intimate image of a person, knowing that the person depicted did not give their consent to that conduct, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than five years."
