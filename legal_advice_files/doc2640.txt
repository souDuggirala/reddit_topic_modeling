 Hi legal advice! I'm currently a student and I'm interested in donating to a primary candidates campaign fund. Last summer I was an intern at a large well known company, and after I graduate this spring I will return there full time. However I am not currently employed by them. Am I required to disclose them as my employer when I make campaign contributions?  You do if you give more then $200 according to [this](). My understanding is that it is so the FEC can prevent companies from funneling money to campaigns through fake employees.  Why would you need to disclose your employer? Would there be a conflict of interest?
