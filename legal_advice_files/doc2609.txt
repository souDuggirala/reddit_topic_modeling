 To make this brief yesterday I asked whether or not i should report this person who was 20 and dating my sister who at the time was 17. She is 19 now and I assume he is 22. I basically have their conversations where they flirt and are all lovey dovey saying I love you etc. I thought that those screenshots alone would be enough to get him investigated at the very least since what he did seems weird and gross to me. So my question is basically I went through all the messages they sent where it was flirty and romantic, I didnt find anything even close sex talk or pics traded but can I send these convos to the cops and go and arrest him or something? My sister got upset and told me to get a grip and that nothing happened. Location is California. Unless you have some evidence they were actually having sex there is nothing illegal in what you described, and honestly even if you know they were having sex it is very unlikely to go anywhere since your sister is now 19 and presumably isn't going to cooperate with the police.  OK, so you accessed her phone illegally and have no evidence of any foul play? Your answer hasn't changed since yesterday.
