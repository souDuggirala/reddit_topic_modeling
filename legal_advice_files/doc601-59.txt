Can someone dumb it down for me? I've asked my lawyer but they just sent the Texas family code relating to it. I don't need the legal jargon,I just need a better idea of dates that I would be letting him to go his father's. I have primary physical custody.  Ask your attorney. So what is your legal question?

Joint conservators with a standard possession order. I have primary physical custody and right to decide where child lives.  Let's begin.

What did the judge order?
