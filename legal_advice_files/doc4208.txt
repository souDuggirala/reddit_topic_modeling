 My car was parked in a residential area, and the overnight the car in front of it was robbed. My car is so crappy that it was assumed my car had been stolen and left on the street prior to the robbery. The police had it towed and impounded for no reason. When I called the police looking for my car I was told that they had no record of my car being towed. They had no idea where my car was, and I called every towing place in the area looking for my car. None of the towing companies knew where my car was either. Only after I talked to the neighbor, whose car was robbed, did i figure out what happened to my car. Should I go to the towing company immediately and pay to get my car back or is there something else I can do? I don't see why I should have to pay for this or how I'm at fault at all. Thanks for any help! They got you. Thats going to be brutal to do any thing else but pay and get it out.  Thanks! Ok, the police said I will have to have a cop come and have it released when I go there. Thanks for the help. Absolutely you need to go to the towing company and find out the status of your tow, as well as who initiated it. You then need to speak with whomever initiated the tow (almost certainly the police). If they in fact, illegally towed your vehicle under the suspicion that it was involved in the crime, you need to press to have them release it. The best case scenario here is that they release your car at no cost.  Yes. Regardless of whether or not the tow was legitimate, paying to get your car back so it doesn't incur additional storage fees is the correct course of action. After getting your car back, this is going to depend on why your car was towed.
