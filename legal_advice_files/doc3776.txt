 Last night i got a ticket after getting pulled over for making a u-turn at a light with a green light and no interfering traffic anywhere near me (like a car turning right). I did not see the no u-turn sign posted and got pulled over a couple minutes later by the officer who followed me into a parking lot. Now i face a citation of $263 and points on my license (no former citations ever). My alternatives are driving school with a fine and no points, or take it to court (Broward county, Florida, if it matters) I'm considering using ticket clinic, but i haven't heard great things about them. Does anyone here have any pointers? Thanks so much in advance. To me my times not worth it to take off work, drive to the court house and waste my time waiting on a judge. so I just pay my ticket. shit, if the cop had a card swipe I'd pay them directly just so I wouldn't have to go and pay online..Plus it sounded like he missed the sign so why fight it? He fucked up just pay it and move on.  He says that he "didn't see the No U Turn sign posted", not that there wasn't one. Driving school + fine. You don't want points on your license and fighting a ticket like that might not end in your favor.  No U-Turn signs are applicable for more space than just the intersection in question. Theres nothing to contest. Hes gotta pay.  Why not contest it? Seems like if there was no “no uturn” sign and he turned on a green light, he should try to argue it in court Your post has been removed for the following reason(s): Generally Unhelpful or Off-Topic Your comment has been removed as it is generally unhelpful or off-topic.
