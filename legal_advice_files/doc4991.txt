 hello I passed a school bus the other day. 169.444 i live in mn i was pulled over by the police. and mailed a ticket. it has a mandatory court appearance. should I get a lawyer for this. I have no criminal record. looks like fines are 300-500. should I get a lawyer? what should i expect for fines  Never, ever pass a school bus again, sign out or not. It's always a risk and always illegal.  Its odd that you need to appear in court for this so maybe get a lawyer or a public defender depends on where you live as you are only entitled to a public defender if you could face jail time. Its unlikely you would get jail for this if its your first offense and some states you can't even be given jail time for this so its upto you if you want to get a lawyer or not but I would get one. No it cannot get worse with or without a lawyer. You shouldn't be expecting jail time.  okay. so ite very unlikely anything would get worse by getting a lawyer. ie I shouldnt be expecting any jail time?  Possibly find a way out, possibly plea you down, etc.  it was an honest mistake. I saw the 4 ways but didnt see the stop sign out  so what would the lawyer do? plea on my behalf to a lesser crime?  Just curious, why did you decide to pass a school bus? Are you unaware of the danger you present with this kind of recklessness? Yeah you should, but honestly, in most jurisdictions judges take this very seriously. The fines will likely be in the range you stated.
