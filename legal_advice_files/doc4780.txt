 I've never posted anything to reddit before but I've seen this sub a lot and thought it might help. Two years ago, I had to take my ex-husband back to court to reduce his visitation time. We had court mandated mediation first and ended up reaching a new custody agreement there. It was all written up by the mediator, signed by both of us and we have been using it since with no real problems. We both represented ourselves in the matter. I never submitted the agreement to the judge for approval or had the case closed. I didnâ€™t know this needed to be done until today. Yesterday I received a letter from the court saying we have to appear next month to check the status of our case. It says to have a pretrial order prepared for any disputes and to e-file any proposed consent orders or final dispositions prior to the court date. Would the new agreement be a proposed consent order? Should I file that with the court through their system this week? Or do I just bring the mediation paperwork to the court date? Would we need to create a pretrial order if there is nothing left to dispute or contest? If I do need to file the mediation paperwork, do I need to create or complete any forms to file along with it? I found so many guides to filing the initial modification petition and getting it to court, but I am having trouble locating how to correctly submit a successfully mediated agreement to court. This is in Georgia. Sorry for the string of questions, I'm just worried all that stress and work two years ago is going to go out the window because I didn't file it correctly.
