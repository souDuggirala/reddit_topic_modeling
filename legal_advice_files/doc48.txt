 Yesterday I was browsing GoDaddy.com, when I checked to see if my University bought their domain name, only ending in .com instead of .edu, and sure enough they didn't. I ended up buying UNIVERSITY.com for 12 bucks. I have absolutely no plans to start hosting it, or doing anything remotely nefarious, I simply bought it to entertain my friends. My question is could I face legal issues if they find out? I'm pretty sure they would be able to take it if they want, but I also don't really know what will happen. FYI, if they do come after me, I plan on giving it to them. But until then, I just own the name without a website attached I appreciate any advice If you don't make use of the domain, the likely outcome is that you'll end up out your $12.
