 So it's legal here. But my main issue is can my employer still fire me if they decide to drug test me and I come up positive? Can't seem to get a direct answer. And I don't want to ask people at work because it will put a target on my head.  Short answer from here in Colorado is maybe. A business has to be able to insure you - and a lot of insurance companies will declare you uninsurable with a positive test because pot is still against federal law. If you are uninsurable then you canâ€™t work there. It happens here in Colorado - which is already a hard state to hire people in, and a lot of companies have cut or scaled back their drug testing because of it. Yes they can and a lot of companies do  Yes. Marijuana is still illegal in 50 states (federal law). If your company drug tests, they also likely have a policy in place prohibiting drug use. Yes you can.
