 Long story short my dad is living here illegally but is fighting for a VISA again. He has hit and cheated on my mum with her best friend and has been sent to prison multiple times. She wants a divorce. But my 16 year old brother still wants to see him. Will this affect the divorce or his VISA application in any way? Can my dad argue for patial custody over him and my other siblings simply because my brother wants to see him? I just wanna know what will happen if he disgrees to the divorce (which seems likely because he won't even give his address so she can send him the divorce papers) and tbh I don't want him near any of them because he's an abusive asshole. He's adamant he'll win purely because my brother wants him there. "As long as one of you want me then I'm allowed to stay." But yeah. Will my mum's case be dragged out or can the court shut him down quickly? We don't really have the money for a long court case and I just wanna be sure. Any help would be appreciated.
