 So i've tried researching this It seems that in America at least, police reports are considered to be heresy and are often not used as evidence in court. But does the same rule apply in Canada? I know that anything you say to the police before being informed of your right to legal counsel are considered inadmissible as evidence (at least according to wikipedia [\_to\_silence#Canada]()) but police report obviously don't just contain the things you said to them. It also contains what the police witnessed, etc. So im curious how this goes in Canadian court. Thanks  The police reports are included as evidence provided the police officer can speak to them. The report itself is hearsay. But as someone else pointed out, a police officer may testify directly about what they observed and what they heard. The police officer's notes may be legitimately used during the officer's testimony as a memory aid  NAL, but if a police report is submitted as evidence I would think it would be considered hearsay, like in America. However the policeman who made the report could be brought in to testify firsthand as to what was in the report (if its pertinent to the case). That testimony would be legit evidence. Also i remember from a canadian law course i took in uni that hearsay can be accepted as evidence under certain circumstances, im just not sure exactly what those circumstances are, or if the exception would apply to a police report. Someone smarter than me will probably chime in with a better answer, and again I am NAL so dont take this as gospel, but thats my 2 cents
