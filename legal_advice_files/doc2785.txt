 My friend (M26) let a friend of his (F27) stay with him in January. There was no agreement, the friend literally showed up on my friend’s doorstep with a sob story. My friend kinda sucks, but anyway they later asked for half the rent money. The girl agreed and paid it. Again, there were no terms used here but I believe this is the point where this became a contract. Originally, the girl was supposed to be out on the 15th of February (1 month). She didn’t pay her “rent” until maybe two weeks ago though, so in her head she thinks she’s still owed another month. Meanwhile, it is against the lease for my friend to even be subletting or sharing a room. Neither of them know a lot of legal stuff, and I don’t see it escalating to that point, but this IS legal advice. How can he evict her? What kind of lease do they have at this point - month to month? Would returning the money help at all? If it does get to the point of court, will my friend risk his own lease by suing someone else? Thanks
