 I’m 19, my girlfriend is 16, I know it’s weird but we are both religious, I’m especially catholic, the furthest we’ve ever gone is giving hickeys. We both work at a BK I’m a manager she’s a crew member and after work last week we hung out in the parking lot (it was dark) and the car was off so the windows were getting foggy we were there for about an hour before the manger knocked on the back of my window and told us we need to leave, he left immediately after that. The next time I come in I hear that he has been telling people we were having sex in the parking lot, not just the boss but crew members. His allegations would have people think I’m a sexual offender, and are attack on my personal character as people are aware of how religious I am I’m just wondering if I should/can pursue a defamation case Could you sue? Yes, in that the bar to file a lawsuit is purposefully very low and allows all manner of nonsense. Do you have a prayer of proving defamation per se according to NE law here? Almost certainly not.  Well, 16 is under the age of consent of Nebraska, so he technically is accusing you of committing a crime. That being said, I highly doubt it's worth pursuing as a defamation claim. He can truthfully state that he saw the two of you in the backseat of a parked vehicle, late at night, with steamy windows. What people infer from that he cannot help, but the truth of his statement is an absolute defense against defamation. I don't think you have a leg to stand on. What state are you in? In a lot of states this wouldn't constitute a crime, but honestly it's playing with fire if you're dating someone under 18 even if they are in a similar age bracket to you I’m in Nebraska  What state are you in?
