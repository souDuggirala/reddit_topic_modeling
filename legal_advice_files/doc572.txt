 The apartments I live at are saying that if I want any more than one car parked per apartment we have to pay 50$ per vehicle even though there are 2 people on our lease. They are saying parking is first come first serve and if you dont get a spot, you MUST pay for underground parking, or park a block away. They dont have enough parking per resident just per apartment unit. What does the lease say in regards to parking rights?  There's nothing unlawful about this.
