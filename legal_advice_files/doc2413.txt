 I inherited a truck about a year ago from a deceased relative. The truck is now in my name as of a few weeks ago. It is a 2001 ford appraised at around 2,000$. I would like to sell the truck and use the funds I have saved from my part time job ( I’m a college student) to buy a more fuel efficient car. I have wanted to sell it for a while, but my parents (who I no longer live with) are unwilling to even consider letting me. They use the excuse that their insurance will go up. I have never received any benefits from this insurance and they refuse to reveal ANY information on the insurance. I literally don’t even know what company they use. Here’s my question. Is it legal for me to sell the truck and to purchase another vehicle even though the truck is under their insurance? You can sell the truck without their consent as long as ur older than 18 and only ur name is on the registration/title. If you are on the title you can sell it. Also the insurance card with the policy number and insurer should be kept with you when you drive it; your parents are extremely foolish to not give you that info.
