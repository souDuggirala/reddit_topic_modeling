 My friend’s parents live in Illinois. For awhile now, they have been getting toll tickets from Texas. They have never even been to Texas. The car in question, is a truck which they do not nor have never owned. The license plate is the same or similar to theirs but says Truck and a Texas plate while they have an Illinois plate. They’ve tried fixing this and showing they do not own this car nor could have been in Texas but they keep getting tickets.. What are their options? They are not rich, so while they may be able to see a lawyer for something brief, it would be difficult for them to hire a lawyer for an extended period of time.
