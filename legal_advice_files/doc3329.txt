 Hello All, Though I will be writing in the first person, this post is at the request of my parents. So as it says in the title I am having a few issues with a company that doesn't seem too keen on letting me have the requested copy of the contract that I signed a while back. A little background: I signed up for a service that comes to my house each month. This service was not very good and was way too expensive so I decided to cancel. The guy that I contacted in the company was very sad to see me go and so requested that I pay all the missing months that I had "signed in the contract." The contract that I remember signing never had the stipulation that I had to pay for the rest of the months if I canceled early. I thought it was a little weird so I requested a copy of the contract to see what was going on. The kind gentlemen sent me a copy of the contract but lo and behold there seemed to be parts and sentences missing. I thought this was a little weird so I again requested the real copy signed by me. Instead of sending me the real copy he sent me an empty template contract that their company uses. At this point, I realize something fishy is going on with this whole thing and this is when I decided to come here for some advice. Is the best legal recourse a small claims court? Would it be advisable to get a lawyer? I am not originally from the United States so I am not familiar with the legal systems in place for such a situation. Thanks a lot With the blessings of the mod, I have attached a little snit bit of the contract to show the areas that seem to be missing sentences. []()
