 I live in CT USA and have been summoned to jury service 4 times in the past 3 years. I am a bit confused how this process works. I have been summoned to Jury Duty more than anyone I know, and I have never have been required to serve. How is the Jury selection process decided, and why am I summoned at least once a year?  Even better, use "The Big Lie" by D'souza And carry a copy of a Rush Limbaugh book, being careful to raise the hand with the book in it whenever the opportubnity to raise your hand is presented. I don't know how they choose jurors, but you have the right to be excused on your request if you were called for service and were not excused (and reported as required) within the last 3 years. (CGS ยง 51-217a) If it's anything like my country, it's completely random. My mum, who was born and raised in my country, Ireland, and has lived her for most of her life, has never been called for jury duty, not has any of her family. My dad, who is English born and raised (Irish nationality through his mother) on the other had, has been called once. I literally know nobody else that was called for jury duty. I hope to be called at some point, lol. Just wear your Bikers for Trump shirt into the jury pool. You will never get called again.
