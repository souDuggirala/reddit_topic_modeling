 I'm looking into how to become an officiant for a wedding and was filling out the page on their site. It seemed way too easy. I didn't pay a fee, and it didn't tell me anything about the laws in different states, counties, etc. Is it legal anywhere in the US? Thank you! It varies from state to state. California, happily for you, is pretty relaxed; they don't require registration as clergy or anything of that nature, and I know that the Universal Life Church, a similar online-ordination church, has been accepted for many marriages there. As the officiant, you'd be responsible for making sure the marriage is legal and filing the paperwork, but the format of the ceremony is up to the participants. If your paperwork is in order, California is pretty hands-off about the rest. You need to write a statement to attach to the marriage license and file within 10 days of the ceremony. Look up Family Code sections 420-425 for details.
