 Hey all. I'm just gonna give a quick rundown of my situation here and ask a quick question. I bought a car about three weeks ago. It's used, 90k miles. Advertised in good condition with no faults. Within the first week, I've had an exhaust break/possible catalytic converter failure, leaking sunroof, frozen lugs that need torched off and a lack of lift supports for the hood or trunk. All told, the cost for repairs for everything necessary (not including tires and brakes, which I figured I'd need anyway), are over $1,000. The car sale price was $6,700. I'm also worried about the transmission (a gear slipped once, haven't been able to replicate the issue since, but still worried nevertheless). I called the dealership and asked about any recourse, and he recommended a shop that would give a small discount for my relation to the dealership. My question is this, do I have any legal recourse to the sale or anything like that? Is the dealer obligated to cover or partially cover in repairs? Unfortunately, you have no legal recourse. Unless you have an extended warranty, used cars are sold as is.  Not before I bought it, which is something I'm regretting quite heavily. Since then, yeah. I didn't get a grand total for everything wrong, they could only give me rough estimates. Did you have a mechanic check it out?
