 I've talking to someone on dating website and gotten to the point of talking about hooking up. She says she would agree to hook up if i take care of her needs. Her needs consist of paying for nails to get done or paying her phone bill. Is this a form of prostitution? So basically dating... it’s more likely catfishing. less likely she’s looking for a sugar daddy and waiting for you to say it so she won’t have to. it’s not prostitution. It was never really implied. She never stated that in order to hook up I have to pay her phone bill, but instead asked in her words "if I would be down to take care of her needs". If there was an implied quid pro quo where you provide something of value (payment of the phone bill) in exchange for a sexual act then this might considered prostitution, however this will depend on how it’s defined in your jurisdiction. I suppose it may also be possible to argue that she was asking for a gift or a favor and she might just be thanking you.
