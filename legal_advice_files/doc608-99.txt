First of all, my friend is located in North Dakota. She applied to her apartment complex and they told her the pay would go straight to her rent. If she ended up making more than her rent that month, she'd get the extra on a paycheck. 

This just doesn't sound right to me, and I've tried looking it up but I just can't find what I'm looking for. Is this legal?  I would think so. She's still getting paid the full amount. Sure the first month would be tricky making ends meet (hopefully she's in a decent financial situation to start with!), But after that it's no different from any other job.  Coming from a prior property manager this is quite common and actually benefits your friend as the rent will be taken out before she is taxed on that income so essentially she will get paid without being taxed!  So something *like* this is actually pretty common.  A "resident manager" who lives onsite and gets free rent is a great boon to the landlord b/c the landlord is generally not required to pay payroll taxes and, *generally speaking*, your friend would not have to report the rent reduction as income on her taxes.  This situation is a little bit squishier than I would like b/c it could vary month-to-month and both parties would need to be sure that payroll taxes are being paid on any amount that she is paid in excess of her rent. [deleted] It certainly makes sense. It's an extremely odd way to go about things, but you have to admit that it makes more sense than being handed a paycheck, then handing them a check right back. This way, no fuss.
