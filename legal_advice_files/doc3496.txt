 I am the only person on the lease for my two bedroom apartment. I rent out the other room. My roommate and I had an agreement that he would stay until the lease is up in May but he told me on Dec. 9th that he's moving out. When he moved in he gave me $500 deposit. All of this was a verbal agreement. I told him I'm going to keep the deposit. Now he is threatening legal action. Does he have a leg to stand on? Verbal notice doesn't suffice under the LL-T Act. If he moves out, you could consider it an abandonment of the premises and charge him rent against the deposit until a new tenant's lease starts. Keep in mind for an abandonment, you are required to attempt to locate a new tenant. On my lease yes I can sublease a room. And no he did not given me a written notice, just verbally told me.  There are lot of issues heres. I'll try to unpack them. First, have you gotten written consent from your landlord to sublet the unit? If not, the sublease is nullified and you can't enforce it. Second, has your roommate given you a written 30-day notice prior to termination or has he already abandoned the premises? These answers will determine what you can withhold from the deposit (if any). Third, note that withholding money from the security deposit is risky. If you deduct too much or fail to provide proper notice, the tenant can sue you for three times the security deposit plus his attorney's fees. I would encourage you read over the [South Carolina Landlord Tenant Act]() for all the requirements.
