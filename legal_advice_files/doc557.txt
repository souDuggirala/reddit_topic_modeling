 I work for a structural engineering firm that expects pretty much all young engineers to work more than 40 hours a week. We are all non-exempt, so we get paid for every hour worked. However, our overtime is paid the same amount as our normal hourly wage (so only 1.0x). Just about every online source I can find states overtime for non-exempt employees are paid 1.5x, which is what I hear at similar positions in other firms. Are we the employees of this company getting our wages robbed or is it actually legal to pay non-exempt employees below 1.5x for overtime?  Thanks for that correction.  Filing a [wage claim]() with the Washington DoL requires providing your contact information. Unlike most of the others, they [do share your name](). The federal DoL keeps complaints [anonymous](), so you can file through them instead. They will only enforce federal law though (FLSA), so if there's other potential violations of state law, that may go unnoticed  Fair Labor Standards Act \- They must pay you 1.5 for over 40 hours in a work week. Some employers have thought that it was in a pay period- Example: Bi weekly pay- one week you work 45 hours and the next week you work 25 and they fall in the same pay period so they do not pay overtime. This is NOT allowed. By law you should be paid 65 hours regular and 5 hours overtime for that pay period. Legally they owe you back pay for the OT.  Our overtime is automatically 1.0x Comp Time, but we can cash out comp time any time. Is there a way for me to report this anonymously? Comp time is not allowed in lieu of overtime payment for private companies If you're non-exempt, you should be entitled to either 1.5x pay OR 1.5x PTO for hours worked over 40.  We need your location. In the US, you would be owed 1.5x pay for overtime if you were non-exempt
