 Hi. I’ve got a judgment against me, I’ve periodically contacted the creditor, a former landlord, several times, offering payment. They refuse to call or text back, there’s no other phone number I can reach them at, and I even called their lawyer and.... he told me to call the landlord to pay it off. WTF? Why don’t they want my money? Is there a long con I’m unaware of? I have contacted legal counsel for advice and am awaiting a reply. Figured I’d ask if anyone else has ever had this happen? I’ve gotten no letters, no calls, no texts, no emails asking for the money, it’s not on my credit report, and it hasn’t, to my knowledge, gone to any collections agencies either. So what the hell? OP should also make sure the account that money is stored in has the highest possible interest return, without being an investment that could lose the money. No cryptocurrency investments please... Any number of reasons, social anxiety, laziness, death, pending divorce etc. Document your attempts to pay. Put the money in a separate savings account. Wait. Maybe they'll never make contact. If they fail to do so within the statute of limitations pull the money back out and buy something nice. You didn't give a location but the statute of limitations on judgements can be quite long like 10 years with the option to refresh for another 10 years.
