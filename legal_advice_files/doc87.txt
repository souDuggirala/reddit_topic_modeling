 I rent in Netehrlands a fully furnished studio, i.e. the studio comes with all equipment for living. I have lived here for a few years and I recently notice the matress is sagging. It was not so annoying at the beginning but it grew worst over time and I eventually informed the rent agency that I want it fixed. They say they can replace it, but I need to pay for the new matress, which is a few hundred euros. However, my understaning was that the matress is part of the "furnitre" and part of my monly rent is to cover the depreciation, especialy considering that the matress has already served me alone for a few years, not to mention its serving time for previous tenants. And then I looked up my rent contract and found the following article: For each payment period of month: \-the rent of the property amounts to : € xxx \-... \-.. \-the advance on the compensation for "Other supplies and services" to be provided by or on behalf of the Landlord for the Tenant as referred to under 6m inluding VAT.:: €yyy So the total rent is xxx+yyy plus a bunch of other costs. And then, in the "Other supplies and services" category, the top of the list is: \- depreciation of upholsetering and furniture present according to teh handover report I want to ask whether I have a strong case to ask the rent agency to replace the matress without me paying for me. And if the rent agency still refuses to do so, which party should I escolate this to? Sounds like you’ve already paid for it under all these other costs you’re paying, and it sounds like fair wear tear of an item used daily so I definitely agree it is unreasonable to ask you to pay for this yourself.
