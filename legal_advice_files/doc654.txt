 My wife is an artist and we are working on a project to paint a famous person. The subject of the painting is public official. My wife has 2 main concerns: 1: Can you sell a painting of someone's likeness without their permission? Is it different for famous/public persons? 2. If the photo you are using as a reference to paint from was found online, do you need the photographs permission to paint from that photo? We are in North Carolina, United States. Thanks for any help! If the original is owned by Getty, they will sue you if they find it. They may not win, but is it worth the $$ to fight? Hmm, we'll have to keep that in mind But was that a painting or was it a digitally edited image? A painting is its own work that has no part of the original in it as it starts with a blank canvas but a photoshopped image uses the original directly. Good point though! Actually, this is not as clear-cut as you imply. In 2011, the AP settled with the Obama "Hope" artist after a protracted legal fight. The work must be significantly transformative to avoid any legal disputes. Simply painting a portrait from a photo (for example, a 'Warhol-esque' version of the same pose) would not be transformative enough. It is truly a gray area - especially if the photo in question is owned by Getty or a wire service.  Thanks! I had hoped as much. I'm not sure where my wife gets her information but she has always been worried about these kinds of things. Yes you can sell the painting. Unless her painting is completely photorealistic (like indistinguishable) it is covered by its own copyright. I believe it would be if it were photorealistic too but it might be more of a headache to prove.
