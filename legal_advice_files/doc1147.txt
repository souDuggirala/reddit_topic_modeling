 I hope this is the right thread to post in, but my parked car was hit on my university’s campus and the person who hit my car thankfully admitted it and called the campus police. I was told by the officer that I am not at fault (I live in FL for reference). I haven’t been in this situation before, and I’m unsure as to whether I should be contacting (A) my insurance company or (B) the insurance company of person who hit me or (C) both. Please advise me on the wisest solution, I don’t want my insurance to be affected in any way because of this.  I always suggest to clients to first file with the opposing insurance. If they are cooperative it should go fairly quickly but if they aren't then you can always fall back on filing on your own policy. I say use your insurance only when needed as a backup because 1. You'll be out you're deductible until when or even if they get it back thru subro which can take weeks or months and 2. Even with a NAF accident, you can still see a rise in premiums because of it in states that allow it.  Contact your insurance company with the report number from campus police, this is why you pay them. Your insurance. And get the police report ASAP. Let your insurance take care of the rest.
