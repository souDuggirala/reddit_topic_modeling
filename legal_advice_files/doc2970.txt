 He was on a visa at the time and is back in Morocco now. This happened 8 years ago. Thank you First, I want to say that I am sorry that this happened to you and canâ€™t imagine your pain and the difficulties faced. Generally speaking, the court that has jurisdiction is based on where a crime is alleged to have occurred. This means that you would need to contact law enforcement in the county or city in North Carolina where it happened. This would be a tough issue to prosecute because of the difficulty in conducting interviews and investigation and then extraditing and trying the case.  Realistically it's unlikely anything will happen at this point, but the U.S. would be your starting point.
