 Minimal family bullshit. My mother was at the point where we needed to get her a power of attorney. I was the principal advocate. Because of her condition, she gets confused and goes up and down emotionally. Currently she at least thinks she removed me as power of attorney, but she's not really sure. I do still have the paperwork for the original power of attorney, but I've had no indication or paperwork that says that it was revoked.I have made a call to the attorney that drew up the paperwork, but I have not heard back from them. Would there be a telltale sign or letter stating that I was removed? Yes, it is a durable power of attorney. I am the patient advocate, and my sister-in-law is the successor patient advocate. she actually thinks she tried to add a third person as a successor, but I've never seen any paperwork for that and I don't think it's true. That was my understanding as well. I believe she got confused, and she actually just mixed up with the primary contact for the hospital, rather than power of attorney paperwork. Thank you. Was this a durable power of attorney? And if so, is she in fact competent to revoke it? And if it's not, her competence again comes into play because if she is no longer competent the POA lapses. She must provide written documentation saying the power of attorney is revoked in order for it to be legally revoked. Oral statements would not be legally sufficient.
