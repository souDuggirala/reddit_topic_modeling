 I entered the person’s property with their permission but have reason to believe they are keeping it elsewhere for now, unfortunately I am lacking in proof, only a strong suspicion. I made a police report about the situation today, would law enforcement have any means of pursuing a case of this nature?  I figured, I suspect them based on seeing them carrying an animal carrier and they are acting defensive. it’s not much.  What makes you believe they have it? Generally a hunch is not enough for police to get warrants for searches.
