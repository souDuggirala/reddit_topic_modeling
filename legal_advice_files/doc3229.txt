 We live in Ohio, he was going to Iowa with his family to visit his side of the family for Christmas and got arrested in Iowa for a warrant for his arrest. My question is there anything he can do or prepare for ? He didn’t have a license a few years ago and the only way he could get them was paying his fines from 14 years ago and he did that and received his license in Ohio and thought that was the end of that. He got married in Iowa 2 years ago finished school and has a great job, I don’t know if that helps in any way ? So what I don’t understand is how this benefits anyone to put someone in jail for 30-60 days after paying fines and getting his shit together ? Any and all advice is welcome please help he is gonna be in jail till mid February :( [removed] Your post has been removed for the following reason(s): Generally Unhelpful or Off-Topic Your comment has been removed as it is generally unhelpful or off-topic.
