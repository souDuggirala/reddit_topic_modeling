  So let me get everything coverd. We will start with having 2 twins around 5 months old being sick. They had a flu and Rota virus. After taking them to hospital mother went home to her daughter because little girl has epilepsy. Some time passes and she comes for a visit to to hospital. She found her babies completly dirty without even clean dipers. Babies were crying , dirty and were having some other problems. Hospital claims everything is right but mother insists on them getting sued. Is this what she is supposed to do or? I am sorry for spelling because I am not comimg from an English speaking country Please note that everything I said was found online with pictures as a proof and also it was published by a couple of news agencies that are amongst the top in my country  She should speak to an attorney in your area to get a better idea of her options
