 I moved out of my rental house when I purchased my first home outside Portland, OR in October. The city of Portland bills water every 3 months, with this period covering Sep to Dec. Because the bill just came out, my landlord reached out asking me to cover the period until I moved out. I’m disinclined to do so for a couple reasons. We moved in to the rental at the end of October 2017. The billing cycle was the same, so we ended up paying the whole water bill, including the two months before we moved in. At the time, I raised this with the landlord and he said we’d discuss splitting the payment “later.” I would consider this “later.” What recourse do I have. Alternatively, what recourse does he have to get me to pay when I no longer have a legal obligation to him. I feel like this is his failure as a landlord to foresee this and take it out of my deposit (which he returned soon after moving out.) Thanks! Tell him he owes you money for you paying before you moved in, and that his amount owed will cover the water bill since you've moved out.
