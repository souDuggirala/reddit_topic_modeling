 My fiancé is potentially getting a job out of the state. After we’re married I’d go with him. This would involve having to break my lease. I don’t want a hit on my credit score so I went to the leasing office to see if I could get someone to take over my lease. They told me they don’t allow that but I have two other options. 1) Give 30 days notice and upon move out pay 2 times the rent and any cleaning fees necessary. 2) Give 60 days notice and keep paying the rent until a new tenant moves in or the lease ends. The leasing agent told me that neither option would affect my credit negatively. I’m suspicious of that because I’ve never heard of that before. Is that possible? "Breaking the lease" by just up and absconding in the middle of the night and skipping out on your rent obligations has the potential to affect your (and your cosigner's/guarantor's) credit. "Breaking the lease" by working with the landlord and within the parameters of whatever your lease says about early termination does not. Got it, thank you! Ahh I see. This is my first apartment and I had heard that breaking the lease could be a hit but I wasn’t sure. Plus I had to have a co-signer so I didn’t want his credit to be affected either. I appreciate the help. Your credit report is only adversely affected by a debt if you don't pay it as agreed. The leasing agent is right. What you are thinking about is getting evicted.
