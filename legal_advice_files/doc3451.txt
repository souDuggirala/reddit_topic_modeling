 Here’s a screenshot of the email they sent me. I believe this means they have to sent me a lease termination regardless of whether or not they get a new tenant but I don’t know much about the law. I’ve already hired movers for next month under the assumption I should get out of my lease for February. This is in Ann Arbor, Michigan, US  That’s what I was afraid of. Hopefully those people don’t back out :/ Thanks for the timely response I understood what you meant. The answer is still the same. They don't have to let you terminate/send over lease termination forms before they have another tenant sign. ...They also didn't have to let you terminate ever at all; since allowing you to terminate was a kindness, you might consider not getting hung up on this.  What I mean is them telling me they were going to send over the lease termination without mentioning a lease being signed. Like they said they’d send the lease termination over when their other guy gets back into the office The apartment complex wants to wait to terminate your lease until they're sure someone else taking your spot doesn't back out at the last minute. That's legal. No. They don't have to let you terminate your lease before your replacement signs. What sense would that make? What if the replacement doesn't end up signing, an eventuality you're aware could occur given your mention of having already scheduled the movers...?
