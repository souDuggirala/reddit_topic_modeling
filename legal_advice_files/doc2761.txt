 Complete bystander here, just asking around out of curiosity. Recently members of my team was pulled aside by our boss for a conversation about "creating a hostile work environment". Apparently someone in the team felt they are consistently shunned in the office and complained to our boss. The boss have a dialog with the party in question trying to address this work dynamic. The boss also warned that it could create ground for lawsuit and all our text message on the company server can be used as evidence. Playing nice and work together. Now, as far as I know, that member was treated that way mostly from their work ethic, and that it has nothing related to anything cover under Title VI. Honestly I think the boss was trying to be a peacemaker, and that person may not even think of bringing up lawsuit. Of course, now that the problem was brought up this way, I doubt it will get resolve, if not worsen. We are in California. Does that person really have ground for lawsuit? What can be the repercussions from this if lawyers are involved?  Lawsuits, terminations, chaos in the streets, cats and dogs living together. No, not from the sounds of it. Your boss was just, as you said, trying to be a peacemaker.
