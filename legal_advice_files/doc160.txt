 I got into a car accident in Feb of this year (California), car pool lane was flooded and hydroplaned into the divider. No one else was involved and i was at fault. After a month of back and forth, the car was written off as a total loss and everything was finally "settled", check was supposed to mail to my bank (car was being financed). I've called them about 40 times about this and i get the run around every time, and i'm just not sure what to do anymore. The amount they settled on was supposed to cover what i have left on the car but i cant keep making 2 car payments, and interest is slowly going up on it. Is there anything i can do about this? Yes. File a complaint with the California department of insurance and let your insurance company know. Gets taken care of pretty quickly usually after that.
