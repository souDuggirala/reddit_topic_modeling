 Hi all, New around here. I apologize if I am breaking any rules and if this may not be the right location. I am helping out a fine diner in my area with some business development and they approached me with a scenario I was not able to advise on. Without getting into too much detail they have created a product so unique and desired that most people that show up are starting to come just for this product. They are considering starting to mass produce and sell it as just a stand alone product on the side while keeping the business going. Reminiscent of a hometown success story that started as a mexican restaurant and started selling a unique salsa that was bought out by a large corporation for millions. They are asking me about whether they need to trademark or patent their food product or anything that may come along with a rise in popularity? Can anyone here that has experience in the food industry advise? Tl ; dr- Restaurant I am working with is becoming locally famous because of a food item they created. Worried about someone stealing it and moving forward from here. Is there such a thing as trademarks/ patents for food? Thank you to anyone that takes the time to read this and respond.  Thats exactly what I was trying to find out. Thanks for your input.  Recipes generally cannot be protected.
