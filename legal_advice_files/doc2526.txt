 Hey, yâ€™all. I just joined this reddit to get some advice on something that happened not even a few hours ago. My mom and I were on our way into our apartment complex, when she reached the landing of the concrete stairs out front and slipped. She hit her head on said stair, and we are now in the hospital getting her treated. Now, this particular apartment complex is notorious for never shoveling or salting their walkways or outdoor stairs. Not even in the parking lot. Is their any action we could take against said apartment management? Please help!
