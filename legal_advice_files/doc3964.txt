 No- that makes no sense. A '5 Day Notice to Pay or Quit' means that the tenant either needs to pay their back-due rent or vacate the unit within five days. That being said- I've seen leases that specifically state rent needs to be paid in cash or cashier's check if it's late in getting to the landlord. If that's in your lease- then your landlord would be fine to refuse a personal check for late rent.
