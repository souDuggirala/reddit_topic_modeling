 Just to give a brief rundown, I had been working for this company for about 3 years. In my time there I took some college courses, because they offered tuition reimbursement. When taking the classes, you have to stay with the company for a certain amount of time after that. I left before that time was up due to sexual harassment from my manager and the upper management making it a hostile work environment. I tried calling hr and they came to do an investigation. When I spoke with hr I informed them that I felt uncomfortable staying in that store, but the hr lady told me that they don't move the problems they fix them. The sexual remarks seemed to stop after that, but he retaliated after by coming down even harder about goals and gave my sales to other associates. I decided I couldn't tolerate the environment I was in and left. I'm now being charged for those classes and am wondering the best course of action. What type of lawyer should I contact? Do I even have a solid case, and how would I go about taking care of this? Any advice would be much appreciated.  You've got nothing to lose by contacting a couplw of labor lawyers for a free consultation, but if you had to stay a certain amount of time and you didn't, it'll be a very uphill battle. Also, your legal fees may cost more than the cost of the classes.
