 I turn 16 in two days. I live with my mom, but we don’t get along well so I’m thinking of moving out. I get yelled at for everything I do and I just want to get out of my mom’s hair for the sake of the two of us. The rest of my immediate family also does not get along well with me so I can’t depend on them for help. My question is if it’s possible to move out at 16 and if there’s any sort of support I can get from the government or some child service. It's not the government's job to support you because you want to move out at 16. If you don't get along with your mom and the rest of your family, it might be time to evaluate why and what you are doing to contribute to the problem. Sure! Is your mom going to approve you to move out? If so, can you sufficiently support yourself?
