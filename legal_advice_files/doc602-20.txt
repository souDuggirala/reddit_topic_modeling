I've accumulated a small mountain of debt over the past year and don't know how I'll ever pay it off. 

I don't have any real assets (owe more than book value on cars and don't own any property).

I make between $3,000 and $4,000 per month (commission-based position).

I owe $13k in credit card debt and $10k in unsecured personal loans.

I've made all of the minimum payments on time, but I can't afford to pay more than that.

So.. should I file for bankruptcy, or should I pursue other options to settle the debt?

Also, I haven't kept all of my pay-stubs from the last six months. How can I obtain those if I do file?

**tl;dr**: Racked up a mountain of debt while ill, not sure how I'm ever going to pay it off. You can talk to a bankruptcy attorney, but there are plenty of other options out there for you, including [Credit Counseling](https://www.consumercredit.com/) that can help you have this paid off in 5 years. &gt; I've made all of the minimum payments on time, but I can't afford to pay more than that.

I suspect that bankruptcy would only be a temporary solution because it sounds like you are living beyond your means.

Maybe pop over to /r/personalfinance for some advice on how to reduce your expenses first. Not a legal question, try r/personalfinance. If all you've done so far is add up your debt and pay the minimum balance your need to be thinking through things more before just going straight to bankruptcy. [deleted] 23k isn't a mountain.
