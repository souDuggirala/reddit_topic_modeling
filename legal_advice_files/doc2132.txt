 My brother's boss keeps asking him to write a company check to another employees' shell company. My brother suspects they are doing it to avoid taxes, so he refused because he is uncomfortable with it. The boss keeps insisting that he do it, even threatening to fire him for refusing. My question is, can my brother be fired for refusing to do something he's not comfortable with? Also, should my brother report his suspicion to someone? Thank you in advanced!  Thank you for the response, I really appreciate it. Unfortunately, there is nobody to talk to in the company about it, only about 10-15 employees. The boss is the only owner. Would there be an outside hotline for these kinds of things or something he can do to protect himself?  Is there somewhere else in the company where he can escalate this? A whistleblower hotline? HR Department? It is illegal for the employer to retaliate against a good-faith whistleblower, i.e. someone who in honestly believes something is being done that is wrong and reports it. Or is the "boss" the only owner of the company? My brother asked my boss why since the other employee already gets a paycheck. The boss just said what he is doing is legal, but in a "gray area" and told my brother not to tell anyone. So from my brother's point of view, it's really fishy and he's scared to do it.  Yes he can be fired for not performing his duties as assigned. What is wrong with writing a company check to a subcontractor?
