 I drive for a company that delivers campers. I have driven 2000 miles over the last 4 days and on the last day a bird hit my trailer damaging it. Company says it is no longer deliverable. So I need to bring it back for repairs. Company will not pay me for the miles already driven nor the miles on the way back. Is this legal? I have Michigan Ohio because I live in Michigan and work for a company in Ohio. Not sure which place counts or any. It says I will only be paid if the unit is undamaged or the company States it can be delivered.  What kind of contract did you sign with them? I would hate for you to be out of money, but if your contract only pays for successful delivery and doesn't have any exceptions for damage to the cargo en route, you might be :(. There are various kinds of insurance that owner operators can buy for cargo damage, though I can't tell if they cover mileage or just cargo value. I am a 1099 worker. My own truck. I am starting to believe I am just SOL.  IANAL, nor is this an issue I'm very familiar with, but this could be illegal depending on the nature of your employment. Some questions that might be relevant: Are you exclusively employed by this company? Do you work for them on a full-time basis or as a contractor? Was this delivery an individual contract? Oh, and do you own your own truck? I think that when you're talking about interstate transportation, it is neither MI or OH laws that apply, but federal. Most such laws are aimed at regulating long-haul truckers, but I expect you would be covered by some of them. So if nothing else you could start here: []() .. and see if they can provide any pointers.  No I don't have a union.  No it is not legal. Do you have a union?
