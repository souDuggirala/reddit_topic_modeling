 Ok so I dont know where to go from here so I need some help. I bought a car from a car dealership about 3 months ago and they still havent give me my stickers or registration or anything for that matter! I went to the DMV and they told me that the Dealership still has the car under their name and there has been no paperwork filed from the sale. They also said to contact the dealership. Well here I am and I cant reach the dealership I send emails leave voicemails and everything and I get no reply. I dont even know what kind of lawyer I should look for or would a lawyer even help in my situation? Can someone please help me out here because my temporary registration is already expired and I cant drive the car anymore. Also I know I'll get asked but this is in California and I cant drive to the dealership because the dealership is 500 miles away from me. I actually flew to fremont to get this car. Therefore cant just go in person. No the car wasnt overly expensive or anything it's just a rare find but not expensive. It's a small time dealership but a dealership none the less. What do I do? What does the paperwork you signed when you bought the car say?
