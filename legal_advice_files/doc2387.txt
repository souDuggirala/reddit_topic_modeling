 My father has been abusive since I can remember but never physically but he threatens my mom with it a lot. And she wants him to leave but every time they talk about divorce he says she’s the one who has to leave, this includes myself and my siblings as well. I think both of their names are on the house. What can my mom legally do? I would like to note that we are very poor as my moms job just shut down and my dad doesn’t work due to medical issues. So we can’t afford any type of legal help, my mom is barely scraping by and has 0 spending money or savings. What’s the best way to have him leave without him getting violent? Can the police do anything or does he have to be physically abusive for them to do anything? Any advice would be helpful, thank you. karen took the fucking kids  You can call the police over him verbally threatening to physically hurt someone or posturing like he's going to punch someone.  State?
