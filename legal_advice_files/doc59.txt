 Basically my mother in law was involved in a domestic violence case which the civic court ruled in her favor, essentially granting her a TPO against her ex-partner, where he can no longer stay in the same house. I believe he must also pay in childsupport. One thing against my MIL was that she waited a week before submitting a police report, but the judge still ruled in her favor given that Their son who is a minor was one of the witnesses and there were photos and prior instances submitted as evidence. Ex-partner has a history of minor violence misdemeanors as he suffers from PTSD However now she is getting counter-sued for who knows what. What are our recourses, what should we be preparing for? She doesn't really have a lawyer to turn to, we were granted one via a program organization in our state whilst she filed the TPO. Thanks. We just want it all to be over with so we can move forward.
