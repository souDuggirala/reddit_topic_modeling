 To be fully transparent, I am looking to see if I can make a quick buck (or some other self serving outcome). I am currently vacationing in Orlando, FL. While visiting 2 public parks, I noticed they were playing Christmas music on loudspeakers. The songs were clearly religious in nature, wishing people a merry Christmas and celebrating the birthday of jesus. Does this not violate separation of church and state? As a non Christian, I am truly offended and would like either financial compensation or force them to play a religious song of my choice. Do I have a case? Any Florida lawyers willing to take up my case can pm me.
