 Can some one Explain what is prohibited communication as it pertains to a protective order .. Stating " The protected persons may recorde any prohibited communication made by the restrain persons." What does this mean exactly. Text.. Phone calls.. In person conversations ?  The meaning of "any" is pretty broad. I'm assuming you're the restrained person, let's say some guy named Tony is the protected one. If there's any way for you to communicate with Tony whatsoever, it's not allowed period, shut up, don't do it. If you do it anyway, Tony's allowed to record your communication by any means available to him: Audio, video, writing, hologram, psychic imprint, vibrations in wet clay, whatever.  Are those forms of communication prohibited? If they are prohibited, then the protected person can record them.
