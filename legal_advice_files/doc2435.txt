 So I had a couch surfer about a ago and instead of paying me rent he left me a 2013 Nissan Sentra. There is no title or registration. I’m not even sure if the car is paid off. I don’t want to just have the car impounded bc I feel I can make a decent amount of money on the car. Who do I need to call to see if the car is paid off and to get the title from? He said he got the car from his mom but besides that all I know is it is registered in Maryland and I live in Tennessee. I know the car isn’t stolen his mother bought it for him in Maryland. He recently moved back in with her in Florida and neither one has called or asked about the car once.  Basically the state would auction it and you can request up to 60 days of storage fees be paid to yourself from the proceeds of the sales. You wouldn't be able to just take the car, from what I see. You can also look up the VIN and see if there is still a lien on the title, that would tell you if there is a loan or not.  And thank you for taking the time to reply to this!  So I’m not that great at interpreting what it says, there is a way for me to either get ownership of the car or pay the rest of the loan off if I fill out the form and follow the steps?  No. You would need to report it and the state would take the car. Or, assuming you want to keep or sell the car you need the title signed over to you.  Doesn’t it fall under an abandoned vehicle? And since it’s been on my property a year doesn’t that legally make it mine?  They would need to sign the title over to you. You can not just assume ownership.
