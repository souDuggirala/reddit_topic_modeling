 A friend of mine brought the vehicle in to a vehicle repair shop. he was told the problems and how much and my friend authorized it without my consent and I did not know that until I was handed the bill. The shop owner now has the title of my car because I could not pay for the work done. There is now a lien and Iâ€™m not able to sell this car. what are my rights? You can sue your friend for the price of the repair.
