 I have been a hobbyist electronics makers for a few years now and I with the help of a friend have been developing a new off the shelf electronics device to fill a niche that we feel is not currently being well served. After many many months of going back and forth with each other and developing specifications and such we think we might almost have a product ready to go to market. Now the part we are both worried about is how much we need to worry about liability if we decide to sell this device. This device in simple terms will measure how high you are whenever falling and will allow user configurable settings on whenever to alert you to pull a sky diving parachute. I have looked greatly into the laws regarding the devices themselves and there is no certification agency for hobby (not for airplane) skydiving that I can find nor that I can find listed for any company that currently sells them. How worried would I need to be selling these devices as an individual and what protections would setting up an LLC or whatever I need actually get me? Is there anything else I need to worry about?  I hope you first spent money on a market analysis before spending money on a prototype. There canâ€™t be that many people who would by this. Plus you are swimming very deep into the product liability pool. Your product fails and someone literally dies a few seconds later.  Talk to one who does insurance defense. Gonna be honest, I am not entirely sure what lawyer I should even consult. Considering this device is meant to be used while plummeting toward the Earth at terminal velocity, you need a lawyer for this. Not a bunch of internet strangers.
