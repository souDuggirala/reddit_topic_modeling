 North Carolina. I'm a functioning alcoholic and need help. I've located an in-patient treatment facility near me that has a good reputation and I think I would do well there. I qualify for FMLA and have plenty of paid time off. I need to go there for at least 30 and maybe up to 60 days. The cost of the treatment is not a issue for me, but my reputation is. Two very close friends have already told me "They already know" when I express my concern for my anybody at my employer finding out I have a drinking problem. Is there anything I can do to make sure \\nobody\\ at my employer, even HR, knows the exact reason I am taking FMLA protected leave? If it helps, if you're to the point of needing rehab, there's no way people don't know you have an issue. Getting help is a great thing, and your reputation won't take a hit with people knowing. Like the other poster said, you're unlikely to be able to hide the reason from your employer if you're applying for leave. They have a right to know why you're asking, and it's necessary to determine if you're granted it or not.  Your employer is not entitled to know your diagnosis, but they are entitled to enough information to determine if your condition is FMLA eligible. That may include a medical cerfifiate from a doctor.
