 I currently live in California but I am in the process of moving to the great state of Texas. When I move, my family and I will be relying on a moving company to get our stuff from point A to point B, including the transportation of my personal vehicle. The registration for that vehicle is due by the end of January but we are going to out of here no later than the middle of March. Since I would only be living here for another month, would it not be prudent to forego California’s exorbitant registration fees for the year and save the money? Or are there Texas laws that would hinder this? A little background, leaving the vehicle unregistered wouldn’t risk a moving violation because I almost never drive it as it is. I drive a company vehicle for work and I work full time. I don’t usually go anywhere on the weekends (no social life) and when I do go out I’m keeping my father company.  I wasn’t going to let the insurance lapse because I need it for other reasons but I hadn’t even considered there might be a difference between a stored vehicle and a driving vehicle to the insurance company.  If you have a private off street place you can store an unregistered car you can let the registration lapse and register it in Texas when you have a home address to do so with. You'll need to change your insurance for a stored vehicle. I wouldn't just let it lapse because if a tree falls on it or someone steals it you'd be screwed.
