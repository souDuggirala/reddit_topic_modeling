 21 F. Texas So my boyfriend (ex now) and I were dating for a few months. He just sent me nude photos of myself (that I didn’t know he took) and threatened to send them to my father. My father did not know I was dating anyone and would not have approved. He also sent me his Venmo name (idk if jokingly). I am worried. Is there any legal action I can take? TIA tl;dr: ex threatening to release private photos  You should still make the report. Your statement is testimony. You should block him on snap and not accept messages from new accounts to make sure he can't try to continue manipulating you.  Your statement to the police is proof.  He might ignore you if you go to him, he might not. But this is clearly blackmail. If someone contacts you and threatens to blackmail you then you have 3 options 1) call the police and let them investigate as blackmail is illegal. The blackmailer may release the blackmail information 2) block and ignore the person. The blackmailer may release the blackmail information 3) do what the person is blackmailing you to do and become their bitch for life. Once you comply with blackmail you have told them that they have something valuable on them. Silence cannot be purchased, only rented, they will come back at some later point in time. I don’t know what option I would pick if I were in your spot but I know which one I wouldn’t. He sent me the pics and Venmo on Snapchat so I have no proof. Is there still something I can do?  Call the police. Both revenge porn and extortion are illegal in Texas.  Thank you. If I do not want to go to the police can I just confront him and tell him to stop or I will go to the police?  Call the police. What he is doing is extortion, and it's a serious crime.
