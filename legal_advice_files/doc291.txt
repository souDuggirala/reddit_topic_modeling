 Hi there, this is my first time posting here, so I'm not quite sure if this is okay. Now for the story: I have some damage in my neck and to avoid surgery, and get off of pain meds, a Spinal Cord Stimulator implant is something I pursued. The trial went well so we went ahead and scheduled the surgery. Prior to being taken into the OR, the surgical techs and the doctor discussed with me the placement of the device. He asked me where I wore my pants and where my belt would sit, and after I showed him, I could feel him mark the location just above my the area. Keep in mind I'm fairly tall, but with an unusually long torso, I had mentioned that I hoped it would reach. (The placement was going to be in my lower back with the electrodes running up into my C-Spine area) After I woke up from the surgery, the doctor told me that the leads didn't in fact reach, so he had to remove the device and reposition it about 4 inches higher. Now I have an extra (unnecessary) scar which has to heal. I talked with a surgery liason and he even mentioned that measurements should have been taken beforehand, but he informed me that I need to talk with the doctor about it. Was this okay? Should I be upset, or even try to pursue some legal action to help pay for the surgery? I'm waiting to hear back from the doctor right now. Thank you! I would also post in r/medicine to see if someone more familiar with SCS can speak on this. I think because the leads did not reach during surgery, he had the right to reposition it which resulted in another scar. Medical malpractice is a difficult field to work in. I'd suggest calling some medical malpractice attorneys. Most will offer free consulting for the first conversation and will work on contingency / only charge if they win and will take the money out of your compensation).
