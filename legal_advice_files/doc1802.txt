 So essentially, our principal of 5 years was basically forced to resign out of absolutely nowhere. One of the nicest guys you'll ever meet and the board (5 members) voted and supposedly gave him an ultimatum: resign or be fired. The board held a meeting in which they explained that they will not release information regarding his "resignation" and that it isn't their responsibility to do so. No one and I mean no one knows but them. Rumors are flying and it's just sad all around. I just don't know what to do. Should I demand it be released by the Freedom of information Act? Will this do anything? I feel like we're just trapped in a bubble right now. Personnel information is confidential and will never be disclosed. There is actually legal liability if they make public or private statements as to why the termination/resignation happened. Source: 4 year public school board member, 1 year President.  Personnel actions are protected from release by the Federal Freedom of Information Act and all state Sunshine laws. You will not get the info unless the principal gives it to you. The fact that the principal has not told you all what happens speaks volumes as to the fact that this was probably more justified than you believe. Why do you feel you are privy to this information? If you want to know, ask the former employee directly. The school board isn’t required to share details of other people’s employment with you or other employees. You cannot demand anything and they don't have to tell you why he was terminated.
