 I'll try to keep the background brief. My SO lives with her dad in a rental home. He's not there very often because he's a long distance trucker (he's there about a week out of every month). They're being evicted and apparently there's about $5k worth of back rent. Her dad's girlfriend has been liaison with the landlord since her dad's out of town and my SO has never met the landlord. Anyway, they're saying my SO is responsible for the back rent and may have to go to court over it. I'm wondering about the legality of this since 1. She's not on the lease, and 2. She never agreed with the landlord, on paper or in person, that she would be an at will tenant or responsible for the rent in any way. Any and all advice is appreciated since we're both young and have a baby on the way. Money is already tight and this wouldn't help at all. Thanks for reading. From my experience, and no I'm not a lawyer, if she is not on the lease she is not responsible. With out a written agreement to pay there is really not a lot of recourse anyone has for taking her to court. NAL but if she’s not on the lease, I don’t believe the landlord has standing to sue her for rent.
