 I went to check my mail yesterday and there was a package addressed to my partner from someone neither of us knew. He opens it and it’s a letter that is addressed to the same person that is listed as the sender. Weird. Quickly we decide to place it down and not touch it anymore in fear it may be laced with something. My partner is a bit of a hypochondriac so it begins to get very anxious about it, so I decide to call the cops to check it out. Cops initially don’t think it’s anything serious, but agree to come up and check it out for piece of mind. They take a look and find that there was a little travel pack of Benadryl inside that was already opened. Shakes it to find about 15 pills that pour out that definitely aren’t Benadryl. According to them it’s some type of amphetamine. What they also noticed is that it didn’t go through the USPS and someone else placed it in there. The apt number was written off on the side so looks the guess is that it was dropped off to the office where they wrote that on there. Cops took everything but that was basically it. We are the first ones to live in this unit so not like it wears meant for someone else. Also the handwriting in the letter was different than that of on the package. Basically we’re just a bit worried that this could happen again, maybe someone is targeting to fuck with us or they come looking for those drugs. We’re not sure but we’re just feeling very uncomfortable about it all and why this happened. I would just keep doing what you're doing, until the police say they don't want the packages anymore.
