A major retail company in Texas requires applicants complete a WOTC application in order to complete the job application. The WOTC app requires SSN and asks if applicant is over/under 40. If under 40, it requires date of birth. The information is sent to an unknown company with an unknown privacy policy. Can/Do these data affect applicants' applications? There is no way to circumvent the WOTC to complete a job app. What do? The required WOTC form is online and not connected to the IRS. The form appears by clicking "continue" on the online job app and directs to an unknown entity's page containing the WOTC form. Not illegal.

Is this the form?

I understand. But the employer requires an applicant to provide SSN and date of birth to an unknown company with no privacy policy in order to apply for a job. Thank you. Thank you. I am nearly certain there is no law making that illegal but it's a bad best practice for a number of reasons.  Applying. Cannot complete a job application without completing the WOTC app that requires SSN and DOB.

The employer is seeking a tax credit for employing individuals who may be members of groups who have employment hardships. Are these people who have been hired for the job or simply applying to the job?
