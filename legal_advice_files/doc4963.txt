 Sorry for the long post.. So on 10/4/2018 I was working for a construction company building residential homes, second day on the job. A nail gun I was using went off twice the first nail went into the intended target and the second went into my thumb.. right into the joint. I removed the nail from my thumb and wrapped it in gauze and ductape to continue working for another 4 hours before going to a clinic. My boss was not at the job site at the time of the incident. At the clinic my father and I said the incident had happened at home so I could get seen by a doctor right a way. They took X-rays and told me “it looks like a thumb”, the tendon was fine and it just needs time to heal. Ended up paying $75 for the clinic and thought it’d heal on its own. Well I no longer work for that construction company, A month and a half has gone by and I can’t move my thumb fully. My thumb locks up and I only have about 25% of the full range of motion of the joint. Doing simple things with my left hand have become very difficult and I’m thinking I’m going to need surgery. I was wondering if anyone had any insight on what steps I should take next. Thank you for all your responses! File a workers compensation claim with the construction company. However, you should expect that your claim will be denied based on your failure to provide immediate notice to your employer and your representation to the original treating physician that the injury did not happen at work.
