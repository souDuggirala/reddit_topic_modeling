 Hello all! Obligatory this is my first post and I’m on mobile. I’m posting this for my sister. She lives in a suburb outside of Minneapolis MN, and recently a bullet narrowly missed her outside of her apartment. It wasn’t aimed at her, and she’s okay, but the bullet became imbedded in the Sheetrock of her bedroom (she lives in an apartment complex). She’s spoken to the police and the landlord, and is trying to break her lease, but the landlords are refusing to let her go and are refusing to notify the other tenants nor the police of the shooting. They also aren’t going to fix the damage. Does my sister have any grounds to get out of her lease? She has about 6 months left. Thank you  She can notify the police and doesn't have to wait for the landlord to do so. If she wants to break her lease, she is bound to the terms outlined in the lease. This event doesn't change that.  Okay! Thank you for the info!  Doesn't much matter. The landlord is under no obligation to punish lawbreakers, that is a job for the police. The way she described it, it sounded like it was involving another tenant. It seems as though they’ve been removed from the property An unrelated party shooting at your house does not dissolve the legal contract you have with your landlord, no. They have no power or duty to prevent the actions of others.
