 What can I do if someone pretended to be me/a friend of mine and requested people to make fake nudes or photoshopped nudes of us on NSFW sites and forums? The person in question took the pictures from public sites and apps like Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram. The person did this to satisfy a kink and fetish but tells me that they had no intent to distribute or harass with the fakes they received. In addition this person does not live in the same state as me. What are my options? Are there any charges or offenses that are ideal even though we aren’t in the same states? Yeah it was from my social media profiles and he requested people to have them edited and the people he requested posted public galleries of us edited on the forums It’s kind of a weird situation, I’m not really sure that it would constitute a crime. I would guess these were photos that you posted to social media publicly that he took and tried to have edited? This is really more of a civil matter, and in a civil case you have to be able to show damages. If he had distributed these photos that would be very easy to do. But if those photos never made it to the public I assume that would be hard to do. Again your best bet would be to talk to a lawyer, you might be able to pursue some type of restraining order or court order to get him to stop. So are fake nudes not illegal in any manner? What about impersonating me but using a different name? Hmm, tbh I’m not sure what could be done then. A lot of lawyers will give you a free consult so I would still try and talk with a lawyer. That being said if he wasn’t distributing them I’m really not sure what you can do.  They were not. They were just requesting people to photoshop/fake nude our pictures for their own enjoyment They were distributing these fake photos across the internet? If so, save any written correspondence you have had with this person and then stop talking to them and contact a lawyer immediately.
