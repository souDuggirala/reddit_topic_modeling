 Hello All, I have been trying to understand how exactly the child support is calculated in California. I know that in most cases Dissomaster is used by attorneys to come up with a guideline amount. I used the following online calculator ([]()) and I came to conclusion that increasing my 401k contribution could lower my child support obligation. Is that correct? Thanks
