 We have seen a competitor use his own brand "Tims-Electric" to sell other well-known brand stuff (example Apple watch and Microsoft watch bundle). The product images clearly show apple/micrsoft but the product just says "Tims-Electric Watch Bundle" Has there been much legal precedent in this scenario? I'm thinking specifically about the trader joes / pirate joe's, but would be great to see more insight.   That's between the supplier and Tim. If you share a supplier and believe that Tim is outside the scope of the partner agreements, you can certainly tip them off. I honestly fail to see the benefit here. Other than perhaps name penetration. The average consumer can read what the box says, and aren't thinking that Tim is manufacturing an item with a big Apple logo on the box. Basically, one of our competitors shares a supplier with us. They have started selling items as their own brand. "Tims 5-Pack of electrical wires" i'm thinking that: - the supplier should be protecting their brand - I need to create my own brand... You see, Tim isn't actually putting his own label on the watches, rather labeling the bundle. They can't say that it's the "Tims-Electric SmartWatch", as the watch itself is trademarked by Apple. Apple has no ownership over the naming of an in store bundle, however. Major retailers like BestBuy and GameStop do this sort of thing all the time. I will say that if "Tim" is an Apple/Microsoft certified reseller, they can absolutely have their partnership revoked for unapproved bundles or prices, Apple specifically is very protective of their brand in this way.
