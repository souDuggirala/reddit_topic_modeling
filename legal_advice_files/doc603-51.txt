Posting for a friend

My friend is asthmatic and at their work they have these scented air machines all over the place that make it almost impossible for them to breathe. When the employer was asked about this, they merely responded with “deal with it.”  Despite one or two medications, my friend most certainly cannot just ‘deal with it.’

My friend is already in the process of getting a note from their doctor outlining their condition and requested accommodations, but they’re worried the employer still won’t do anything. What would be the next step if that were the case? So they don't have a note yet?  Until the employer is given notice of the disability and the employee requests reasonable accommodation there is nothing the employer needs to do.  If no changes happen after that, he may have an ADA claim against the employer. The next step at that point would likely be speaking to California's Department of Labor, for now I advise he screenshot any emails or texts pertaining to this and putting copies in a google doc on a personal email (NOT A WORK ONE) and printing out copies for himself at home. He should continue to explain the condition after the doctor's note should the employer refuse, and document with time and date stamps that he informed them, if possible he may want to record conversations (Though he'd have to ask directly if he consents to a recording) though that likely isn't necessary now.
