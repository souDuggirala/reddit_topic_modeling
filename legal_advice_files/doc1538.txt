 Title says it all, I’ve talked to others and they say it’s illegal, if I clock out I should be able to leave the building to get food or let me dog out. Thanks,   Depending on State required to pay time and a half for your lunch Or they have to pay you for working through your lunch, which is what most employers do when the employee can't leave during their 'lunch' break. They expect to continue to clean, answer doors if needed and phones. Take care of any dogs needs ect... That's not a duty free lunch if they expect you to do anything like answer door for dog drop off Well you don’t work at Fort Knox or the Pentagon. I don’t know how you could challenge this but I would.  It’s a 3rd shift job, I am the only one there, No contract. All 3rd shift employees can not leave. The only reason they give is because they are a 24 hour drop off and need to be there if an emergency happens.  What kind of job do you have? Is there a contract or agreement you signed with this on there? Does everyone else have to follow this same rule? Is there a good reason for them to have this policy, security, etc?
