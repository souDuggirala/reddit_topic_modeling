 I have a fairly urgent and hopefully simple question. My landlord (3 buildings. 32 units or so per building) has had three cigarette inspections throughout the last year. Their claim is that they have apartments that have complained about smoke (non smoking complex), but they can not target a single apartment for inspection and must inspect the entire building due to federal FHA rules. This is in addition to the other inspections which have them entering our apartment once every 8 to 10 weeks over the last year on 24 hour notice. As a rent paying tenant (unsubsidized. Non section8) I view this as a violation of privacy, and contest that FHA does not, in fact, require blanket inspections for violations of lease. Can anybody add to the discussion and provide me with some input? I've looked through FHA statutes and haven't really found anything explicit... Thanks! The lease agreement should stipulate restrictions and the terms of inspection. There’s usually a clause which indicates the ability to inspect within a reasonable advance notice. Also, there’s a typical penalty clause for breach of the terms of agreement you signed. I always advise keeping a copy of the lease in case of disagreements and to consult with legal counsel.
