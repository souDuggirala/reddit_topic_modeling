 I have moved in to an apartment complex that allows pets and has a pet addendum on the lease but it was left blank when we all initially signed the lease. I remember them saying there was a fee but since it was left blank and we both signed it does that mean I do not have to pay anything? I’m the future never leave blanks when you are signing a contract. Draw a line through it and initial or write “n/a” and initial.  Then I can fill it to be $0 too Awesome! Thank you Just because a document is blank, doesn't give you or anyone free reign of the document(s). It isn't much different. You are signing a legal document that can be filled in by anybody at any time If you all agreed on a fee beforehand and there was a written error in the lease leaving it blank the landlord is allowed to rectify the error in the lease to reflect the actual agreement you had. There's a lot of parts that were left blank because they weren't applicable at the time and what we signed then is what was agreed upon. This is much different than a check and your comment isn't really helpful lol Or a million dollars. Would you write a check and leave the amount blank?
