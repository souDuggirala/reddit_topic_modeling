 I have been the elected, volunteer treasurer of my small (@150 member) labor union since 9/2018. I ran for office because I felt there was, at the very least, ineptitude, and at the very most, embezzlement, happening. An audit of the past 2 years show the president used the union credit card improperly in the amount of over $19,000. She has paid back $7k. Because of what I found upon taking office, my union is now the subject of a Department. of Labor criminal audit. I have been severely bullied by members of the Executive Board. The vice-president quit due to their behavior, and our accountant/auditor also quit. I have decided to resign as well, because I do not want to expose myself to all of this any longer, legally, personally or professionally. Our general membership knows nothing of what has been going on, because the Executive Committee has been keeping it a secret. My question is - can I legally tell them? Do I have a legal responsibility to tell them?
