 I live in Arizona, was visiting California and went to the hospital August 10th 2018 for strep throat and ended up getting an X-ray. At the time my insurance had my birthday wrong, so the hospital was unable to bill my insurance and now we are here today, months later and I received a bill from CMRE Financial Services in Brea California. I have no idea who these people are but they sent me a bill of $400 regarding the xrays I got. I called the number on the bill and told them what happened, gave them my insurance and then they told me I needed to send a letter of eligibility from my insurance. I said okay, hung up and called my insurance who then said they don’t offer letters of eligibility to third parties like debt collectors. I then called the hospital I went to and tried to give them my insurance, the woman there told me the CMRE place needs to handle this on their own, that I have given all the necessary information and that it is up to them to get the bill paid from the info I gave them. I then called back the CMRE debt collectors and told them this, went around in circles and ended up hanging up on them because they were unwilling to budge. They claim they can’t look up my insurance, can’t call my insurance and need my insurance to call them or give them a letter. What do I do? I’m so stressed out, I’m only 19 and I don’t want debt and bad credit because of this stupid hospital bill... How do I fix and resolve this?  Call your insurance and ask if it's possible to pay the bill yourself, then get reimbursed. It can take a little time, but it might be an easy(ish) way out of this.
