 CA - I have an auto loan that I aquired from June 2018 and forgot to change my insurance over so for a few months I was TECHNICALLY uninsured with that car but definitely still paying for insurance. I found the error and fixed it but my lender charged me $3000 for their "insurance" that when I called as asked about they said wouldn't even cover me for ANYTHING so of course I informed them of my policy and they refunded SOME of the balance but added abour $1300 for their garbage insurance. I made multiple over payments for this as they said I needed to so it's paid but now my payment has increased. I can prove all of this, lawyer solicitations welcome as I have NO idea who to talk to. that they will purchase insurance for me, i understand that and I PAID that amount to cover the balance so there's no extra principal to be added. right, and I paid the cost of that insurance.  Your contract very likely allows them to charge you if you are driving uninsured.  What does your agreement say about lapses in insurance coverage?
