 Should i act like it never happened? Should i say something to her/her brother/her parents? Of so, what should I say? And lastly I know how the internet is so before anyone asks no I will not send them to you and if you ask anyway you will be reported. But many parents are. They could get the OP in prison for child porn Her parents need to know so they can put a stop to it. If OP is concerned about speaking to them directly, he can ask an attorney to talk to them on his behalf since the attorney doesn't have to divulge his name. My daughter is 14 and I would want to know if she were engaging in this behavior, and I'm not illogical enough to go after the person who reported it to me. OP, do not tell her parents that you are or were in possession of child pornography of their minor daughter. Delete the images, block her number and do not have any contact with her ever. Anything else she may have done is not your problem and you should not make it your problem. Tell her parents in addition to deleting the pictures from your phone and blocking her number. Chances are that if she's sent these types of pictures to you then she's sent them to others. INAL, but it's my understanding that, keeping, requesting, and distributing are the crimes. I agree with non contact between you two, especially if you've asked her to stop or to not to begin with. Better to not have to make the argument in the first place than to plead your case.  Delete the images and block her number.
