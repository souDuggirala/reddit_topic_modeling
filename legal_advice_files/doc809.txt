 I love going to the park and playing with the girls there. Sometimes I bring my nephew but I can't always bring him. The park is near a neighborhood, so sometimes girls will come there without their parents, but sometimes the parents do show up and I've gotten my ass kicked a fair amount of times lol. So if someone calls the cops on me, (even though I'm not technically breaking the law), can they ban me from a public park, since it's owned by the government? I'm 31 and I live in southern usa. How is it creepy? I'm not hurting anyone. The girls like playing with me. Location? How old are you? If you're an adult and engaging in play with children you don't know, that's downright creepy behavior and you should stop.
