 Hi LA, I'm interested in a situation where the sole beneficiary (not related to the testator) predeceases the testator by some years. I'm aware that in most jurisdictions the estate will pass to the residuary beneficiaries, but I'm actually more interested in the role of the executor. If there are no living beneficiaries to the will, is the appointment of the nominated executor still valid, or is the will considered intestate and subject to distribution by an administrator? Thanks for any input you may have.
