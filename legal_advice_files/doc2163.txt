 today was the first time they wanted to apply in the apartments. they had notices and stuff they'd be here today. i have a camera that would show they were there. can i get a refund? you sure about that? Would figure charging for a service not provided would be illegal in some way or another. Did you ask them why they didn't show? Either way, no.  Pest control happens outside too.
