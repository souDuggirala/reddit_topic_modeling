If you want to pay a lawyer to go ham on your employer, go ahead (they vary from $100 to $700 an hour). I would personally just talk to payroll /manager /HR and get this fixed though.... Much cheaper.  Thank you. After three comments saying essentially 'see if they'll fix it first', I am starting to realize I rather freaked out over this. I have sent a message, will probably hear back on Monday. Thank you. As with the other comment, is there anything else I can and/or should do between now and hearing back from them? Thank you. I have texted my manager about it, but he can't do anything until Monday when he comes in to work. Is there anything else I can and/or should do in the meantime, to prepare for a worst case scenario? Talk to HR before you go suing your workplace over what could be a silly mistake.  Contact your payroll department and politely ask them to explain and fix it before you consider getting a lawyer.  I would talk to your HR department before you hire an attorney, it might be a simple mistake.
