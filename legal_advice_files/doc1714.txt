 This is something that has been on my mind ever since a friend of mine served Jury Duty and I’m curious to hear people’s opinion of this. The way that folks are summoned for Jury Duty, it is a completely random process where the county pulls records of everyone who has a driver’s license, state ID, or is registered to vote. These lists are compiled and de-duped (as best as possible) and then the county clerk and a judge pick a number between 1 and 10 and that number is how they pick individuals on every 10th person. So for example, if the number picker was 6. They would pick persons 6, 16, 26, 36, etc and so on until they had the amount of prospective jurors they needed. Okay with that explanation, let’s say that a young white male was the defendant, and through the jury selection process, it was narrowed down to a prospective jury pool of African Americans, Hispanic, and older white males and females (no younger white males on the prospective jury pool) Now, if you use the Webster Definition of “Peer” we could all agree that that this prospective jury pool is not a “Jury of the defendant’s peers” However, if we look at this question at the lowest common denominator (race aside), If the only way that the prospective Jury could be comprised of individuals who hold a driver’s license, state ID, or are registered to vote AND due to the fair random process of how people are summoned: IF the defendant fits one or more of those qualifications, would he not be a peer of members of the prospective Jury? If he/she fits one of those qualifications, the only reason why the defendant couldn’t have been summoned is because of the predicament they are in. Thoughts? We live in a Republic. Your fellow citizens are your peers. Nice try, but it's not going to help you get out of whatever you did. Your peers are the community you live in.
