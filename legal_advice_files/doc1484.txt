 Apologies if this would be better suited elsewhere... Basically, I haven't always filed my taxes. A lot of my younger working years were spent as working poor, and I know there were a few years where I owed money and simply couldn't pay... so I didn't. I've found a decent enough job now and I'm trying to fix my past mistakes, including handling my unpaid taxes for prior years. What's the best way to go about this for both State (PA) and federal? I don't have a lot left in my budget month-to-month, so I'm worried about simply calling and asking, lest they ask me to settle in full right away. Is there a better approach? Do I need a CPA? A lawyer? Beilievethey,will work with you payments id just contact irs.
