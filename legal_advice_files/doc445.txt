 I'm interested in being a private investigator, but I do have a question regarding confidentiality. I know that as a PI I'm required to keep private information secret with clients. But am I allowed to talk about professionals I worked with? Like if I work with a lawyer, am I able to acknowledge working with them? Or even if I don't mention working with them, if I think they're a good lawyer, is it legal for me to recommend them to a client if the client requests a recommendation for a lawyer? I know I can't say "I worked with Attorney Jane Doe, and she did a great job representing her client Jamie Dee when she was sued by her employer." I'm just wondering how far confidentiality goes with cases. It's something I thought about when I was looking for a lawyer for myself (note, I'm not a PI yet). You can absolutely recommend attorneys. You can't identify individual clients, but a statement similar to "XXX is who I'd recommend as a divorce attorney" or "I've heard good things about XXX for handling business matters". It's pretty common for professional services (accountants, lawyers, etc.) to build and maintain working relationships with each other based on such referrals.
