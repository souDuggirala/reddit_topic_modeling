 I’m in university and applied for a lease for an apartment online. I just got the email for confirmation for my lease and I did a bunch of online signatures for the lease as well. Unfortunately I’m an idiot and mistakenly put my move in AND move out date on the same exact day of July 31, 2019. Am I able to change my move out date even though I got the confirmation for the lease? I haven’t even got a specific apartment yet but I filled out the entire process. Call and ask, but no one is legally required to change the contract.
