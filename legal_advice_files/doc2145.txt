 My ex is a decent father. He loves the kids but has had some trouble financially that keep him from getting a place of his own and lives with family. We have joint custody, as the situation was different when we divorced. I wouldve contested it if were as it is now. He had his own place and was doing well for himself. The custody agreement states he must be married before living with a person of the opposite sex, including overnight stays. He's become engaged after 8 months to a woman that has lost custody of her own children, the court documents state drug issues and rehab. I've asked him about it and he gives me a sad story about how everyone in her life has taken advantage of her. He asked me today if they could move in together and I said no. I don't know her and the court finds shes unfit to parent her own children, so she won't be parenting mine. He says that when they get married I won't have a say in the matter. I plan to retain an attorney when I have the money saved as I haven't budgeted for this. He says that I'm just trying to"win" but I honestly only want what's best for my kids and this whole situation makes my stomach turn Any advice is welcome, thanks in advance. Yep, get consultations with attorneys. The state has the court records available,and I've read through it, drugs and involuntary commitment we're noted  Follow your instincts. For now, contact your state bar referral service and get a low cost consultation. You can even shop around getting several low cost consultations. An attorney will be able to review the last court order, discuss possible pros and cons of the current and future situations, and advise you on how to prepare. Do you have enough information to run a criminal background check? Go get the court order showing when and why she lost custody of her children (it may not be for a bad reason--and this is something you want to know, too).
