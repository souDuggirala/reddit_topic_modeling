 Landed in Austria tonight. We were delayed about 5 hours at the rental car center. We showed up to our hotels at 2am and got our room. Our friends went to a different hotel but it didn’t have anyone at reception. They asked if they could crash in our room. I asked my receptionist (very old guy). He said yes for an extra $50. I went upstairs and to text my friend. When I came back downstairs, 15 mins later, he told me to leave. Said That I’m crazy and not right in the head. He seemed very bipolar in the moment. He called me a bandit and said my friends can’t come and that now he’s kicking me out. So he gets me to go outside of the hotel in the cold and says this is my last night here and to leave in the morning. the whole experience was Very confrontational but it didn’t escalate into any physicality. I’m very confused right now. I don’t know what happened and I don’t know the laws here. Can I be evicted just like that with no actual cause? Normally I would have left and took my money somewhere else but in this tiny village there is nothing available- it’s all booked up. Plus is paid upfront for a week. Thanks in advance!
