Back in August I let a couple take care/temporarily foster my pittie. A few days ago the girl emailed me and said that her boyfriend was abusive and she was going to leave him and give me back my dog. Yesterday she was going to message me when to get my dog back but her boyfriend found out and took my dog and we both dont know where he is. Can we do anything? Btw we are in California. I would post in lost and found groups to see if someone might know where she is but u just dont want her boyfriend to find out and kill my dog or beat the girl. I just want my dog back and I want the girl safe. Please dont give me rude comments, I really didnt know the dude was like this when I let them take care of my dog. File a police report.
