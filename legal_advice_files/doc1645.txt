 Location: Los Angeles, Ca I accidentally scratched the floor (8 pieces of compressed wood/ laminate type flooring) in a house I used to live in. I'm 100% willing to fix it, the only problem is my landlord didn't buy any extra when she had it installed and now it's been discontinued for 3 years. The landlord is now telling me that the only option is to replace the flooring in the entire house so that it would all match. This would cost me several thousand dollars as opposed to $300 to fix just the scratch if I can find this discontinued flooring (which isn't likely). Is my ex-landlord's request fair/ legal/ reasonable?
