 I’m 17- my parents are going to Hawaii at the end of January and I’m thinking of having a party while they’re gone. I have a boatload of alcohol at my house and don’t want to risk any gigantic legal trouble towards me or my parents Only reason I ask is because my neighbors have a proven history of calling the cops on any party that happens in my neighborhood.  I'm sorry, but you are basically announcing how stupid you are, then asking us to tell you how stupid you are. Your idea is totally stupid, don't do it. In addition to what others have mentioned, everyone at the party under 21 runs the risk of violation leading to driver's license suspension, revocation, or denial: Underage possession and Underage consumption. You don't even have to be driving at the time. Maximum: 90 days. A first conviction of underage purchase, possession, or consumption is twenty-four hours of public service, if ordered by the court, or three months. There is no State-imposed liability for hosting underage drinking parties. First offense fines can equal $50 at court, excluding the price of alcohol treatment programs and lawyer's fees. Second and third offenses are greeted with harsher penalties of 6 months and 12 months of a suspended license, respectively. As the host of the party, expect them to come down hard on you as an example and charges/penalties can exponentially increase. Don't do it at your parents house. Find somewhere else to throw a party.  I doubt your parents want to take one for the team. Bad idea.  You highly run the risk of significant property damage. You run the risk of getting an underage and getting your parents in trouble.
