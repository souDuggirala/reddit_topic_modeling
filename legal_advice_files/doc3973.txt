 The mortgage is in both their names and is soon to be paid off. The utility bills, gas, electric and water, are all in his name and are on autopay every month. The only thing that goes into his account is the pension in my moms name. We want to close my dads account and have the pension and all the bills deducted from an account in my moms name but are worried that bank will charge us some kind of penalty or something worse. What can we do? This isn't a legal question. It's a question about filling out forms for your dad's pension plan. None of us are going to know how to do that for you. Having said that, it sounds like you guys haven't done anything in regards to his estate if you're still using his bank account and his name are still on the utilities. Have you guys even probated his estate?
