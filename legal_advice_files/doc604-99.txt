I parked my vehicle in a private commercial parking spot (my mistake) and it was towed. I fully accept responsibility for that part. I went to pick up my car today, paid for the release, and noticed the engine running abnormally loud. I took it to the mechanic who said the muffler was damaged. I highly suspect the car was damaged during towing. How should I proceed?

Details:
- Car was last maintained and inspected a month prior for winter tires. No issues with muffler then. 
- Car last driven 2 days ago, no issues then.
- Towing was initiated by the commercial property who contacted city by-law. I have a parking ticket from by-law, but the towing was done by a third party private company.
- The release I signed for the car does not include any language about damage or liability. Ah shucks, I didnâ€™t think of that. I mentioned the problem to the front desk and they gave me an email to file a report, which I did.  Do you have any proof that the damage was done by the towing company? Once you drive it off the lot you lose a lot of ability to say they caused the damage. One of the reasons I always tell people to document any damages and maybe even call their insurance company prior to taking their vehicle off the tow lot.
