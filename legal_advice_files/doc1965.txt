 Specifically what breaks, or meal penalty implications would an hourly employee be due on... a 16hr+ and even 24hr+ shift. Non industry specific, though this pertains to live entertainment/events. It's not clear to me, on any 12hr+ shift, can you be asked to skip two meal breaks and be given two meal penalties? At what point would a third and fourth meal be due? By law unless specified in a contract you can skip one but not both. You will only get one penalty per shift.
