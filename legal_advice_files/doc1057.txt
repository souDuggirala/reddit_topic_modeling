 Indiana. Using a throwaway to prevent doxing. The neighborhood drug dealer has been harassing my family for years. Big time bigot this one, gets off on committing hate crimes against us, and yes the Civil Rights Commission is investigating but no determination yet. I was out on my land (very clearly marked by survey last year) and the druggy waddled out. Kept cussing at me, kept getting closer. I started getting nervous, told druggy to stay back. Druggy kept getting closer, stayed about 6ft away for a minute or two. Then druggy points to the ground behind me, I looked out of reflex. I turned around and druggy was easily within arms reach of me. It scared the fuck out of me, and I pushed druggy back in like half an adrenaline filled second. I should note that I was on my land and druggy was on public land Of course druggy went crying to the police. They talked to me for a bit but didn't arrest me. They made some bs about being required to refer to the prosecutor because poor druggy claims to have gotten an owie. I am going to talk to a lawyer on Monday, but until then can folks help give me some peace of mind. Any chance druggy gets me in criminal trouble, like charges or a protective order? Any chance that druggy has grounds for a lawsuit, or would win a civil suit? Thanks folks.  Are they really? Doesn't Indiana not even really have hate crime laws? Were y'all just staring at each other for that time or...? Tbh a lot of this seems odd to me, but if he was really injured then you might have actually committed battery. Except I would be surprised if you got into any criminal trouble over an aggressive drug dealer saying you pushed him while he was trespassing. Simply shoving someone away from you isn't likely to send them to the hospital and he would need medical bills or something to prove injury. If he doesn't have any medical bills or other financial damage then he has no basis for a civil lawsuit against you either.
