 My university held a raffle of $500 back in the Fall semester of 2016. My college has yet to pay me my award after mentioning it to them multiple times. What actions can I take to receive my reward. I am in the state of Virginia A college that holds raffles and then stiffs the winner? I thought Trump University has been shut down. They’ve breached a contract with you. Take them to conciliation or small claims court or whatever they call it there. Small filing fee that gets added to your award. They’ll pay up once you file. Make them pay the filing fee too.
