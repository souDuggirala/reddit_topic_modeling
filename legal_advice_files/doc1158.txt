 So I work in a restaurant that has private events. Sometimes there is leftover wine after an event and recently management has decided to resell the leftover wine and sell it by the glass. Normally we would either drink it or throw it out. It just seems weird to me that they are reselling a bottle that has already been paid for (I call it double-dipping). I’m wondering if anyone knows if there are any laws against it. (I’m in New Jersey btw) And if you’re wondering the guests do have an option to take the rest home they just usually don’t. It’s coming from the restaurant and purchased from the restaurant. It’s not wine that was brought by the customer. Another thing to consider... If the wine at the private events is not bought by the restaurant, but rather by whoever puts on the event, that may well violate the restaurant's distributors agreements and could also violate state ABC laws. Yea I was trying to look to see but it’s really not easy to find. I might have to call ABC for NJ and see if they can help me. They are definitely opened and served. Usually half empty or else. This is VERY common for venues that hold events... I went to one event at a private box at a NASCAR track one time and the bartenders gave me 2 cases of beer to take home because they didn't like how the management would just put it back in inventory even though it had already been paid for. The only time I could see it being a problem is if the state liquor board had rules against it, but those might not be as easy to find as state statutes. Are they bottles that were open and placed on the tables? If yes, then questionable, if they're sealed, then I don't see why they wouldn't sell it again.  Gotcha that makes sense. Thank you. If the guests have the option to take the wine home and choose not to, then they have gifted it back to the restaurant and the restaurant can do whatever they want with it. Including not giving it to you.
