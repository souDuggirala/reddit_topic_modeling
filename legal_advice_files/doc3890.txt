 Hello. I traveled for work last month to Boulder and stayed at one of the multinational hotels. The next morning I had severe flu like symptoms and kept throwing up for the rest of the day. Had to skip work that day and went to the doctor next day. The doctor thought it was altitude sickness and prescribed nausea and headache medication. Felt better for the rest of the week. The following week I got a call from the hotel asking me if I had flu like symptoms. She drops a bomb saying they had a carbon monoxide incident and gave me a claim number and phone number. Haven't gone to the doctor yet but what are my options for getting compensated? Thanks! Given that you answered your own questions about how you get compensated, I'm going to make a wild guess that your real question is "can I sue them for a pile of dollars?" And the answer is "you can try, but unless you can demonstrate significant injury or long-term impact to your life, you're not looking at a big payday. And you'd need a lawyer to help you, and a lawyer is going to take a big chunk of your winnings so you could wind up in worse shape."  Have you considered... calling the phone number? ... to call the claim number. That's why they gave it to you. So they can compensate you.   I think that phone number and your claim number would be a great place to start. You should be reimbursed/can sue for any damages you incur from this. Such as medical bills.
