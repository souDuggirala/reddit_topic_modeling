 I know someone awaiting trial for a drugs felony. They were arrested in one state, and have property in two other states. His court records record him as living in one state, but he also lives with his wife in a third state. I also know they own property abroad. I have a suspicion they might be trying to hide this information from the DA this, but I've no real idea. Would the DA likely know all this? And if not, would you contact the DA's office to provide this information?  That's the problem, I don't fancy being called as a witness.  You could always call the DA's office and tell them that you have information that may be relevant to X case. Then wait and see if they call you back and go from there. If you contact them, be prepared to be called as a witness if the information is useful. Fair enough, that was my thought as well. They might not care, and it may not be important (that's why I asked) Sure, let them know. They probably won't care. I suspect that the proceeds would be sitting in Florida and overseas. As a result, they may be trying to hide the proceeds of that crime and either take it out of state and out of the country.  How exactly is that information useful?
