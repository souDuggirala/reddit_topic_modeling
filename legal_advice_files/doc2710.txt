 Hello! Some background- I'm 16 years old, going to high school full time and working about 25 hours a week. I saved money from my job and recently bought a guitar valued at $1,149 new, but due to some cosmetic flaws was purchased for $919. nbsp; My mother has taken issue with this and took it upon herself to make sure I return it, going as far as to take the guitar and pack it up for shipment back to the address that was on the box I received it in. In case it wasn't clear, I am NOT okay with this. nbsp; From what research I've done, most sources seem to say that as a minor I have little to no property rights, but others have said that if it's purchased with my own money (it was) then I own it outright. nbsp; Which side is true? Are her actions something I can prevent? Any help is appreciated! nbsp; ps. If this is something that isn't appropriate for this sub and/or a dumb question feel free to tell me and I'll take it some place else. This is a correct sub - but perhaps given you are probably out of luck wrt to the lost guitar, it may also be worth posting to /r/relationship_advice to seek advice about other options. my $0.02 - without knowing the rest of the back story, on the surface your mum seems pretty toxic/OTT. You may wanna think about bringing forward plans to move out as soon as you are mentally, legally and financially able to do so. Also, I get wanting to own a nice guitar - but perhaps may be worth buying an old beater for $50 until you can sort your situation with your mum.  This is the correct sub You may not like the answer, but legally your mom has the right to make this decision.  You're a minor. Your parents or guardians can generally do what they please in your interests.
