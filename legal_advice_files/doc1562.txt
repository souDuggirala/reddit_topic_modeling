 Thank you for the info. This person owes less than 5% of the value of their home. I imagine they would not let it get that far. My lawyer had sent a letter when he filed the writ saying we would be seeking costs if we had to execute. Is it rare for someone to receive costs for this? There’s nothing that requires a lawyer but you’ll need to get an appraisal, do a title search, get payout statements for any registered mortgages or other writs, file an affidavit for enforcement, pay the processing fee to the sheriff and pay a $5000 deposit to the sheriff for their expenses conducting the sale. That sound like something you can do yourself?
