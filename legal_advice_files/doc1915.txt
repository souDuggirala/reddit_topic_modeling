 My elderly mother was entering a mall in Memphis, TN and the floors inside the walkway were wet. There was no wet sign or other warnings to notify of the condition. She is of sound mind but is disabled and has other medical conditions (polio as a kid, osteoporosis). She slipped and fell on her arm and hurt herself severely. she finally got peoples attention and security came and tried to help her up but she could not because she was in too much pain - she just laid there for about 20 minutes. EMT came and took her out on a stretcher. The doctor told us she fractured her arm and is now in a sling. Due to other medical conditions - she is not doing well right now but she is getting by. What should my next step be in reference to the malls negligence? Can/should i even do anything? Does my mom have a case? The mall/security did not once apologize or even reach out to her. Any guidance would be great.  Call a local personal injury lawyer immediately.
