 I was caught at school with the powder of edibles no real evidence unless they test it but should i say im not guilty or guilty and if so what is the most likely punishment for this? if i say im not what will happen im also 17 and i live in ohio  This powder can be tested extremely cheaply. Denial only gets you so far.  Puppy Chow Powder  If it's just crumbs then I'd just go the deny route. Unless they can prove something just deny Weed brownie crumbs (type of thing) powder of edibles.....please elaborate
