 My management company clears walkways and sidewalks of snow, but the buildings have multiple flights of stairs and landings that get snow but aren't removed by shovel or de-icer. The snow can party melt and refreeze making ice that is slippery and seems a little dangerous to walk on, and there is no elevator or other way to get up and down the stairs. Is there a place I can look into to find specifics about snow removal and de-icer placement on stairs and landings? They can't outperform Mother Nature. Be careful or move to a state that doesn't get ice or snow. COLORADO LANDLORD AND TENANT DUTIES ยง 38-12-503.
