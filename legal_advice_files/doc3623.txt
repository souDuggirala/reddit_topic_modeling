 So, I have a gaming website and I have a shop. I am in Photoshop working on designs and I am not sure if this would get the OK or not. Basically, there's a protein called "Sonic Hedgehog". So I want to recreate the image of the protein: And kind of make it more in the shape of this: with the text "Gotta go fast" Would this be infringement of the real Sonic the Hedgehog character? I'm VERY new to copyright laws and such, so please go easy on me. Thanks!
