 Not to sure if this is the right subreddit to ask but here goes... Does anyone know where I could file a complaint regarding an optometrist? Like a medical board or something? Long story short, had an appointment 11/14, canceled glasses that evening (via voicemail, they were closed the next day for some reason), got confirmation they were canceled 11/16 but I yet to receive my refund. I’ve gotten VSP (insurance) and my healthcare card involved and they all have agreed they should have refunded ASAP. They’ve given me so many excuses and refuse to refund the money I paid for the glasses. The main reason is that they are waiting for VSP to pay the claim before they’ll refund me. When speaking with VSP, they filled out the form incorrectly and was stuck in limbo. VSP contacted the office directly and told them how to fix it. It’s been filed and the optometrist has been paid as of 12/15 but still no refund. I won’t sue for the amount owed- $80 roughly but I’d like some advice as to if this is legal, to hold my refund “just in case VSP doesn’t pay your claim”. I’m in Tennessee btw. Thanks in advance.  Your HSA account? Call the number on the back of the card, see if they'll do a chargeback. With my healthcare card, from my employer  Absolutely. I'm just saying this has nothing to do with your optometrist's license. How did you pay for the glasses? Canceled my glasses order. However, the optical “shop” is in the same office and should hold the same standards.  This is confusing. Did you cancel your appointment, or did you go to your appointment, order a pair of glasses, and then cancel that order of glasses? I'm thinking the latter, in which case you wouldn't file anything with any board of licensing, because the optical shop is retail and seperate from the optometrist.
