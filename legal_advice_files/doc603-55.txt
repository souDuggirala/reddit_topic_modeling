[removed] Hi, thanks for the response. Price per word was discussed previously in the email so it was implied that it was $0.05 per word. 

I assumed I eas going to get pad because she said we will give you a trial at $0.05.

I should be able to get you a screenshot of the job post.

And it says the email was deleted because it was in the trash on my email. First off, where does it say $00.05 per word?  I see the $00.05 but I don't see per word.  (I could very well have glanced over it.)  


Second, do you know if you were going to get paid just for submitting the article or after the article was published?


Third, do you have a screengrab of where this gig was posted?  I'd be curious how it was advertised.


Fourth, I'm curious about all the places it says that the message has been deleted. [removed]
