 I purchased a vehicle that I would've probably paid $1-2000 less for if I had known the actual mileage. I have the title/registration from the previous owner. Researching the VIN, I see they bought it at an auction earlier this month, rolled back the odometer, and sold it to me. The VIN provided to me prepurchase belonged to a vehicle same make/model with 60,000 less miles. My dumbass forgot to check the VIN during my inspection. The cars great, fortunately. I'd just like to know what actions I can take. Thank you. I have a link to the auction page stating the mileage and date purchased. They held it for a week and sold it to me. Wouldn't this be enough? Not if the first seller bought it while it had under 60,000 miles. Even if you could prove what was done, your issue is going to be proving who did it. Vehicles at auctions are also sold "as is". Yeah I ordered a Carfax for the VIN they provided the day before I purchased, showing 138k no accidents 1 owner. The VIN on my actual car shows 198k, 2 owners, no accidents. And on my dash my odometer shows 138k. My mechanic says it definitely had been tampered with. Is this a carfax? Because they can be wrong.
