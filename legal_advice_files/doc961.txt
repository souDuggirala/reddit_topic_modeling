 I recently had my bike wheels stolen off my bike. It was parked in front of the apartment complex's camera's, so the crime was presumably recorded. I reported this to the police and mentioned that they can talk to the complex about viewing their cameras (they will only view them with the police). Eventually, I got this email back from an officer about my case: I googled a citizen's arrest at it sounds like I can only do this for a misdemeanor if I witnessed the crime myself, which I definitely didn't (though it presumably was recorded by the cameras, which I doubt I could get access to). The total repair/replacement cost was \~$300, so definitely not worth filing with renter's insurance. What should I do here? I mostly just want there to be actual consequences to the crime since bike theft has gotten particularly bad in this area. It seems insane that a theft can be recorded and there are still no legal repercussions. Is my understanding correct that filing this form and letting the cops "arrest the suspect for me" is a terrible idea? Yes, it would be a terrible idea. That form is done on penalty of perjury. You would throw away any chance of prosecution and get yourself a nice fat felony, and since its all on paper, its really easy to prove. Renter's insurance claim is your best option. It won't go up that much for such a claim. You can call back the officer and say you're willing to cooperate with any prosecution as a witness, but since you didn't witness the crime directly, you can't fill out that form and be honest. And that you recognize doing so would both wreck this case, and get you in serious trouble.
