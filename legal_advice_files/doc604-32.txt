I recently started getting my wages garnished for medical debt (to a hospital that refused to treat me, irrelevant but I felt it important to mention). I don't have a usual work year though and I'm wondering how it will effect the garnishment. Essentially I get fired/laid off for about 6-8 weeks and then rehired at the beginning of the new work season. New background check and drug test and onboarding process and all. When I am rehired, since it is the same company, will the garnishment resume from that first check coming back or will I have a few weeks while the collection agency has to refile paperwork?
