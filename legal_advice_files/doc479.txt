 Posting for a friend. My friend (17) needs ID, Birth Certificate, SS. His mom withdrew him from school early December (he lived with a family member for like a month because he was kicked out before she did this) and tried to take him to a boot camp around the first week of January. On the way there they got into an argument hours away from where they live and so he got out and ran off. He was able to hitchhike back to where he lives but his mom told him she wants nothing to do with him and she doesn’t care what happens to him. He’s asked her for his birth certificate and social security card and she refuses to give it to him. He’s also tried to have various family members ask her, and she will not give them to them either. I’m worried about him since he’s been staying with some trucker. And he’s upset that he’s missed so much school, he was supposed to graduate in May and cannot get a job to earn money. What can he do? He doesn’t turn 18 until August. We live in GA Besides calling children's services, he can go to the school. They will have a copy of his birth certificate on file. Many schools also have social workers who can assist in getting a certified copy of the BC, plus a state ID and a new copy of his social security card. They will likely help by placing him in a temporary youth shelter/group home. There will be rules to follow, and he should be able to get back in school, even if it is an alternative school, so he can get finished. First off CPS should be contacted here, parents cannot just throw out minors and he needs to be back in school. Does he have any photo ID? Like from school maybe? He can contact the police because she cannot legally kick him out a minor. Other than that, nothing. He's not an adult.
