 Have had my kids doing online school for 9 years but I took them out in 11th grade right after they turned 16(can drop out at 16 in our state) they are 17 now, I'm withholding their ssn's and refusing to drive them to get ID's so that they can pay to get themselves a phone to share and driving lessons. I also do not want them to have a job as I'm not driving them or teaching them how to. I have not had them fully vaccainted that is why I have had them doing online school. With that said, none of this is illegal? It is not morally my fault, correct? Is it not legall my fault either? Tennessee It is. This genius is a frequent flier with this exact same dumbass post. This is a troll, right? I refuse to believe this isn't a troll  I hope this is a troll, if not youâ€™re a terrible parent None of this makes any sense and I'm concerned for your children.
