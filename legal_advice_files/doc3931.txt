 I don’t want to be tracked. My home and where I going to is in Illinois, however after some time I will be headed to Wisconsin. My dad’s company gave him insurance from NJ.  But my name is still on his insurance so I would still have that, which would mean I still need to report right? No, don't list his insurance. If you have your own list that. Watch your bills/ EOB's. You can't force him to remove you, although you could call BC/BS and let them know you're not on the policy. I thought it was a legal question because I need to get off of his insurance but he will not take me off? He will probably keep it still on for me so Id have to use it because dr offices want you to use both your insurances otherwise its fraud. It's not a legal question, but... Don't use the insurance. If you need to see a Dr. either pay cash or purchase insurance independently.
