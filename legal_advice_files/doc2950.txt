 Last year my previous roommate (randomly assigned) took my PS4 and brought it to his room when I went away for a couple of days. I asked for it back in which he offered to purchase it. Yet 2 months later I only get $50 out of like $300, and I have to move out earlier than him Long story short, I filed a criminal charge against him instead of a civil charge. He paid the bail and didn't show up and moved away this was may last year. I have a copy of the text of him threatening to throw my PS4 downstairs if I talk to the apartment complex I guess I'll bring that. The judge will deduct the $50 he gave me from the value of my ps4 Now I got a supoena as a plaintiff on be half of my state, what am I going there for? Should I put a suit on or a button down shirt is fine? What do I need to know? I have never been to court before  They are calling you as a witness. They will ask you questions about the transaction, and the defendant's attorney will get to cross-examine you. Assuming they are calling you for trial at the courthouse (the subpoena will say this), I would recommend looking as polished as you can. A suit will obviously work, but if you don't have one, a nice button-down and nice slacks also work. Basically, don't look like a bum - look like you're going somewhere important (because you are) and like you take the proceedings seriously.
