 Hello, In a previous post I posted that I got rear ended by a commercial van. I signed with a lawyer yesterday. And I think I got a good deal by him. We signed at 25%, instead of his usual 40%. He honored and ARAG legal plan that I had that mentioned that he could only get 25% of any payout that is made. I was refereed to him by a lawyer who was under the ARAG plan, but who did not take accident claims. I mentioned it to him and he said he would honor the 25% rate. It is my first time getting a lawyer, so I was a bit antsy. But I figured I would be better without one. He will also recoup any legal fees he has while handling my case (I assume this is normal.) Nevertheless, what do you guys think? State: CA I think you need a signed retainer agreement with all of this laid out, including what you will be charged for costs like copies, faxes, etc. Ask when the statute of limitations deadline for filing a lawsuit is for this accident, and if the attorney expects that will be necessary. Also beware of any personal injury attorney who insists you see their preferred chiropractor. Insurance adjusters tend to view that as a way of pumping up your bills without justification. If you have health insurance, ask the attorney how subrogation is handled, and also if you can expect medical liens on your recovery. So far it seems that everything is going as it should. Just stay in contact with your attorney.
