I was living with a couple until September. They broke up and I told them I needed to leave the country in November. 2 of us wanted to leave but the remaining one didn't. I agreed to pay my 1/3 until l find someone and the one who wanted to stay agreed to pay 2/3. He knows that after 1st November, l won't have a valid visa anymore. 

I've been looking for someone to take my room for 2 months now. I left in early November but I am still actively looking for someone via kijiji. However, he cut off communication. He doesn't respond to any communication (phone, email and social media), he doesn't respond to potential renter, so no one have visit the apartment since I left.

I could barely pay my 1/3 of this month rent and the location office contacted me because he didn't pay his full part. I have no way to pay for next month rent and cannot have someone taking my room if there is no one to make the visit. I don't even know the state of my room and the apartment.

Is there a way for me to break the lease when I'm not even allow to come back in canada because of immigration issue?

If he cannot keep up with the rent, am I liable when I am literally on the other side of the world?

If I can find someone to take my room but he doesn't agree to someone moving in, do I still have to pay my part?

I'm feeling like an hostage and I'm also pretty pissed about the situation.

TL;DR: I pay the rent for a room on the other side of the world without living in and being unable to even step in that country again. Ex-roommate doesn't want to do visit, cannot keep up with the rent, block me and I still have to pay fore something I cannot afford.
