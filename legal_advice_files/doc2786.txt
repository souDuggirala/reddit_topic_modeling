 So as the title states, Uncle passed in N.J without any immediate family or relatives around. My father is in AZ, and his brother is in FL. We don't suspect that there is any life insurance. Is there a way to handle his remains completely out-of-state? The folks seem to think one of the brothers will have to fly there to claim the body and transport ashes if cremated. What are the options? Thanks so much for the help!
