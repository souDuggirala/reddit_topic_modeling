 I am trying to figure out how to get my outdated charge removed from Atlas Public Records. After I went through the court process, which took about eight months from the time of the arrest, my charge was significantly reduced. However, the original charge remains on their website. Their reasons listed for removing a charge are if it was expunged, sealed, or dismissed, which must be supported with documentation. I was wondering if having the charged reduced is a good enough reason for them to remove it, and if so, what supporting document(s) I would need to provide along with it. Thanks in advance! It's public record. You were in fact charged with that.
