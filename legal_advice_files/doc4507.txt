 I am from NW Ohio, stalker is from Chicagoland Illinois. I have an ongoing issue with a stalker for over a year. I filed a police report in August, they concluded it was telecommunications harassment, but I heard nothing about it and no updates since. She messaged me again and I finally went to my local court house to get a restraining order to prevent stalking, and they refused it. They told me to get an attorney for libel, and to deal with the rest on my own until she 'actually' physically threatens me. I don't know what to do. I can't afford an attorney, and this crazy woman gets to keep doing what shes doing.
