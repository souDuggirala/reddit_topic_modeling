 It just seems to make sense because I work at a place that isn't exactly kosher. I said something that might appear as antisemitic one night. The following day while I was working someone who looked like King Saul. They came into my work wearing a huge star of David gold necklace. Felt strange considering the only people that shop at my place are the poor. I don't actually know if he has a Jewish husband but they have seemed to be around more than usual. In my area they never were before. I hope to God I am delusional believe me! However this hasn't ended for years now. I'm a little tired right now and can't properly put all the weird occurrences that have happened to me in chronological order. It could be anyone not just Jewish people it could be the Russians. Now I just sound crazy so I'll stop. Stop posting this. We canâ€™t help you here.
