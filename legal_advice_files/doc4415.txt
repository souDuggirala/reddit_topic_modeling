 So I live in Iowa and I’m not sure what the laws are on this but I moved in to an apartment with my friend in March last year. Upon moving in the deposit was split, I paid 350 while she paid 200. Living with her wasn’t exactly easy. She made my life a living hell for 6 months to say the least. She decided she didn’t want to live here anymore so she broke her part of the lease and moved out leaving me with 1000 dollars in bills that I can barely afford. I cut all communication with her and haven’t talked to her since she moved out. Well the lease is up in March and my question is would it be illegal to keep her half of the deposit? I don’t even know where to begin on how to get ahold of her and I don’t know where she lives now.  Yes, it would be illegal to keep money that isn't yours. However, depending on how she left, you may be able to sue her for her part of rent, assuming you didn't get another roommate.
