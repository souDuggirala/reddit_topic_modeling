 Not sure if its appropriate for this sub but I've been wondering about what cyberbullying actually is and if its illegal. According to a bit of googling death threats fall into the category of cyberbullying. With this in mind is it possible to be arrested for telling someone on the internet to kill themselves or by simply saying "kys"?
