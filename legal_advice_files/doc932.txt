 In February 2017, I was charged with felonies in Illinois. At the time, I was on felony probation in Missouri. I was arrested in Missouri for a probation violation warrant as a result of my new charges and remained incarcerated there. In July 2017, I filed a Demand for Speedy Trial in the Illinois court. In August 2017, I was sentenced in Missouri and went to the Department of Corrections. I remained there until my parole date in December 2018. Illinois knew where I was the entire time I was there, yet made no effort to come get me and take my case to trial. Illinois waited until 2 weeks before my parole date to lodge a detainer, then extradited me after my release date. Can my case be dismissed based on them not coming to get me after I had filed the Speedy Trial Demand? Does anyone know of any similar cases that set a precedent regarding dismissal based on circumstances such as these? I know this is a unique situation but I would really appreciate any advice anyone may have. Thanks!
