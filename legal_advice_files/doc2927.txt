 Good morning all, using a throwaway because i usually only read Reddit, I don't comment. I need some advice on a recent incident. I was driving the other day and was approaching an intersection, it was a three lane road and i was in the middle. I put on my turn signal that i was going to turn left and then turned it off because I changed my mind. another car in the right lane must have seen my signal and decided to take my place in the middle lane. i think they were already beside me and didn't see my signal because they skipped off the side of me. We both stopped and took each others insurance down and waited for the cops. the cops showed up and took our statements but issued no citations because he said it couldn't be proved who was at fault. we went our separate ways and we each called our insurance. i had to speak with both my insurance and theirs and gave the same statement. i was informed today that the other driver is saying almost the same thing and that the insurance companies have to look at police reports now. They say they aren't assigning blame because we have both given similar statements. So here's the thing, there were no witnesses or cameras and since both of our police statements will say the same thing what are the chances of being sued? i am so distraught over this because i'm not in a place financially to pay my deductible AND get sued over this. I'm almost to the point i wish i had just said that it was all my fault, pay my deductible and get both of our cars fixed. If the insurance companies take our statements and look at the police reports and decided no blame can be assigned can these people still come after me? Should i call my insurance company and just say I want to take full blame? Should i wait this out? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you. If you get sued you have insurance to deal with it. They provide the lawyer and defend you. It's not immediately on your dime. Don't worry about it, too much.
