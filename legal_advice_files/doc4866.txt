 Just looking for some advice or where to go with this really. Also not sure if this is a breach of GDPR or not... My partner applied for a job at a walk-in centre recently after moving to the area. She didn’t end up getting a job there and found one elsewhere. About a month later she was speaking to her mother who told her that her grandmother had been asking about my partner applying. Her mother asked how she knew and her grandmother explained that my partners uncle had been to the walk-in centre, he’s a regular in there, and had been chatting to a nurse who told him she had seen my partners application and asked him if he knew she had applied. There are definitely things I can see wrong with this whole situation. First the nurse shouldn’t have had access to applications, and second if she did she shouldn’t be talking to anyone about them. For all they know my partner may have been trying to distance themself from her family. We have sent an email of complaint to the walk-in department and have had a response saying it is being investigated and we will hear back however I’m not sure where to go with this really. Any advice would be great! TL:DR - details of my partner’s job application were told to her uncle by a nurse. Both had no reason to know/speak about it.  Try /r/legaladviceuk
