 My washing machine stopped working a week ago. It wouldn’t drain and my clothes, towels, and half my bedding has been inside ever since. I’ve tried getting them out but the water is ice cold, deep, and the clothes are all twisted together making it near impossible. Anyway, my landlord told me to call his handyman. Handyman came out and didn’t know what was wrong, and said he’d have to come back the next night. Next night I get home late from work and he says he doesn’t have time, totally fine. I got to talking with my coworkers about him and they had awful things to say- that my coworker hired him to fix her roof and he took the money and ran, sexual abuse allegations, etc. I’m 23F and live alone and now I’m nervous to be alone with him. I expressed my concerns to my landlord and he basically said, “Oh no he’s a nice guy! He wouldn’t do that.” But I’m still nervous. He has no-showed the last 2 times he’s been scheduled to come. Landlord said he wouldn’t foot the bill if I hired anyone else. Can he do that? Unfortunately no. You do not have have the right to choose a repairperson unless you are willing to pat for it yourself. The lankford myst have things repaired in a reasonable timeframe, but does not have a duty to let you choose by whom.  If your lease says you can, then you can. If it doesn't say, and the landlord is paying, he can pay whomever he wants.
