 R/UKlegaladvice I'm not familiar with UK laws, but in US/Canada, just because you cancel your payment method doesn't mean you are not still liable. You could absolutely be sued and take a credit hit and possible wage garnishment. /r/LegalAdviceUK Not in the UK, but in the US this is not a legitimate means of canceling a contract, provided that the contract has been agreed to by all parties. And here yes you might go to court but (perhaps) more likely it would go to collections and ding credit. I don't imagine that the UK is different. Probably. Removing the payment doesn't cancel the contract. It just means you haven't paid. You can expect your balance to be sent to collections and reported on your credit.
