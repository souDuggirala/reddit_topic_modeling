 We broke up and she left with my daughter and is basically not letting me see her. She's always claiming to be out of town or comes up with really crappy excuses every time i ask. She refuses to schedule anything. I wrote up a proposed schedule that she rejected and offered no alternative and pretty much ignored. I also told her that she has 0 legal right to do what shes doing. I live in ontario by the way. I know this probably gets posted a lot but i'm hoping to get some advice. Evidently lawyers are in the near future.
