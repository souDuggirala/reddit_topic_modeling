In Missouri caught the neighbor molesting little sister and taking inappropriate pictures.  Beat him up pretty bad and now facing first degree assault charges.  Cannot afford a lawyer and apparently don't qualify for public defender. They have proof of what he was doing.  What can be done?  Legal advice or help finding an affordable attorney would be great.In Missouri caught the neighbor molesting little sister and taking inappropriate pictures.

If you took the law into your own hands that's something else entirely.  You need to actually apply for a public defender if you have not done so already. Otherwise beg and borrow the money for an attorney if you want the best possible outcome.  You need an attorney. If you have to borrow money, that's what you do. You can find an attorney you can afford. *Any* attorney is better than no attorney. Use the [Missouri Bar Lawyer Referral Service](http://www.mobar.org/forthepublic/findalawyer.htm) to find lawyers in your area. There are lawyers that will work on payment plans. 

Personal feelings aside of *who* you assaulted and why you did it, you assaulted someone. You're guilty of a crime. You need to act accordingly. That means speaking to no one about it and getting a lawyer by following the advice I gave above.  [removed]
