 Backstory: Driving home from work. Pickup pulled out in front of me. T boned them. My car totaled. They were uninsured. At the current time I did not have uninsured motorist property damage on my policy ( I do now), I only had the injury portion. My insurance has already found them at fault be cause they made a fraudulent claim against me saying it was my fault. Next step as I understand is to sue in small claims court. Now to today: I have gotten the total loss evaluation back from my insurance and am ready to move on. I am looking for advise on how to move forward with the suit in a way to not loose am much mo way and time as it is worth. This is a first for me and my parents, whose car it technically still was. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.  On the Insurance for the truck, which is assumed to be her dad, she was excluded. And her insurance on her own car denied because she wasn’t in her car in the accident.  If the girl was a permissive driver of the truck, the truck's owner's insurance should cover unless she was specifically excluded. And her insurance should cover her for any car she drives. Your parents should sue both her and the owner Ok. I agree but there’s a little more to it. The girl driving had insurance. The truck had insurance. But neither were covered together in that combination so that’s why I said there was no insurance. Still, thank you for the input.  Your parents can sue the other driver for the value of the car. There is a good chance that, if he doesn't have insurance, he doesn't have any money to pay a judgment either.
