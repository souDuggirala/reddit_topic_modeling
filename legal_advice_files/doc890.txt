 Case: []() I'd like to mention that this is a debt collection agency. The debt was accrued by a family member who asked me to sign this loan for them; but that isn't really the main issue here. I plan to call this agency directly, and settle the debt; asking said family member to pay, of course. At what stage is this case at? I am the defendant. Am I required to go to this "Future hearing" on 8/26/2019? Thank you in advance.  It's certainly better than a default judgment. It seems that I've already missed the window to file my "answer". Will attempting to call the collection agency to negotiate a settlement be a viable option? Thank you for your previous reply! That future date is automatic -- it's a tickler in the file in case no progress has been made on the case. The docket says you've been served. If you do nothing, a default will probably be filed against you, which will be granted if you do nothing. The plaintiff can then move to collect the judgment.
