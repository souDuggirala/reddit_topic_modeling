 [Illinois] As the title says, my dad says I am not allowed to drive and my mom says she doesnâ€™t care if I drive. The title is in both of their names. If my dad calls the police and reports the car as stolen while I am driving it, what would the police do in this situation?  It depends on if your dad lies. If he explains that his son stole it with the keys provided by the owner (your mom) they will tell him to have a good night and leave. If he lies, you may get pulled over and pulled out of the car until you show them the keys and explain mom let you drive her car.
