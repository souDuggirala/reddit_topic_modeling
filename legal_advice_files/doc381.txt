 My neighbor has set up some kind of exhaust hose that is insanely loud and causing me migraines and my partner cannot sleep. I don't know what the purpose of it is, or if he should be running it during certain hours? Or if I have no cause for complaint. Noise ordinance can vary by city, but usually tries to protect you from things like this. Call the police non-emergency line and file a complaint. Depending on the area and exact circumstances, this may resolve the problem. I've done this several times before in a college setting in a faraway state (it's like no one cared they had a dozen other apartments could hear them past midnight), and the police always resolved it in about 20 minutes, every time. Hopefully someone else can say what to do if calling the police doesn't work.
