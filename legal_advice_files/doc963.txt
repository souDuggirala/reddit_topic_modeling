 I would appreciate advice as to how I could grant my sister in law and brother in law the right to make large decisions (if need be) about my children (age 2 and 4) while they serve as temporary guardians. These relatives are kin to the children's father, who has been incarcerated and we three (my children and myself) have a two year no contact protective order from. My CPS case arose after I struggled to ensure a stable living situation immediately following an attack by their father on us this past summer. My case has been ongoing and has no court orders. Since the beginning of my case there are a lot of legal questions within the realm of my situation that I have been able to research and get answers for, and I am reluctant to pose any legal questions about my case as I am more confident that I need a lawyer should CPS take me to court. I am following a safety plan and engaging in services, documenting everything, etc. I just need to pick up the pace with addressing some of the risk factor concerns and showing initiative for family partnership. I am looking for answers in how to legally grant my in-laws a permission for emergency situations. This detail was brought up when discussing timelines for my safety plan and upcoming decisions for the case. I was told that they'd have to be "foster parents" or to apply for custody should they want the ability (for instance) to make important life or death decisions without my immediate consent. Caseworker said she has seen some bad situations where a child has appendicitis (for example) and the temporary guardians can't make decisions bc the legal custodian is not able to be there or to give consent. I am confused by this and am looking for clarification. I have found the “Health Care Decisions Act” Code of Virginia and am sure this has something to do with what she is saying but need help understanding. Thank you!
