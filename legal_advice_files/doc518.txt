 Yes, that's completely correct. I confronted him last night about it and he swears up and down he'll go with me, or do it online (it's been a while since I had to do it) to file for a list title. I'm seriously doubting it but I really need this vehicle. I have an offer on it that would be enough to by a decent car my parents are willing to sell me.  I think you’re saying you loaned him $300 and the truck title was collateral for the loan. Is this correct? Is he refusing to pay back the $300? If so, threaten to take him to small claims court, and if he still doesn’t pay up, then carry through.   's next to no proof except for what my Mom and I say happened. Thanks for taking the time to respond. Yes.  [removed] Sue him in small claims court.
