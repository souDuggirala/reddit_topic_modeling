 I'm a long time lurker, and I just wanted to make this post to thank Legaladvice for its existence. If I hadn't read all the stories here, I wouldn't have known what to do on the scariest day in my life, the day the cops showed up with a search warrant and took my stuff. \- I said nothing \- I did not immediately go to the station for questioning like they wanted me to \- I instead went directly to a criminal defense lawyer and got advice \- I knew I was innocent and he gave me the advice I needed to safely interview (he suggested this after I explained to him what I thought was going on) \- He didn't even make me pay \- I interviewed with the police with my counsel \- The police closed the investigation and I got my stuff back So, this was definitely an absolute fucking nightmare, and I'm still sort of scarred by it, but....at least everything was ok. So, thank you legal advice for existing and at least giving me the fundamentals I needed to protect myself and not have my life ruined over something that wasn't my fault.
