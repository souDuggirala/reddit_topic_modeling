 I am traveling to SoCal for work, and have a USB charger hidden cam. Can I legally place that in my hotel room to monitor my valuables while I am away? Obviously I will not leave valuables out in the room, but prefer to be safe. Donâ€™t want to violate any laws. Thanks in advance.  Legally yes, for all intents and purposes you are renting that room so you are the proprietor over it [deleted] I actually saw an ad for these the other day. Pretty discrete. Here is the link: [USB Charger Hidden Camera]() Generally speaking, with no specific knowledge of CA law, I would say that's fine. I can't see anyone other than you having any expectation of privacy in your hotel room while you are not present.
