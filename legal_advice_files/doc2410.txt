 I am interested in purchasing a smart doorbell with a camera. The doorbell would come with features such as showing me, live, whos at the door through my phone, and video/picture storage. Ofcourse I have a neughbours door right across from mine. Would this cause any legal issues as the camera would be in the hallway pretty much facing her door. Possibly may be able to see the elevator landing as well considering I am right beside the elevator. I would speak to your neighbor as well as the landlord. I would explain to the neighbor what you are thinking about doing and ask for feedback on how they feel about it. In addition, you need to make sure you are allowed to have such a device in your hallway under the rules of your apartment building. Assuming your apartment is ok with it, it really doesn't matter what your neighbor thinks. But it is always better to try to at least broach the subject with the neighbor and see if you can avoid trouble.  Appreciate the advice. Thanks! It's possible that your neighbour might complain to the landlord about it, but it's a stretch that you could be evicted over it if you promptly restore the original doorbell. You can easily resolve this by talking to your neighbour before you point a camera at their door.
