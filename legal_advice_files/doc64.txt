 Cops broke into my house today supposedly on a call to which they got the wrong address. They broke my front door and I only noticed after they were breaking the door down. I asked for a police report to which I will get it tomorrow and will file a claim for compensation tomorrow at city hall over this ordeal. Is there anything else I should do? State:Oklahoma I won't be able to check right away due to work but any help will be appreciated. Theyâ€™ll pay for your damages. If you feel some kind of legitimate mental anguish or PTSD, see a doctor and talk to a lawyer. It would be a mistake and if they fix your door you've been made whole. So what would it be then? Not sarcasm, I honestly don't know. Compensation for the damage is all I want.  But in general terms, being compensated for the damage would conclude this matter. That wasn't necessarily an "illegal break in" depending on the circumstances.
