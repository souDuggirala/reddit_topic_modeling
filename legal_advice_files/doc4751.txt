 I found out there was a bomb threat at my work from the news while I was still there. The building was not evacuated and we received no notice, warning, heads up - nothing. Is this legal? [removed] This could have gone the other way. But it didn't. So you have no claim. There are thousands of possible alternative things that might have happened. Ultimately, the only one that matters is what did happen.  It is not illegal based on the facts in your post, assuming USA. There could be many reasons why the building was not evacuated.
