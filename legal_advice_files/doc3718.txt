 Earlier today I got an email that someone registered a new Uber account using my Gmail. I initially thought it was a phishing attempt since the registration email didn't provide a link to deregister. I decided later to visit the Uber website on my own - not throught the email. When I tried to create an account with my Gmail it was rejected because "it's already used". So I used the option to retrieve my password and gain access to the account. So it seemed the account is registered to some guy in Sweden with a first name similar to mine. I tried to delete the account but apparently Uber doesn't provide such an option or I couldn't find it. Busy with work I let it be. Now I just got an email informing me about my last Uber ride that was charged on some credit card. Apparently the dude still has access to this account although I changed the password and also connected his credit card with it. What should I do? Please help! Been there with my cell number a few years ago. Contact Uber customer service and explain. They will fix it. Contact Uber. It's not a big deal.  You should first stop breaking into other people's accounts. That Uber account is not yours and your attempts to recover it are illegal. Second, you can reach out to Uber customer service and explain the issue, if you want. This doesn't really affect you at all, so there's nothing else to be done. Try calling customer service. Iâ€™m sure there is something that can be done through them.  Email Uber, this isn't a legal problem.
