 Currently looking at an apartment complex in Portland, OR the lease says a few things that the landlord has contradicted. The lease states a limit on the amount of people allowed on the balcony, prohibited BBQs and limits on the amount of furniture allowed on the balconies. The leasing office in person and over email contradicted what the lease stated(allowing BBQs and saying the limits were different due to the size of the space). They said that the lease is generic for all of the properties they manage and I would not have any issues. I believe them since it's one of the larger companies but my concern is if I sign the lease and they go back on what they said and enforce the signed document, could the emails be used to nullify the lease? Cross out those parts of the lease, sign it, make a copy and return it with the copies of the emails.  The lease governs. What they say holds no water, no weight, and is legally not enforceable.  Ask them to change the wording in the lease...
