 I work in Healthcare. A new resident moved in and requested no men and no homosexuals. They have sense moved staff to accommodate that request. We also had another resident call a staff member a f@ot and had them removed from their care duties. Is this considered a hostile work environment? When brought to upper management they said they didn't know. It was quickly pointed out that admissions came to us and warned us the resident didn't like any lgbtq staff. So then they said they were too easily offended. One more question I know there is religious freedom to refuse services but is it ok to start say a fb page that names businesses that don't support lgbtq married couple for insurance and are known for hostile work environments just so the community is aware?  They can't force any kind of treatment if thr patient doesn't want no matter how ridiculous the reason might be. Their only other option is to deny service altogether, which has its risks particularly in Healthcare. I'm not sure you can choose based on who they have sex with as it is none of their business. Work shouldn't disclose that and by making people move they are announcing their sexuality. Shouldn't work tell them they don't discriminate with their employees?  The patient can choose who works on them.  Hostile Work Environment is a legal term of art and contrary to popular belief, it does not mean that the workplace was hostile in the colloquial sense. Rather, it refers to a pattern of discrimination or harassment as a result of an employee's membership in a protected class. Please see [this link from the EEOC](http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/harassment.cfm) to better understand the advice you may receive. The majority of situations that many consider a hostile work environment do not meet that definition legally. I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
