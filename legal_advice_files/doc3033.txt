 I got a prescription filled. The label was correct, but it turns out the pills inside were wrong. I took them for 4 days and eventually figured it out because I felt like total shit (dizzy, anxious, couldn't sleep). My doctor said there won't be any lasting damage. In the scheme of things it's not a big deal but I'm wondering if I can get compensated for this pain and suffering. NAL, pharmacist... you would probably get a more satisfying response if you contacted the state board of pharmacy. They investigate stuff like this. They dont award you anything if youre right, but misfills generally at least receive some administrative action, sometimes fines. Rein it in. Now.  [removed] [removed] Well, I definitely suffered. Anyway, I called up a local attorney and he thinks it is worth a discussion with them. He will do it on contingency. Apparently he has reached minor settlements in cases like this before. Thanks everyone! [removed] Fair enough  Pain and sufferung is extremely difficult to quantify into a monetary value and because of that, damages for pain and suffering are not frequently rewarded to people who didn't also suffer from serious injuries and have extremely high medical bills, or are suing on behalf of someone who died. And there's no legal avenue to sue for what might have happened but did not. The person you're responding to is being sarcastic. That's not a serious emoji there, and mental anguish doesn't apply here.  Sue em Yeah, there is that, too. It was a nasty few days. What pain and suffering? The kind you didn't suffer? No. You cannot sue for anything here, you have no damages.
