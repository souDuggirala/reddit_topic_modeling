 (Colorado) I'm sure my post history makes it clear why I'm asking. I tried Googling the question but have had no luck. Anyone know? You can't arrest and charge someone who is dead. So suicide can't be illegal. Once you do it, you're beyond mortal law. But attempted suicide will get you involuntarily committed to receive mental health treatment, and assisting someone else in suicide is illegal in most places in the US.
