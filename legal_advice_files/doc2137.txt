 Like the title says, I am not sure if this is a HIPPA violation. My husband and I go so the same health care facility as his parents. We also live in the same house, so the address is the same. However, we do not share an account with them. And his mother does not have the same last name as him. My MIL was picking up her prescription and the pharmacist mention my husband had one he needed to pick up. The pharmacist asked if she wanted to take it home And the answer was no. He did not want this prescription has he had told the pharmacy the day before. While this isn’t a big thing, I just feel like this isn’t right. She should not have the ability to pick up our prescription. We pay two separate bills and our account are completely separate. I am not sure if this is a true violation or if I am just being sensitive. My real question is, is this a HIPPA violation? Should this be something that I mention to my heath care provider, even if it is not?  You don't seem to understand the issue. The pharmacist can't just volunteer to anyone who walks in that Bob Smith's prescription is available. They have never gone in together, but that makes sense if they did. Thanks! You solved my question in less than five minutes. :) If your husband and MIL sometimes come to the pharmacy together or your husband otherwise indicated that she is involved in his care, the disclosure would likely be OK. Regardless, you can report it to the pharmacy or to HHS. Mentioning it to your doctor won't accomplish anything.  She did not ask for his prescription. She had no idea he had one. the healthcare provider has multiple departments, so you can instantly leave your appointment and get the prescription from their pharmacy. Anyone can pick up a prescription for you. Doesn’t have to be related. This is common practice
