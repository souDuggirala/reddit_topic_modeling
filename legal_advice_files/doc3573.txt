 He wrote me for passing an emergency vehicle which I’ve read is a class 1 misdemeanor. Should I be getting a lawyer? Please help! Well shit. The cop was stopped so I think I would count for a fine or penalty. Either way, I guess I feel better having a lawyer. Better safe than sorry right? It's only Class 1 if the emergency vehicle was moving. Otherwise it is an infraction, which is not a criminal offense and only has a fine for a penalty. [deleted] [removed] You are only entitled to a court-provided lawyer if you are facing jail time. I believe the maximum punishment for VA 46.2-829 is a $500 fine so you wouldn't qualify for one. Beg or borrow the money. In the end, not getting a lawyer may be the more costly option. If you're facing potential jail time, you can request a public defender and will be assigned one if you meet the income requirements. If your charges don't threaten jail, though, you have no right to a lawyer unless you pay for one yourself. What you should do is look up your exact charges and find the source law to determine how serious they are. There’s no way I can afford a lawyer, don’t I have a right to one somehow? [removed]
