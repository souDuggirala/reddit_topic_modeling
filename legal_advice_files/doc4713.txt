 I keep getting calls from different numbers saying that they are from the irs and I need to get back to them immediately or the local police will come and take me into custody. It’s a phishing scam right? Just making sure Yep. I also got one recently in Aus. Poor English, incorrect Department names, threats of arrest etc.  Yes. It is a scam. The real IRS will send you a letter. To a certain extent. Your number might be active but you’re no money to them. You actually take up their time and they block your number after 20+ calls. Your number may or may not be resold. I barely get cold calls anymore. Maybe 1-2 every week. While it is fun to mess with them, it's probably better to just ignore it. Answering just confirms that your number is active and they'll keep calling.  FWIW, tax scammers have started contacting people by mail up here in Canada.  It’s a scam, but a downright fun one! Pretend to be scared and give them fake information. (Google Fake Name Generators) I used to get cold calls all the time from a variety of scammers. Given my job, I have time on my hands to waste as much of their time as I possible can. Every minute they spend with me is a minute they’re not working on some poor soul. Have some fun with it, offer to pay them thousands of dollars and ask if you can write a check, or if they accept some unknown currency. I don’t get as many cold calls anymore, this saddens me. :( Your best bet is to go all jerky boys on them This is a scam. The IRS does not contact you by phone. They do so by mail. Absolutely a scam. If you call them back its usually a thick Indian accent.  Scam. Irs won’t threaten police involvement Yes, it's a scam. The IRS will never call you. Def a scam. Look up on youtube.
