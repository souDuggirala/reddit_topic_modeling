 Hello I am currently 17 but turn 18 in just a few weeks, my parents have said that i am no longer allowed to use their utilities and if Iâ€™d like to use them i must pay for them. This includes water, electric, and even in one text food. Is this legal? I live in Florida it this helps.  And before he is 18, they can take every penny he makes.  While you are still a minor, your parents must provide food and shelter, including utilities, but they are allowed to control your earnings. When you are a legal adult, your parents have no obligation to house or feed you, but they must give you proper notice before they evict you and they cannot turn off the utilities as this is a constructive eviction. They don't need to feed you, though. No it most certainly is not legal. Tell a school counselor and if they attempt to enforce this just call CPS yourself. Edit: to be clear, it's on its face illegal for the next few weeks. After that, it's basically constructive eviction. They can't tell you that youre cut off from utilities, but once you're 18 they can evict you for not helping pay for them.
