I was misdiagnosed with a chronic, life threatening autoimmune disorder in 2016. I went to a new doctor a couple of weeks ago and he said I was completely misdiagnosed, I had an infection not the autoimmune disorder. The previous doctor put me on very expensive medicine, and I got sick to my stomach from it constantly. I had to worry about everything I ate, and had to worry about if I was going to die from it (20f, now 22f). I live in Texas. Is there any way this could be a case? I'm so upset that I was misdiagnosed and the doctor so easily put me on this horribly expensive medicine. Medical malpractice is way too fact-specific and beyond the scope of this sub.  Your only real, feasible option is to consult with an IRL medical malpractice attorney. Med mal is incredibly fact specific and beyond the scope of this sub.

If you want to pursue anything you should talk to a real, in person attorney.
