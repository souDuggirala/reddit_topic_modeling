 I was home, the doorbell rang, someone with a badge was trying to give court summons to my fiancé. To mine and her knowledge, she hasn’t done anything illegal. Why could this be happening?

[removed] When you get the summons, you'll know what it's about- we can't guess. Ah fair enough, well let them serve her- dodging them really wont help as at somepoint the sheriff will do the serving (at least where I live - I don't see a location in your post). Then read the summons and go from there and decide if you need a lawyer I tried, but they wouldn’t leave it with me since my fiancé wasn’t home  I don’t know, my fiancé isnt home so they wouldn’t leave it with me  Did you accept the summons? It should have some information on it that would clear up these questions. What does the summons say on it? She's a witness. Someone thinks she is a witness. Someone things she did a crime. Etc. Regardless, chat with a lawyer before speaking with police/lawyers.
