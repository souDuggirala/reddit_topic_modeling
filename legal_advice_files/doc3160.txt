 Someone suggested that I post here. Do you need to provide a social security number to someone if they want to add you to their trust? My husband's aunt by marriage pulled him to the side and quietly asked him for his social security number and didn't provide a reason for why she was asking for it. I ask the reason why and she became very defensive about it and snapped at me saying it was to place him on her trust. The whole thing doesn't make very much sense to me because she has her own children to care for and who would be a priority to place on a trust and not us. Also they don't have a lot of money and my husband isn't all that close to her and she hasn't been that particularly kind to him either, so because of all of this and the way she snapped at me for asking why she needed it has sent alarm bells off in my head. He hasn't provided it to her but I know her personality and she will probably be persistent.  Yes, you need a social security number to add someone to a trust. Honestly, you have no idea how much money they have. Just because they don't spend it doesn't mean that it isn't tucked away in trusts and accounts. Maybe their children are already handled, maybe they like your husband more.
