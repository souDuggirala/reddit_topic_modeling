 Today my nephew who is 5 years old kicked his mother and she kicked him back. Not extremely hard but enough to cause pain and tears. She proceeded to call him a brat and freak out saying he's always like this after staying at our Dad's house. There have been plenty of other things she has done that are neglectful or that are a reason to be concerned. Is there anything that can be done without getting my nephew and his brothers from her? I'm his godfather so I don't know it that changes anything if she was deemed an unfit parent. His two other brothers don't have these issues with their mother.  If you contact CPS they will not necessarily take the children away, they will instead likely do a home visit and an interview and try to come up with some sort of safety plan. To be honest this may be more of a moral question for you than a legal one - do you think those children should be left with someone who physically mistreats them? Your being the godfather has no legal bearing, that's a religious thing not a legal thing.
