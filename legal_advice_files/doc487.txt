 It was parked on a residential street. Iâ€™m pretty sure j have an idea of who did it since where i parked it i was the first car there. I left it parked for two days.i go out this morning and its all scratched and a couple dents on the rear bumper from so huge white truck that parked behind me. How would i go about getting the damage fixed? Should i check the truck behind me to see of there is any proof? How would i go about this? Any advice helps.  File a claim with your insurance. Explain what happened, provide photos if requested, and let them handle it. It's usually very difficult to prove who hit your car just by matching up scratches. Without a confession, an eyewitness, or video evidence, then you can't just accuse someone you think it was. If the damage is severe enough, and you have collision insurance, you could file a claim against that.
