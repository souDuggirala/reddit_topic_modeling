My wife and I are currently renting in Colorado and are having some landlord issues. Our neighbors have told us that they have seen our landlord enter the property while we are at work and our landlord has never notified us of entry. Per the lease agreement she has to give us 24hrs notice prior to entering the property. We moved out last week but our lease is not up till later this month and our landlord won't move up the walk through. Is there any recourse we can take if we find out that she has entered the home without letting us know now that we have moved out? Our lease is still current and rent has been paid through the end of the lease. My lease is still current for a couple of weeks, I’m trying to figure out if she enters the property without giving me proper notice if there is anything I can do to, say, void the lease and make sure I get my deposit back. She’s has been known with the last couple of tenants to keep the security deposit without the proper documentation as to why. What kind of recourse are you looking for?  You aren’t specifying any damages, and you are no longer a tenant.
