 Keeping it a bit vague just in case. I work for a fairly large outsourcing company (like a contractor, but with some differences). I've been employed there for a few years now, my reviews and performance there have always been above average/excellent. I was assigned a project which involved working locally on the site of a customer. After over a year of working on the assignment, the customer's company wanted to hire me directly (which would almost double my salary, we are generally underpaid and I'm at the bottom of that chart too). The contract between my employer and their customer stipulates that I cannot be hired by the customer directly for many years unless a buyout for a huge sum of money is done. The buyout price is unreasonable, it is many times more than my yearly salary. Meanwhile we have a much larger customer with the same contract stipulations. It is very common for this larger customer to hire my colleagues. So common in fact that in the year I was gone, more than half of my original team (size of the team is less than 10 people) has made this switch. None of them have encountered similar issues with the agreement. So the real question is: how can I get fairly compensated for doing my job? I love what I do, and I put my heart into the work that I do. I feel appreciated and valued on daily basis (mostly thanks to many amazing colleagues), but unfortunately it does not pay my many bills. Thank you very much for your advise in advance. Check with an employment law attorney if it is over burdensome many times itâ€™s not enforceable.
