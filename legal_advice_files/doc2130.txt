 Hello,I am making this post for my soon to be Fiancee,I am looking for the easiest method to help her get started on the immigration process,As a college student,I am not very wealthy and I know if the application is denied you lose your over $1000 USD you put into it,I have no idea the prices for a immigrant attorney,Would be going the way of fiancee be the best or would it be better for her to apply as a student,I am not skilled in law and am looking for any help,would anything else be better than these two I listed or no and if so what would be better?Please help. The US government puts out the pamphlet: [I am a U.S. citizen: How do I help my fianc√©\(e\) become a U.S. permanent resident? \(PDF\)]() I am a natural born U.S citizen,thank you,I will look into this! Are you a US citizen, a green card holder, or in the US on some other status? You will almost certainly have to have sign an [affidavit of support]() to get her a green card. If you do not make $25,975 a year, you will have to combine the incomes and assets of your relatives to meet the minimum income requirements.
