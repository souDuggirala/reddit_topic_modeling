 We were wondering if this was sue able or arrest worthy If the neighbor was on their property; no. But, this will depend on what state you live in. Thanks  This sounds like it would qualify as a negligent carry of a firearm. North Carolina, United States  Where? They can report the neighbor to the police for brandishing a weapon but what would they sue for exactly?
