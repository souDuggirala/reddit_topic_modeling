 Yesterday, I made a campaign contribution that I would like to refund. How do I go about doing this? It's not illegal to ask for a refund.  Sure, it's not illegal to request, but they don't have to comply. You can request anything you want. The likelihood of them giving it to you is the question. Contact the person/group/website/etc that you made the contribution to and ask for a refund.
