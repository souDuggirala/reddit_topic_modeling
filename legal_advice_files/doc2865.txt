 I live in Illinois. I have a documented medical condition. I was in the process of applying for short term disability when my work environment became so hostile I felt I had to quit. The stress was so bad that it was greatly exacerbating my health condition. I believe there's nothing I can do about this, just confirming. Do I have any grounds to claim my resignation was involuntary? Do I have any grounds to claim my short term disability through my medical insurance that will be continued through COBRA? Management kept asking me to do work in a way that went against the reasonable accommodations that I asked for and they agreed to. I was constantly put into meetings to "checkin" on me, weekly, and the meetings were always triggered by me taking the accommodation that was offered to me. I have nothing in writing, I have no access to my old work email. I was in a mentally and physically very unhealthy place when I resigned. Was hard to make a good decision, and in hindsight it was a bad decision. I believe I have no legal grounds here, just confirming. How did the workplace become hostile?
