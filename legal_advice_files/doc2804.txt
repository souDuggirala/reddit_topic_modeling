 Hello, my former employer owes me around $13,000 in reimbursements and $2,500 in wages. The owner has since laid me off citing financial trouble and has gone radio silent about the reimbursement. Is there any course of action I can take to recover those funds or am I out of luck? I am located in North Carolina Ok thank you so much for the information. I’d rather be able to get some of the money than none of it. I’ll look into small claims.  Small claims court limits in NC vary by county, anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000, so if you're willing to take a slight haircut, you could forego much of the cost of an attorney and use small claims court. Unfortunately, you can't split a single amount owed into multiple small claims suits, so the max you could recover that way is $5k or $10k, depending on where you are. Am I correct in assuming that a lawsuit would cost close to what I am seeking anyway? File a [wage claim](). Your reimbursements might not be able to be included in that claim -- if not, you'd generally need to sue them for that portion. Not that I’m aware of, he has multiple businesses that are operational including the one I worked for which is still operational and profitable.  Has he filed for bankruptcy?
