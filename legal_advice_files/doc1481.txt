 Theft is theft. You'll probably be asked for a receipt and/or some proof that you had $100 worth at the time. You'll also want to be familiar with your country and local jurisdiction's rules involving mj. For example, you wouldn't want to call the police if someone stole 3 ounces of weed from you -- if your local jurisdiction doesn't allow a person to possess more than 1 ounce of weed - as an example.
