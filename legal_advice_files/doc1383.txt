 Hello so not sure if I’m in the right sub but here is the story. My mom and her friend went to Walmart to but tomatoes and supplies for our business (silk flowers). Well my mom tried going to self checkout cause she feels bad having to make a cashier ring it al up. Well all the lines at the self checkout were closed so she moves to the next closest. It happens to be the express lane (15 items of less or 20?). My mom didn’t even realize until the cashier made a comment and my mom apologized. The cashier didn’t ask her to move over or anything just continued. My mom and her friend continue having their conversations and helping her count the items (in Arabic). Well she finished and left with her $300 bill. (Should be $150). My mom when she gets home and has her friend and my sister look at it and they find a charge for 10 units of something. She only bought 38 of a flower and tomatoes. Well she goes back to the store and speaks to a manager. Manager claims that she had no idea what the item that was charged was and very surprised and upset about the employees actions. She refunded the money but now I look up the item code and find out it is propane tanks!? The employee charged my mom for 10 propane tanks (didn’t leave with any- never asked for any) and I believe it was to spite her or racially motivated. What can I do to make sure the employee gets held accountable? Should I reach out to news outlets? What can I do to make Walmart understand how horrible this situation was had my mom not double checked her receipt? I'm having a hard time seeing how you ring up flowers and accidentally ring up 10 propane tanks... I guess you could make a fuss with a manager? There is nothing to do legally here OP. This girl didn’t just press a wrong button. She charged 10 of these. Something that is under a lock and key and needs a manager to unlock after purchase.  Wait so your mom got a refund? People make mistakes OP. There is nothing to do here.
