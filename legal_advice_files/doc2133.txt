 Hello, so my story goes that is such â€“ I was driving on my local highway which is marked at 65 mph and there was a car behind me in the middle lane. I was in the left lane of three. There was a speed zone ahead changing the speed limit from 65 miles an hour to 55 miles an hour and I had to get into the right hand lane from the left side. The car that was in the middle lane was going about 75 in the 65 and 55, still going 65 in the 55 I moved over with the car behind me about 100 to 150 yards. He flashed me with his highbeams multiple times and sped around me. About 1 mile up the road there is a fork two lanes go left and two lanes go right. I was in the second to last plane going right at the fork and he was in the second lane going left at the fork. At this point I was driving with my windows down and making no aggressive actions towards the other driver, and he threw something that has yet to be identified at the side of my vehicle. I immediately got into his lane and called 911 and reported the issue as it happened. I later drove to the police station to report the incident as the dispatcher had advise me too. The officer I spoke to said that there was not sufficient damage to my vehicle to press charges, but there is a dent in my door from whatever he threw at me. Again, the other vehicle was identified through the license plate and description of the driver. My question for you guys is if I would have a case to file a small claim against the other driver? That's what we need. State or province. Without revealing my specific location what would location have to do with a law suit? I am in Western New York.  (NAL) As with almost all cases, location is important here. Can't do much without that, along with assessment of damage and a quote to fix it. Those should be your first concern here.
