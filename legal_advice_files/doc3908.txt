 After being stuck in bed for almost a month and a half, my husband had his second discectomy on 11/7. We went to an in-network surgical center with an in-network doctor and had the required procedure. Apparently, the doctor had a physician's assistant help him in the surgery. I wasn't aware of this, but even if I had been, I don't think it would have raised any flags. After all, the surgery was approved and the facility and the doctor. Now, the insurance company is claiming that our policy doesn't cover physician's assistants if they help with surgery! So evidently the expectation is for the patient or patient advocate to interview everyone who steps into the surgical suite? Seriously? How is this even remotely okay? They stated that I could repeal it, but I don't know what that accomplishes if our crazy policy states that. Any recommendations, or am I really stuck with a $1,500.00 bill that doesn't even count toward our yearly out of pocket? Have they sent you a letter with instructional on how to appeal their decision not to cover you?
