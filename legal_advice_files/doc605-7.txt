I was messing around in photoshop and ended up making something that my friends thought looked pretty cool.

However, the photo I made was a conglomerate of 4k photos of water, space, etc. that I got from google images. The images I used are most likely copyrighted. You cannot tell from the image that I made, that I used these photos since I "transformed" them so much. 

My friend suggested I sell it (I probably won't sell this one) but would I be legally able to do that? 

(I live in Ohio, U.S.A,  but I'm pretty sure Copyright Laws are a national issue) Lol, I'll probably just play it safe and try and use my own photos (I have a drone that I can take photos of the sunset and clouds with, which will get me a similar outcome). Thank you for your input!
 Hmmmm. Honestly you might be able to get away with it. I could not tell where a lot of the source images were in your picture. You could probably convince a judge that this is different enough. 

The catch being, of course, you would have to actually go to court, which is its own hassle.  I’m just nosy but I loved this one (I’m a music teacher). I’d be interested in one.  Here are the photos I used to create the final product:

The test that I like to use when determining if something has been sufficiently "transformed" is seeing if the transformed version could be used as a substitute for the original. 

Photos of water and space are tricky. I'm not sure how you could sufficiently transform a photo of water or space. I would have to compare whatever you made with the original photos. 

For right now I would hold off on selling it.  [deleted]
