 Disclaimer: My brother is in this situation, not me, but I’m seeking advice on his behalf. My brother signed a month to month lease, but the woman that he’s been dealing with, let’s call her Abby, turns out is nutso and he wants to leave. I was looking over his lease agreement and noticed that the person stated in the first paragraph as being the “Landlord,” is not the person who signed the agreement on the last page. (This is a homemade rental agreement someone slapped together.) I’ve come to find out that Abby is not even related to the the Landlord, and is not listed in the agreement as being a designated property manager, or something similar. Abby also is not listed in local property records as being on the deed to the house. Her only connection to the property owner is that she is dating property owners son. But Abby has been the one collecting rent. He’s already paid half the rent for January, but is he obligated to pay the other half?  No.  No where in the agreement is it expressly stated that “Abby” has permission from the property owner to act on behalf of the property owner as the landlord/property manager. Would this need to be disclosed?  ….The property owner can call whomever they like the landlord...that doesn't really matter. Your brother sounds to have a valid lease.
