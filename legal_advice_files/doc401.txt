 hi Reddit, I hope I am finding you at the right place. the gist of the story is, before new years, he borrowed a piece of tech equipment valued at approx $600. I have borrowed his equipment before so I have no trust issues. after New Years, he contacted me to purchase an accessory valued at $250. he picked it up at my place and I told him that he can send me payment whenever it is convenient for him. over the last few weeks, I send him a few messages about the payment. I can see that he has read my messages due to the read receipt, but has not further responded. I thought maybe he was going over some personal issues so I told him that as long as he decides to pay me back, I have no problems with it. but the thing is, he did not address anything at all. now, due to him not responding to the payment for the 2nd item, I am worried that I will not able to get the first piece of equipment back. therefore, I would be out about $850 should he decide to cut contact. he goes to a local university and I have called his apartment today to make sure he is ok because I sincerely hoped everything was ok. reception went to check and everything is well, so now I can confirm that he has been avoiding my messages. how should I proceed from here? I would prefer to resolve the conflict at the lowest level before police or other authorities are involved. I'd say give him a less "lenient" payment date. Ask if he is having any financial issues and offer to help, in the form of a payment plan or something similar. Whether or not he does, you either need to give him and enforce a strict payment plan, or set a full payment amount to be paid by a certain date. If all else fails, you could go to small claims court, but with the hassle and all the fees/time you'll need, it might not be worth it. Maybe try contacting his direct family, or someone he is in contact with.
