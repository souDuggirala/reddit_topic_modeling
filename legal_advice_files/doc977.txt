 I just got a $100 ticket for a red light camera. I just came out of the MCAT exam and just wanted to go home and watch Netflix and sleep. Anyways I was on video making the right hand turn at legitimately 1-2 mph with my foot on the brake and checking for cars. I guess I didn’t make a “complete stop” before I turned. No sense in fighting it right? Sounds like a stated entity, if you really wanted to fight it you could but as earlier easier and less of a headache to pay it  I assume it's from the city of Rosemount. That's what the heading says. The address on the return envelope is "Photo Enforcement Program PO Box 577 Bedford Park IL" and the return address on the actual photo enforcement ticket envelope is "PO Box 309 Lombard, IL" The website to view the photos and video is redlightviolations.com Is it a private company whom sent you the letter or a state entity?  Yeah, I was reading about that online. I could send in a contest letter vut I have been reading on some online forms that when you send one into Rosemount they just ignore it and send you to collections... Probably best bet is to pay rn and just forget it so it can't haunt me in the future Yeah just pay the fine and move on. It kinda impossible to fight and win the red light camera ticket in IL. The only time you can win is when you had a stolen car report before the picture taken or something like that. If you want to fight it, you have the right to face your accuser. Who is the accuser? See where I’m going with this...as always talk to a legal professional. But just pay the $100 fine and stop next time. Less of a hassle.  Since there is video evidence that you didn't make a complete stop, fighting it would be a real challenge. Fortunately, it's only a fine and doesn't affect your driving record or insurance.
