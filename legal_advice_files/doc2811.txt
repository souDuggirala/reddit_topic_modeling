 I'll try to be as brief as possible. I'm currently living with 3 guys in a 4 bedroom apartment. Naturally there have been some disagreements and butting heads about cleanliness, who's fault, etc. However there have been some political disagreements that have seemingly damaged our respect for each other (not a big deal, you go your way i'll go mine). The problem is one of the tenants is an ex military alcoholic and gets wasted just about everyday and has on several occasions threatened physical violence when there is a problem. I understand that guys will be guys but threatening to come into our bedrooms and kill us while were sleeping just seems like a bizarre way to make a point (he says he was joking). When he isn't drunk he's actually a pretty chill guy but it's becoming ever more clear to me that he has some underlying mental issues and i'm concerned one day he might snap. I have about 5 months left on the lease and I don't think my landlord typically allows sublets. I'm confident that if I just avoid certain subjects of conversation and keep to myself that I can avoid any physical confrontation with this guy but I'm just curious if legally speaking I have any wiggle room to get out sooner rather than later. I live in Pennsylvania.  Your lease should spell out how to terminate it early, and what the penalties or obligations would be for doing that. Not getting along with a roommate or having differences to the point of animosity is not a legal reason to break a lease without penalty. I think it goes without saying that if criminal activity is occurring (assault, threats, etc.), you should call the police.
