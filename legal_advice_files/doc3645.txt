 I have been taking pictures of all of my receipts using Receipt Hog for the past couple of years (all of 2018 for sure). Receipt hog has my receipts all saved in their database where I can access when I uploaded them and a picture of the receipt. With tax season approaching, I was wondering if I can use these digital copies of my receipts or if I need to actually keep the physical copies? I haven't been keeping the copies, so now I'm biting my nails thinking about it. You're absolutely fine if you just have scanned copies. Digital copies of receipts are 100% fine: []()  [removed]
