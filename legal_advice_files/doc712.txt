 Hi r/legaladvice. This is a somewhat long post. My wife had received a legal settlement. We decided to search for a home. Currently renting. After some drawn out searching we/I sign a contract on said home. This involved a gift letter to me for 16000. After another delay in closing yesterday we had some words, mostly involving the children. One is our 19 yo daughter, the other is her almost 30 yo daughter. The wife kicked out our 19 yo New Year's Day. She lived at Flying J for a couple of weeks and has since found a horrible place to live. She has been allowed to come back this week with a bit of friction with all involved. The almost 30 yo has been living with us since she was 18. Has never paid a dime in rent, because"she has nowhere to go and she can't afford it." She drives a two year old Jeep Cherokee. I was driving a 2000 Mustang with 300k miles. So you can see where some of he overall friction emanates With some background, Wife texts me in the afternoon says she is done, offers me and my son 5000. "That is my offer". We were set to close on Feb 15. She cleans out bank account, Leaving me without cash to close. So I had to call realtor this morning, and inform her. And the mortgage company. The sellers are obviously contacting a lawyer before they release the contract. How bad is this with respect to incoming lawsuit on breaking contract, and impending Divorce? TLDR Wife cleans out bank account 2 weeks before closing on house.  Thank you. Going to be an interesting couple of months, I believe Honestly I don’t think you’re going to find a super similar situation like this. Best bet with all the factors is lawyer(s) immediately and try and minimize as much as possible.  Yes, definitely both in the works. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced a royal fuckup like this one. Although I feel as if i dodged a bullet, in some ways. Definitely lawyer territory. Family lawyer at least and possibly real estate lawyer depending on how your contract is worded.
