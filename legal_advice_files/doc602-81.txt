I received a citation today for an expired registration on my vehicle that has been out since 7/18. The car sat for months so today I woke up to jump start the vehicle so I could drive around 60-80 miles to reset codes so I could have the vehicle inspected. Coincidentally, I received a citation for the expired registration while driving to reset the codes.

My original plan was if the vehicle passed either sell it or donate the vehicle; or if the vehicle failed I would donate the vehicle.

The car did fail the inspection and at this point I'm ready to go ahead donate the vehicle to Kars4Kids. However, I now have a citation stuck in between me and the donation option I need the best guidance on how to handle this. 

I contacted Kars4Kids to ask what paperwork I would receive upon donation and was told a "pick up receipt", and once the vehicle is finally sold I will receive an e-mail that the vehicle is sold. Next contacted the Municipal court to ask if I went the donation route what paperwork they would accept to help dismiss the ticket. The representative stated to set a court date and speak with the prosecutor and obtain any and all paperwork that may help dismiss the ticket to my name. 

What does r/legaladvice suggest? 

Thanks pay the fine.
