 Hi all, had an incident while target shooting last week with a few friends. Long story short one of my friends brought along a fellow that he knew, seemed like an okay guy at first. During a period where one of the guys in our group was down range changing a target, a time where no gun should be even loaded, let alone handled, this asshole thought it would be funny to shoot a few rounds down range as a "prank" . Obviously we all flipped our shit, I immediately knocked him to the ground, he got back up, scuffle insued and punches were thrown. After we were broken up and the guy who was down range was corralled (he wanted to rip this guys head off) asshole guy packed up his stuff and left. Now I find out he is going to press assault charges on me, and try and hold me liable for "injuries" obtained during our scuffle. Should I contact a lawyer just in case he does go through with this? Thanks for reading. Awesome, thanks for the info. First, the asshole guy can't press charges on you. He can make a police report and the DA will decide whether or not to press charges after the cops investigate. In AZ you are permitted to use force in defense of others. I would contact a defense attorney and make sure he or she was present when telling my side of the story. I'd guess that asshole neglected to mention that he was shooting at someone else when you assaulted him. NAL but sounds like you were in the right. If anything happens, it also sounds like you have supporting witnesses. I guess I was curious about the law regarding him shooting towards someone (even though he said it was done jokingly) and me intervening. You should speak to an attorney as you may have an affirmative defense if you were disarming him. No one here can tell you that will work, but it's worth a shot.  You should contact a lawyer and explain exactly what happened. Let the lawyer decided the next step.
