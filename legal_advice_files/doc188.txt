 So I've had an expunged record for a few years. I've noticed that even after your record gets expunged a lot of companies still have the old records. I found a few ways to go through the process of clearing such records but I haven't done it yet. The rental I'm applying for is owned by a very on the up and up doctor and lawyer married couple who like providing good housing to students. So they don't seem like your typical scam artist college town landlords. Should I inform the lawyer (the one I've been communicating with) that something might come up but officially never happened or do I just keep my mouth shut and cross my fingers? I'll give it a shot, thank you. Yeah, it makes sense to me for you to talk to that bureau to let them know the situation. If that goes well, you may not need to tell this potential landlord. Hmm. I'm not sure. The main method I've seen so far is to go through a foundation that clears your record with some 500 prominent background check companies for free post expungement. I've talked with a lawyer about clearing it with specific companies, when I asked if we can obligate them to take down the records he said "that's a good question" (which is a fun answer to get from a lawyer). And yes absolutely, I already got an email from a major bureau specializing in checking out tenants asking to authorize a background check / credit check. They're probably closed on a Sunday but maybe worth trying to get in touch with the bureau? While I don’t have a definite answer for you, a few questions to think about... 1) How long would it take to clear your record with this background check company? 2) How much would it cost you to do? 2) Do you know for sure he’s going to do the background check? Some landlords say they will but actually don’t bother.
