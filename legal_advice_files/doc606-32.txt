Last night I was trying to go to work and was making a right hand turn onto a busy street.. I looked left for car then right for pedestrians. There was a man standing by the crosswalk just standing there and I was thinking to myself ok he’s not going to go so then I look left again and because there is traffic I start to creep forward into the crosswalk I never pressed on the gas and was only letting off the brakes slightly. I feel a push on the car and the man that was just standing there is now in front of my car appearing to be pushing the car.. I stopped my car and then he kinda rolled down the car but it seemed pretty forced so I put my car into reverse to see him and he is lying there facedown on the pavement as if I had ran him over going 60 miles an hour. I live in a seedy neighborhood and I believe in my heart of hearts that I did not hit him, so I made my right hand turn and proceeded to loop around to see if he was faking or if he was still lying in the street. When coming back he was nowhere to be seen so I thought ok he just took off. Proceeded to go to work and an ambulance pulls up next to me and he turns on his lights and makes a u-turn toward the direction I came from.

Now the question is.. what should I do?
Because if I call to file a police report about what I presume to be his insurance fraud and he called to report a “hit and run” wouldn’t I just be calling attention to myself? Or should I just leave it and wait to see if anything happens? [removed] You should have pulled over and called the police regardless of if the guy was faking. Now it’s his word against yours and you technically fled the scene of an accident.
