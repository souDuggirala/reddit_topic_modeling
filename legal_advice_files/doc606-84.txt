 My fiancee and one of her friends moved into an apartment in Arkansas together and signed a 6 month lease on July 10th. They were living in the apartment prior to this new lease. The lease was originally intended to be signed on the 1st of July but there was a delay in signing it because of some really bad water leaks in the apartment that were not getting fixed. They lived under the assumption that their rent would be over at the end of December. They are now being told that they have to pay for January due to the new lease not taking effect until the 1st of August due to them being late to sign the contract. The landlord failed to tell them this. The copy of the lease that we have on hand says that the lease ends at the end of December. Upon asking the landlord about this she produced a new copy of the lease that we had no knowledge of that had the new date saying that the lease ends at the end of January. The copy of the lease was produced has my Fiancee and her roommates initials on it as if they had signed it, but they both claim that the initials were not them and that they had no knowledge of the date being changed. Thanks for the advice.

Here is a copy of the paperwork in question that we have. [https://imgur.com/a/BJV5wzC](https://imgur.com/a/BJV5wzC) Are their signatures on the one that says Dec 31? They signed something, right?  No. Its an unsigned copy provided her by the office. I'm sorry its a little cloudy I'm making this post on her behalf she didn't feel comfortable doing it herself and I'm trying to relay info from her Is the copy that you have on hand signed by all parties?
