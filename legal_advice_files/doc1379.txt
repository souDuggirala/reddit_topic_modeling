 Hello! On my way to drive my fiance to an interview of all things, my car isn't where I parked it in the garage. Instead a big truck is in it's stead, so immediately call the apartment office. They confirm that my car was towed earlier this weekend because it was in someone else's spot. I tell them I'm confused because I'm a new tenant, live in apartment 112 and parked in lot 112. They tell me that my car park lot is 96, despite that bot being my apt. number. On my way to the tow yard, I call my landlady and tell her about this mix up and she says the previous tenant I loved with that was using it should have informed me. I make it perfectly clear that no where in either lease forms does it mention a specified car park number, and it wasn't his responsibility to unofficially inform me. She tells me to email her a copy of the invoice, I do and then she continues to act as though she has no part in this issue. This comes after a phone conversation where she caught herself agreeing with me and mid sentence begins awkwardly trying to blame the former tenant. So reddit, does my defense hold any water? To be clear my lease agreement and change of tenant form say Carpark: 1. As in they bothered to write in the form that I have 1 carpark, but not which one specifically. You'd think if they didnt match up with the apartment number it'd be explicitly stated!
