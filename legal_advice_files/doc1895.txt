 [OK] My roommate and I moved out of our apartment at the end of may 2018; we now live about 10 hours away(different state). A couple weeks before the end of our lease the management company changed. Today, my mother told me I recieved a summons in the mail from the new management company. My roommate has yet to receive one. They are requesting 3.3k in damages and claim that my roommate and I have "refused to pay after the plaintiff demanded the sum". The only attempt to contact me and my roommate had been through my mother(they called and left voicemails). The management company told my mother they were trying to return my deposit. They have both my roommate and my phone number as well as our new address. I attempted to contact the management company on the 14th of December. The lady I needed to speak with was out of the office and a message was taken. I did not receive a follow up call. We never recieved an itemized list of damages and how our deposits were spent. We lived there for three years. Admittedly there were repairs that were needed, but no where near three-thousand dollars. Our previous management company was terrible about fixing issues we reported. The matter of possession will be on 14th of January and the matter of damages will be on 19th of Feburary. What is the matter of possession? Is the burden of proof for the damages on the management company? What if I can't make the court date because I am out of state? Do I need to attend the matter of possession? How do I prove I was never contacted and will it even matter?  Yes, both of us did
