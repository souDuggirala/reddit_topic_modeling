 speeding ticket in broomfield Colorado i know it says possibility of jail time for my ticket but I've had only 1 ticket in past 2 years should i get a lawyer or am i blowing this up into something its not [removed] You are looking at jail time. This is a big deal - very easy to kill someone including yourself at these speeds, thus why it's a misdemeanor and not a traffic infraction with just a ticket. %20MISTRAF2_1.pdf It's in a PDF that's not easily copy and pastable and I'm not finding a better format, but it's a class 2 misdemeanor. Class 2 misdemeanors carry ten to 90 days in jail, $150 to $300 in fines, or both. Get a lawyer. You are definitely looking at jail time. In my city every mph over 90, the judge will sentence one day in jail. It could be definitely be different for where you are from, but my bet is there is definitely a possibility of jail time going 104.  It is what it is. Get a lawyer anytime jail is on the table. That's a significant amount of speed.
