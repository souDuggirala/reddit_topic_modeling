 A few days ago I noticed that my bedroom door in my apartment was locked and my cat was out in the living room instead of my bedroom. I assumed that maintenance had come in and finally fixed my clogged sink but my sink was still broken. It wasn't until today that I noticed that the cash I had received for my birthday a few weeks ago was missing. The money was in an envelope on my desk and the envelope is still there but now there is nothing inside it. The amount was $250. Nothing else is out of place except also my big bag of trail mix is missing so maybe the thief was also hungry? I noticed the missing trail mix a few days ago but thought maybe I accidentally threw it away? I wish I noticed the missing money sooner. My roommates are not responsible because they are still not home yet from winter break. I don't know what to do and if there even is anything that can be done since it is cash. I can't exactly prove that it was maintenance. I should have called my leasing office the very day my bedroom door was locked to verify that maintenance had been done that day, I don't know why I didn't and I am kicking myself now because of it. The leasing office is closed tomorrow since it is Sunday, should I wait until they are open on Monday or go straight to the police? I feel like neither one is going to care :( I interrogated her today but unfortunately, she is not the cat burglar so the hunt continues Any proof that the cat didn't do it? Not robbed, burglarized.  Go to the police, you have been robbed.
