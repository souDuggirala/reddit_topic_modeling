Missouri. 

Hello. I recently sold a pair of shoes for $100, and the people sent me a check for them and said theyd pick them up. 

They sent a check for $1700 MORE than the shoe price, and said theyd pick up the extra money they sent "by accident" when they got the shoes. 

They now are saying to send the money VIA Zelle. The thing is, the check bounced, i called my bank and minE called theirs. So i am 100% certain this is a money laundering (?) scam. 

I would like to make a report on them, As i have their number, the check still, and what they have said is their name. But my parent keeps telling me i cannot make a report on it because my bank account is in my parents name (i am 20 however). will that make a difference? can i make the report without problems, or does my parent have to do so?  Noted. I will. As soon as i said i was gonna report it myself she threatened to shut down my bank account anyways so yea ill be doing that. [deleted] You can report it. It's not going to do much as this is a SUPER common scam. 

Also, you're over 18, get your own bank account.  You can still report it to the authorities. Yes you can make a fraud report to your local govt. (police). Doesn’t matter if the account is in they’re name. It’s fraud and needs to be reported.
