 I live in Seattle, Washington. I was planning on subletting an apartment for the month of December. This past Saturday i signed a rental agreement with the person I'm subletting from(sub-landlord if I understand correctly). The following day I ruptured my achilles' tendon and will no longer be able to move in. I let everyone involved know that same day I would no longer be able to move in. My sub-landlord immediately contacted her lawyer and is now saying I'm legally obligated to pay the rent. I won't be able to afford that due to medical fees and cost of relocation. Signing the paperwork is not great, I know. I've copied the contract below. and my sub-landlord is citing the first clause "accepts all legal obligations pursuant to the Agreement and this Addendum effective ." Do I have any legal rights here? \_\_\_\_\_\_(Me)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Added Resident / “Incoming Resident” Named as an authorized occupant hereby Name accepts all legal obligations pursuant to the Agreement and this Addendum effective 12/1/2018. the parties hereto agree as follows: 1. All legal rights pursuant to the Rental Agreement, including return of any Damage or Security Deposit(s) are assigned to the replacement resident and remaining residents. Any apportionment of such deposits, or of prepaid rents, between Incoming Resident and Departing Resident or remaining residents are solely to be resolved between them and Landlord has no responsibility for such apportionment. At the end of tenancy, any amount owed will be the obligation of remaining residents; any amount refunded will be returned via one check payable to all remaining residents. 2. In consideration of Owner / Agent’s acceptance of Incoming Resident, Incoming Resident hereby verified receipt of copies of all rental agreements, addenda and notices to resident (such as Lead Paint Disclosure Notices, Smoke Detector Notices, Property Condition Reports, etc...). Incoming Resident recognizes that he / she is entering into an agreement which is retroactive to the original date of the Agreement and any additional addenda. Incoming Resident further recognizes that any refunds of deposits will be made subject to the original Property Condition Report between Owner / Agent and Departing Resident. 3. Nothing herein shall be construed to imply that Owner / Agent will consent to any future change in residents. 4. Except as set forth herein, all terms and conditions of the Rental/Lease Agreement remain in full force and effect without amendment. Receipt of a true copy of this addendum signed by all parties is hereby acknowledged. Yes, you have the right to abide by the legally binding contract you signed. Or don't and get an eviction in your record. Or follow the lease break procedure, if one is in your lease. All are within your rights. You, however, have no right to get out of the lease penalty free.  If you signed a lease, you're bound to the lease. The fact that you don't want to or can't move in anymore isn't their concern. If the lease has an early termination clause, you can exercise that if you otherwise meet the required terms. Failing that, you can try to negotiate an exit with them The hard truth is that your medical incident is not the landlord's concern, and is not a valid, legal reason to unilaterally back out of a signed and executed rental agreement. Talk with the landlord about your options and see what kind of arrangement can be made.
