 Hi everyone, Me again with a follow up estate question. If my parent (who died when I was a child) had a life insurance policy that was purchased before I was born and listed their sibling as the primary beneficiary, but the sibling (primary beneficiary) died before the payment was dispersed/a death claim was filed- is the primary beneficiary's spouse (who is now remarried but was married at the time of both deaths) entitled to the claim? Is there any work around here? Any way to intervene in the estate so that I receive the disbursement? Thank you Thanks for that- the policy was just discovered and didn't go through probate. But yes, lawyer probably needed.  [removed] So the order of death is: Your parent died, then Sibling died? If that's the case, then the payment is considered part of the Sibling's estate. As for intervening... given the time frame from your previous post, probably not. The policy would have been handled in probate nearly 20 years ago. But these are still all questions you should be asking a NY estate attorney.
