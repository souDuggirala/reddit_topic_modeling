 I'm Australian, my hubby is a kiwi we live in NZ. He keeps telling me that I have no legal rights when it comes to our kids and that if I were to leave him and fight for custody I would lose because I'm Australian. Is this correct Never believe legal advice given to you by the other side. They do not have your best interest at heart, and they frequently lie. Get an appointment for a consultation with a family law attorney. The initial consultation is usually free, and that attorney will know a lot more about the situation than you've told us here.
