For context, I am from South Africa. Tensions are high, land expropriation without compensation is one of our biggest worries currently. If this bill (not sure if correct word) is passed, that means the government owns all our land and can easily take it from whomever used to own it to give it to someone else. I'm not going to go into much detail about this, but if this passes  (i.e. land being taken from farmers) there is a high possibility of a food shortage and probably a civil war.

I have been looking into applying for asylum for me and my family in order for us to escape this chaos, and was wondering if we have fair grounds upon which to base our application?

Thanks for any advice and help [deleted] Italicized emphasis added.

&gt;Asylum status is a form of protection available to people who:

&gt;Meet the definition of refugee
*Are already in* the United States

If you are eligible for asylum you may be permitted to remain in the United States. To apply for Asylum, file a Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal, within one year of your arrival to the United States. There is no fee to apply for asylum.

&gt;You may include your spouse and children who are in the United States on your application at the time you file or at any time until a final decision is made on your case.

[deleted] [deleted] As a fellow South African, just wow. Dramatic af. You very well might be. If you are granted asylum somewhere and want to be spiteful, as soon as the bill passes, salt the entire land so it’s in-usable. This land confiscation I’m hearing about is disgusting
