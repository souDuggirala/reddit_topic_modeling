 If possible, explain it like i'm 5 (No background in Law) Assuming you're getting married to someone and say "property will be divided in 1/2's and savings from personal income will be kept by the individual", or whatever way it's structured, it's a legal document signed by two adults. Why then can a court come back and say certain clauses aren't fair and refuse to uphold them 10 years down the line? Genuinely don't get it. If i sign a variable rate mortgage with my bank. and end up paying a figure i can't pay due to market forces, my house is reclaimed, and rightly so, i signed a document. Why is this any different?
