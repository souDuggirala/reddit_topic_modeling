 To add some detail to the title, I was at fault for a car accident while shifting lanes at roughly 40 mph, and tapped someone in my blind spot. A police report was filed and I was a fault. The driver I hit showed no signs of injury and did not request an ambulance or any type of medical assistance/evaluation. The crash was minor, with only light cosmetic damages to both cars. My insurance paid for the damages and I thought the issue was closed. Fast forward 2 years, and now this person I hit has served me with a lawsuit, claiming that I am responsible for his medical bills. Although am I at fault for the crash - a very minor one with only light cosmetic damages - should I be worried? My insurance has retained a lawyer for me, but I don't fully understand how exposed I am outside of what my insurance covers. Does the plaintiff have a case? Although my insurance covers for medical damages up to a certain amount, am I liable for legal fees? How would I/the court know he didn't have other medical complications, and is now attempting to sue to cover separate complications? (For full disclosure, this isn't my issue; but rather a friend who isn't very Reddit savvy. ) TL;DR: I hit someone with my car, now they are suing me for medical costs 2 years later. The defense attorney.  Your attorney. Courts don't vet claims. If you bring a lawsuit and file it, they will accept it. Thanks for the reply. Do you know how the courts would go about vetting the claim? What is stopping him for going after me for a separate medical issue not related to the crash? A lot of these are great questions for your lawyer. If he has injuries connected to the accident then he may have a valid claim against your friend. If your friend has crappy insurance then it's possible it won't cover all of the claim and his personal assets would be on the line.
