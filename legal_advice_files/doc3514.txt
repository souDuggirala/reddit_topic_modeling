 let’s start from the very beginning, i’m trans and gay and i’m still legally a child so i live with my parents. they aren’t very accepting which i guess kind of sucks but it’s not so bad. the main problem is my depression, i go to therapy trying to get it under control and it’s helping a little but there have been recent suicide attempts and self harm. the first time i told my mother i wanted to die she said i was doing it for attention and were saying i was a basket case. now i tend to keep quiet about my problems because i’m afraid they’ll yell at me. but that’s besides the point, now every single day they tear me apart and it just makes me want to die even more, there’s also kind of sexual assault but i don’t think it’s that serious my friends just said if it makes me uncomfortable then i need to report it. sorry i keep getting off track, my main question is will i be able to be taken out of my house, it seems like there’s just no other options, i’ve gotten several adults to talk to them and try and that hasn’t worked, i’ve tried to talk about it and that doesn’t work. nothing works i just want to leave so badly, i know that’s the best option for me i just don’t know how to go about getting out. thanks you for reading this have a nice day/night If you are being sexually assaulted, even "kind of sexual assault", in your home, you need to tell a teacher or counselor. They are mandated reporters and will alert child protective services.
