 Some douchenozzle named Amrit Pal Singh hacked my email address. (hadn't changed the password which was simple for years but I did right after I realized what was happening) Basically changed my email password and questions, reset his uber eats password, I now have his account with a bullshit number and 5 bucks on it go me! But he's still trying to constantly reset his password which sends me email notifications. He even called them took me a little while to figure out how to email off the app. Asked Uber Eats if they can help me track this guy down or atleast give me his number so I can scare him a little I'm good at that but of course in a legal manner because I'm a legal eagle not an illegal beagle. Anything else I can do? By the way I'm from British Columbia Canada and we don't even allow Uber here in my province I'm pretty sure.
