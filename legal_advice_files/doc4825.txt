 I live in a shared student house with 6 other people. But recently me and my partner have wanted to leave, we have had disputes with the other house members and have decided it would be a lot better for our mental health if we were to leave. There is a lot of mould on the bathroom ceiling and we both have respiratory conditions so obviously this is not ideal. There are also bars on the upstairs windows which worry me in the case of a fire as we would not be able to exit through the window. I’ve looked over the tenancy agreement and it mentions nothing about leaving the tenancy early. The company we are renting from have said if we were to leave we would have to arrange for two more people to rent from them ourselves. The contract is a 12 month contract that does not expire until July. I was looking for any advice on how we may be able to leave or what to do next. Thanks. Cheers will do You’ll likely get better advice here: Best of luck.
