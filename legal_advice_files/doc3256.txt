 Hope that this is the right place to post. I live in Houston, TX and I'm seeking serious seeking advice. I have a grandmother who has Alzheimer's (undiagnosed but almost positive it is), and a few years ago before she got worse, she set up a bank account with my sister in law on it (who also has a past of doing shady stuff). My sister in law had her name on it because she help set up the account with my grandmother. Fast forward to now, my sister in law has taken over 6k from my grandmother without her knowing due to her illness, and has spent it on cars and expensive trips, amongst other thingws. Is there anything legally we can do since her name was on the account? It infuriates me when people steal from elderly or sick people.  Not a lawyer, and I'm not sure about recovering the 6k. However, getting your grandmother a formal diagnosis is a must, any actions you take for the past incidents or for the future is going to be predicated on that. You'll also want to look into the guardianship laws for your state and get yourself or someone you trust appointed so that they can protect her. This is definitely a lawyer up situation. Each state has laws regarding banking that are in addition to Federal banking statutes. Since her name is on the account jointly she may have the right to withdraw funds without notification. I hear of this with married or dating couples with joint accounts. It all depends on state law regarding the relationship between the parties, if it was business or personal accounts, etc. Consultations are usually free to lay out basic facts and get lawyer opinion before retainer. A reasonable lawyer will not take a case he/she cannot win. The fact your grandmother has a cognitive illness may help if a state or Federal statute exists dealing with that. Again a lawyer is best friend IMHO. Edit: Clarification.
