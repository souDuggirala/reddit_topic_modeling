 I would like to fight this because the pedestrian had not yet started to cross but was only preparing to cross. Is it better to contest this or to admit but explain mitigating circumstances? Also, does mailing in my response have the same effectiveness as appearing in court (in Hawaii I have the option to mail in a response rather than show up in court)? Finally, can my attorney appear for me in court?
