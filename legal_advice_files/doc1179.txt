 So I had a weak immune system and when I was at the playground or park I met a kid who turns out didnâ€™t have any vaccines and the mom of the child never said I have gotten all of my vaccines but because of my weak immune system I had gotten measles from the child making my life a living hell as I had to be hospitalized so can we sue the mom for getting me sick No, you have no proof that they were the cause. For a successful personal injury suit you need to prove the person that injured you had a duty to you, breached that duty, and caused your injury. No person has a duty to not be vaccinated, so there is no breach, and you can never prove which person gave you measles.  Please explain why  No
