 Well, my co-worker managed to back into my car in the parking lot. He's begging me to let him pay me out of pocket. I took the car for an estimate and my co-worker is OK with the costs. I'm OK as long as I don't have to pay anything out of my pocket. I just want to make sure that when the repair facility comes back with a supplement (and I'm sure they will) that I am able to collect that money as well. I would like to have a contract that says they will pay the estimate amount plus any supplement from the repair facility, plus maybe some rental car fee's if needed. Where can I find some sort of template for the contract? I'm sure this happens often enough for someone to have made one. I'm in TX by the way.
