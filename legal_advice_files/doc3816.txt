 Hello all, I just wanted some quick advise about the pool I've had installed at my home. So I recently had a 30ft pool installed in my back garden at home, after it was complete I had a friend come over to see it and he was asking when him and his family could use it, without thinking I said this weekend and he was very pleased but asked if he'd have to sign a waver "like the ones at the gym". I hadn't really thought about it and it now has me thinking do I need to get people to sign a waver before I let them use my pool. I don't think anyone would sue me over something as we are all really close but now I'm left thinking what if. I'm in England and can't seem to find anything solid about this so any advise would be great thanks in advance. I don't know about in England, but here in the US, these waivers don't actually do a whole lot. They cannot prevent someone from suing you if there's negligence involved. So definitely make sure you have a great insurance policy and you should be good. You may want to try posting in the UK LA subreddit. You are typically liable for any injuries someones sustains on your property. But that's what insurance is for, I would just make sure your policy has some nice blanket coverage and you're fine.
