 I’d like to get a retail job but I’m not sure if my theft charge will show up as I plead no contest to accept the plea deal. From what I know, ongoing cases do not show up in background checks until sentenced, right? In 90 days if I do not complete my end of the deal I would be sentenced, the court date is set but if I finish everything I have to do it’ll be dismissed. Therefore it wouldn’t be in a background check right? They never said anything about expunging records I already have, just that the case would be dropped. What about the old bench warrants? Does that stay in a background check when they have been revoked? Thanks!
