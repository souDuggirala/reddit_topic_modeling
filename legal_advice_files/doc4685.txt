 Was loading groceries into my car at the store, wind caught my cart which then left a small scratch on the car parked next to me. I left a note with an explanation of what happened and my first name and phone number. If they call me to have it fixed, how should I proceed? Should they go through their insurance and have their insurance contact us for reimbursement, should I go through my insurance (and can I if I wasn't driving), or should I just have them email me the bill and pay cash if I can? How do I document the process to protect myself legally? If they call and want a repair, then you are responsible for that. If it is a cheap strach, you could have them send you a bill and pay it. Just have them sign something stating it releases you of any further liability for the incident. Your car insurance will not cover this, homeowners or renters might (typically $1000 deductible). If they put a claim through their insurance, that company will try to collect from you or your applicable insurance. First, see if they call, second, I would try to solve it without insurance.
