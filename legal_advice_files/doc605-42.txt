(Massachusetts)  Hello, I am in my 15th year as a para-educator (teacher’s aide), and I am not part of the Teacher’s Union. I was told that I was under investigation with Child Protection Services due to “rumors” and placed on paid leave. No one has told me what the rumors are or where they came from.  Two weeks after being put on leave, a police officer told me he needed to speak to me about “rumors.”  I have never been in trouble with the law and don’t do anything illegal, and I was expecting CPS, not police. I’m well loved by the kids I work with and in 15 years at this school, I have never been in professional trouble at all. I did not speak to police (I’ve watched enough crime tv to know it’s my right not to without a lawyer), and I retained a lawyer. The lawyer said he would be in touch once he ascertained what the rumors or allegations are, and that was 4 days ago. In the meantime, I have no idea what is going on or being said about me.  All I know is that after 15 years, I am no longer at work, and I’m confused and scared. This situation has blindsided me. 

1. What is taking so long for my lawyer to tell me what these rumors are? Why hasn’t the cop told him yet? 

2. If I am fired due to rumors, is that their right to do, even if those rumors are found to be unfounded? 

3. Is it my right to know who is saying what about me in regards to these “rumors?” 


 1. Ask your lawyer.
2. Not a thing. Massachusetts is an "at-will" state unless you have a contract saying otherwise.
3. No.
