 I am a kind of person that likes to scan for security cameras. Turns out the shop in front of my house got new security guard. Today me and my girlfriend were checking the drugstore in the shop and I noticed there's a pillar with a blind spot, where the cameras cannot see. Both me and my girlfriend must've looked at the cameras because I told her about that during a short timespan and the security guard must've seen us. When we were leaving, the security guard took me off and told me to get my jacket off. He told me he saw my girlfriend giving me something and me putting it in the sleeves of my jacket, also blamed me for stealing. Told me he saw that on the security cameras. When he didn't find anything, he told me to go away and threatened to never show again in the shop, despite the fact I've been shopping there for years. I wonder if such case is somehow punishable, and whether the security guard took legal action when he threatened me to never visit the store ever again. The thing is the security guard was only suspicious and obviously after searching me he didn't find anything. What is awkward is that he only searched me, not my girlfriend. The question is whether you can be trespassed from a store in this way. In the US, you can, but youâ€™ll do better to look to r/legaladviceEU.
