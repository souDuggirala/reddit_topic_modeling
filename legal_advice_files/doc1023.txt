 I’m located in California by the way. About 2 months ago my friend dared me to jack off in the bathroom while we were at this restaurant. I did it, washed my hands and went back to eating. After that happened we always had this joke about me masturbating in the bathroom so every time we went I would jack off. But today I forgot to lock the door and one of the employees walked in on me masturbating and immediately called their manager. Manager told me the restaurant is going to sue me for damages to their plumbing from me jacking off. How are they supposed to prove I was the problem?? Isn’t the bathroom supposed to be a private area?? Is this even legal???? Is this a joke?
