 My mom has been the victim of romance scams. Yes, plural. One of them talked her into withdrawing money from a bank, and they ended up taking $50,000 from a credit union and it wasn’t a legitimate deal (I don’t really know how they did it). She was following step by step what this guy told her. She herself didn’t profit at all, in fact she gave away all her money and has nothing left. She’s been charged and arrested for Forgery in the 3rd degree. •We’re in Georgia •She has a public defender •This is her first offense, ever. We have the messages of the instructions. We also have proof that she attempted suicide around this time, was diagnosed with depression (though obviously this is something more delusional...), and has been seeing a mental healthcare professional since then. Is there a way to basically argue an insanity defense? Is it realistic to hope the public defender can negotiate it down to a misdemeanor?  She has a lawyer. You do nothing that the lawyer doesn't suggest of you.
