 Location: Ohio The complex has a sign on the door that says "controlled access will be coming soon!". From what I have heard from my roommates, this has been there for months and they have not added controlled access. Anyone from all 5 floors can get into the mail room without a room key, meaning that guests and strangers can access it. They need only follow someone with access into the front door. They have a security camera that shows the room, but I imagine it's nearly impossible to see which package belongs to different people. Furthermore, they scatter all of the packages across the floor and do not organize them in front of our mailboxes, which would make it impossible to even see where my package was laid in the room. The package was delivered on Monday (yesterday). It is not in the delivery room (and I doubt the office put it elsewhere). It's worth noting that I have no proof of what was sent, so it would probably be hard to collect anyway. Even if they were liable for damages, I would not really have a case. Is there any law that requires the building to immediately change this behavior? They've had a sign up saying that "controlled access" is coming soon. This would prevent guests and strangers from accessing the room, but all 5 floors would still have access to the room. Still, they've had this sign up for months and have not given any updates. This particular package was sent via UPS (private company) but there are lots of USPS packages down there too, if that changes anything. Probably not. What they are doing is basically a "courtesy". However, most management personal will retrieve the packages for you, not allowing others into that room. You could suggest this to them. You could complain to the USPS too, as most apartment lock boxes have sections for parcels, where they put a key in your box. USPS shares some culpability for not doing this.
