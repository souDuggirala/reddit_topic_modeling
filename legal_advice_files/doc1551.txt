 Her husband passed away a few years ago, and during the mourning she signed a quit claim deed not really knowing what she was signing. Anyway, she's been paying for the repairs. Can the person she signed it to (her deceased husband's only kid) be responsible for any repairs, or is she stuck continuing to pay for any and all repairs? It sounds like, with the mortgage addressed to her husband's estate, that perhaps the will wasn't probated? You need to get your Mother to get all her paperwork together and find a lawyer to deal with the estate, the property, and the mortgage.  She pays the mortgage and i think the property taxes, her name is on the deed. Upon her death, the step son regains the property. Her name isn't on the mortgage. The mortgage company sends her mail with the name of the estate of her late husband. Still needs lots more information. This is like telling us grandma sold a car and asking if she still has to buy gas. Is she renting the home from her stepson? Is she paying rent? Is there a lease agreement? Is she staying there free but is to pay maintenance? Who pays the mortgage, and property taxes?  You'll have to provide more facts.  She lives in the house. Unless she is liable for the mortgage, I can't see why she would be paying for repairs unless she has some other interest in the property. And who is charging her for repairs? Is there a tenant?
