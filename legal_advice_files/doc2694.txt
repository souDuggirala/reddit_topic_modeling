 Hello, r/legaladvice, This is my first time posting in this sub and posting on a throw away to remain anonymous, please forgive any rules I may have missed or details that I needed to add. I worked for an IT MSP (managed service provider) company back in April 2018 for three days located in Denver, CO. First two days were training and the last day was a follow shift with an already established employee. After the third day I received some dreadful medical news and wasn't able to work for the company anymore as I would be staying at home over the next few months. I'm not going to go into the details on the medical issues but essentially I needed to stay at home and take care of my SO while she was recovering and was unable to prioritize a full time job. That evening when we got the news I had sent my resignation letter to my employer via email and dropped off all company equipment supplied to me that next morning. I had never received a response to my resignation email and didn't really concern myself with it. I just assumed my employer was holding some kind of grudge given how recent I was hired and didn't want to respond. Given that I was only there for three days I can't even say I was too concerned about the pay and at the end of the day just called it a loss. This year I was starting my tax returns and noticed I received a W2 from this employer stating that they had indeed paid me around $600 for those three days. I had emailed my employer again asking if he could verify this and still haven't received any kind of response. I guess my questions is, is this even worth pursuing and if so, what legal avenues should I take if I don't hear back from them? Thanks for reading!
