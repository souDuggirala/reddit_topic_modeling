 My Stepfather was accused of sexually abusing my sister a few years ago. We lived in Alabama in a small town and even though nothing was really incriminating, there was no way he was going to get off. So he took a plea deal. He didn't do it. I know he didn't and my entire family knows it. Even my father, learned he didn't do it because she then accused him of the same thing. She's manipulative and has even manipulated me. That's all water under the bridge, she's gone off somewhere now and no one knows where she is. We moved. We've been moving around in Alabama place to place getting...just absolutely screwed over. Over and over and over again. Getting swindled by family members and getting kicked out of housing because of trifle bullshit. We finally got a permanent residence and everything looked like it was going to be okay. Today some investigators came out and talked to my mom about him living here. It's a brand new house and we sunk all of our money into it. We're broke. They come and tell her that he can't live here because of his daughter that is here. She's five and he's been living with here ever since the incident. We were told he would be fine because my sister wasn't living with us at the time of the incident, but they come here today saying that even though we want through three other counties that okayed it DHR will take her if she comes back. Is there anything we can do? Is there anyway that we can at the very least be all together?  We have moved multiple places and he was allowed to live with us and my sister after this happened so yes, it is news to us. Convicted child molesters aren't allowed to live with children. I have a hard time believing that that's new information for your family.
