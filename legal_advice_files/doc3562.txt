 November 24th received a phone call from my Program Manager saying that our boss wanted to talk to me about firing someone. This someone, was a no call no show. Little did I know this person was trying to set up a government Director so that the company could win a contract protest. My boss threatened that I would get fired if I did not say that the government employee told me to fire the person. They also said that I initiated some new things in the contract that I had no involvement in. The Director of the site actually sent out an email to everyone in the contracting company of a change and named me in taking the lead position. My program manager followed as instructed and named me as the new Lead for the project. I then was accused by the Boss about going outside of the existing contract. I told him that there is an email proving that I was just following orders. On November 26th, I was fired via email with the reason of unethical conduct. I received no severance or anything, and to make everything even crazier, a week before I received a recommendation by the Program manager to receive a 20k raise as a result of taking on more responsibilities my Boss agreed and approved the raise. He actually went to the board to get this approved. So is this wrongful termination or retaliation? I know CA is a right to work state, but there was no reason for them to let me go except I rained on their parade in trying to sabotage a government official. i'd suggest making another post and explain what's happened in the past while. I am trying to contact lawyers but failing to get anyone to take the case. Since then I got another job at the same facility with a different company. The company that fired me told my friends that they cant talk to me or hangout with at work or after work. Many of my friends are afraid to lose their jobs so they are avoiding me. Are they creating a hostile work environment?
