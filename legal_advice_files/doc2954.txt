 Hi! Some of you may have seen this on the news, it is currently in all major Hong Kong newspaper. Our company is an airline based in Hong Kong, 120+ of us works for this company but is based in Toronto. We are canadian tax paying citizens. Some of our crews has worked at the Toronto base for more than 10 years. All of us has worked for Toronto base between 3-10+ years. The airline suddenly did a group termination, without prior consultation or discussions. What can we do? Our union rep has not been helpful and advised us against hiring a labour lawyer as a group. The union will provide a union lawyer but at this point we have lost all hope in union for doing anything for us with the crews best interest at heart. Please advise on next step! And AMA for more information.
