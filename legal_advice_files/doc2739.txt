 We recently purchased security cameras for our house due trespassing issues, we have signs posted saying “No Trespassing” as police told us we needed those to have people removed from our property, so do we need signs that state we have cameras recording our property? Even if Tennessee is a one party consent state?  Thanks! No, you do not need signs.  Nope, no audio on the cameras and they will be outside of our house videoing the front back entrances/yard areas. One-party consent usually refers to audio recording... does your security system record audio? Generally video surveillance is perfectly legal without notification in public spaces since there is generally no expectation of privacy. Recording inside the home can be more problematic, especially if you're including areas like bedrooms and / or bathrooms.
