 Hello, I will be bringing suit against a contractor soon. I am wondering what county to sue in. County A is where the contractors "business" is located. County B is where my property is, where we met, where our contract was signed, and where money changed hands. County C is where I live. Thank you for all your help! Ok, thank you so much for all of your help! It could be more advantageous in that the court would already be familiar with this contractor, but that's the sort of fact-specific question that is better directed to an offline lawyer who is up to speed with your case. Thank you for your response. This contractor has been sued 3 times in small claims court and 1 time in big boy court, all in county A. With that in mind, would it be more advantageous? Thanks Counties A and B are appropriate venues for your suit. County C may also be an appropriate venue, if the contractor you're suing lives out of state. See [Ohio Rule of Civil Procedure 3(C)](http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/LegalResources/Rules/civil/CivilProcedure.pdf). Beyond that, it's up to you to choose where to sue, though there may be advantages to choosing one county over another (favorable judges or jurors, etc.). An offline lawyer could explain this to you in greater detail, and could also help you assemble your complaint.
