 Should I just pay the $112 ticket and move on? Or fight to not have 4 point taken off of my drivers license. I’ve never had a ticket before in my life and a clean slate for most of it. Please someone help me.  Ok thanks a bunch for the help 🙏🏽 Really not a big deal... Just stop speeding. I currently have 6 points spread out amongst a few different citations- no increase in insurance premiums or anything. It’s four points :(  Just pay it then No just speeding  Did you get charged with reckless driving? So honest question, yes I should challenge it?  I think I’m going to do that .. Thank you sm Thank you sm Absolutely contest it. Take pictures of the signs and know the exact location you were stopped. It’s actually fairly common for cases to be dropped if you can prove there’s a discrepancy, and that’s assuming the officer in question even shows up to the hearing. If they don’t feel like pressing forward or know they were wrong about the speed limit they won’t bother making to effort of contesting you or appearing in court. A friend once told me to ALWAYS fight a ticket. Reducing the fine for 4/5 tickets I’ve fought. In most states, 15+ over the speed limit turns into reckless driving, which is a misdemeanor and results in more points, which affects your insurance rates. It's absolutely worth it to challenge the ticket to drop it to &lt;15 mph over the limit if that's the case  Take pictures and bring them to the hearing.  NAL but have gotten a few tickets. If anything, to the DA. A lot of times you can pay to take a “safe driving” class and pay a fine for it to not hurt your record for insurances purposes. Especially if it’s your first ticket!  You can contest it, there should be instructions on how to contest a citation. Remember to bring relevant proof that the speed limit was indeed 35 and hopefully they reduce the ticket or just throw it out entirely  You could bring up the argument but you still were speeding in a 35.
