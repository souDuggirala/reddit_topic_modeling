 [MI]My gf is on probation in a county about six hours south of here. She missed a drug test and the probation officer informed her, asking for proof she went. She replied that she missed it bc she forgot to check one day and hasn’t gotten an email back yet. What are the likely outcomes of this situation?  I didn't say federally, and this isn't in a federal court. She couldn't be arrested for it now so it's pretty off that she's being punished for something she couldn't be punished for now. Since when is weed federally legal. I'd love to know. Gah. All because of possession of a substance that’s legal now. You’d think they just drop it completely.. She could possibly be open up to the full extent of whatever original charges put her on this probation plan, she could be subject to more stringent regulation, jailed, etc.  If they did arrest her, what would happen? I can’t imagine they would drive 12 hours to sort things out in the original county It'll be up to her PO, the terms of her probation, and (maybe) a judge. If this has happened before I wouldn't expect leniency. She might consult with an attorney if they put her in front of the judge again. Be prepared to have the terms of her probation altered to include more frequent drug testing. Really depends on the probation officer. They may tell her to get it ASAP, they may tell her sorry, too bad, and reign on her probation and possibly issue a warrant for her arrest.
