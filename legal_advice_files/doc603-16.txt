Does one need to disclose tickets/violations given outside the US (eg in France while on vacation) if they're applying to a US law school? IAAL (not your lawyer), I 100% would disclose. In my jurisdiction, when you complete the C&amp;F application for the bar you have to disclose all criminal history worldwide, and they can cross check your bar C&amp;F with the C&amp;F you submitted as part of your law school application. I don't think the ticket will impede your ability to get into law school or practice, but lying, even by omission, might. Good luck with your apps! What is the c&amp;f question you would be answering?  marijuana possession More info needed. What is the exact question you're referring to on the C&amp;F disclosure? Is it asking for speeding tickets??? Volunteering information that is not relevant isn't helpful. Really the CF questions on a law school application serve to give a baseline to your truthfulness and serves as a quick way to tell if you should even consider law school. (Someone with an extensive criminal history is unlikely to be admitted to the bar regardless of completed law school.) Thanks! I would.  Likely won't be an issue, but if you're caught lying it definitely will be.
