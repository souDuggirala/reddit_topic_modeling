So i live in croatia and im going on a school trip soon. We were told that we have to be in our rooms by eleven(im fine with this) and that a woman was going to confiscate our phones during the night. Is this legal. And can i do anything about it. I've tried looking trough the constitution to find something that prevents hwr from doing this but i have failed. Does anyone have advice. Yeah i thought so but it was worth a try That seems like the logical sulution Bring an old phone, give it to her and hide your real one. Boom. You won't find anyone super familiar with Croat law here.
