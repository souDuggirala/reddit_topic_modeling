 I posted in landlord also and someone suggested I ask here. my roommate and I are not seeing eye to eye and I think it is best I move out early for both our sake. I moved in 6 months ago after the previous roommate moved out. I was provided a lease by the landlord but did not sign it. the lease is up in march. I want to give 30 days notice now and move out before the beginning of Feb. I will pay for all of January. I am wondering if there are any legal consequences to this, I am trying my best to follow proper protocol.  No lease. Means your month to month..... Send your notice. And be really careful if the landlord asks you to sing anything when you move out ...actually thinking about it. your better off not signing anything at all if they ask you to sign anything on your way out Not a lawyer but it probably depends on your state's laws. It seems like a loophole but it depends on your rapport with your landlord.
