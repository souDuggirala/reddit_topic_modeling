 Hi there. Not sure if this is the right sub for this, I will delete it if not. My car is for sale currently-it’s sparked a lot of interest across the country as it’s very rare to find this model in good condition (it’s just an old VW, but an enthusiast’s car for sure). Someone in Vermont really wants the car, but I live in Oregon. I’m sketched out over shipping the car cross country. What sort of legal agreements are there so that neither party gets screwed over? He said he would do a Paypal invoice of half of the price of the car and then the other half when it is on the truck. Thanks so much for the help.
