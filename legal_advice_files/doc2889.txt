 Is it legal for someone in a phone call to record me while having a business conversation between me and a business without them notifying me? Context: Business called me to have a conversation, I said I didn't like their practices, and wouldn't hesitate to say it to anyone. They then said they were going to have their attorney send me a cease and desist, and that they were recording me. (Notifying me at the end of the conversation, not the beginning, so clearly I wouldn't have obliged to that.) . Their hollow threats about me saying I don't like their business are irrelevant but feel free to remark if you have the opportunity on any of this. Speaking on how you feel about a business isn't defamation is it? Is opining about a business defamation?  NC is a one party consent state, so it’s not illegal for them to record you without notice. That said, defamation requires that you tell someone other than a rep of the company a false “fact” and that the statement cause the company a monetary loss.
