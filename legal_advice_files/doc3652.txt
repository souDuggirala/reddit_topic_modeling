 I worked in the apartment industry for 20 years. In the 80's companies started requiring fair housing compliance training because if there was a complaint and it was determined that the law was broken discrimination did take place. The landlord, the rental agent, and even people who referred the potential tenant to the offending property could be personally liable for fines starting at $10,000 each. I see this as the biggest factor in assuring people were not discriminated against when it came to being to rent or buy property. I think if cities and the mayor, the chief and police officers themselves were personally liable for discrimination more police organzation would invest in training their departments to prevent these tragedies. Individual suits are swatted away like flies because the city has the money and influence. Most people can't afford representation so they just suffer the injustice. What would it take to show a pattern discrimination or abuse? Would that be a class action suit or some other kind? What do you think the best course of action for citizens who want a better and more accountable police department should be?  To write their government representatives. You have to have a cause of action to sue.  I recently heard a new ode similar to this. What if officers had to be bonded and insured. And they had to pay out of pocket for that.
