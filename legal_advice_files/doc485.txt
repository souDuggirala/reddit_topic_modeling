 I'm a new employee at a daycare center, and I take care of 14 two year olds with one other caregiver. My 1 year old daughter also attends this facility, but she's in a separate room. My daughter had 103 temperature this morning, and I'm a single parent so I requested to stay home with her. They asked if I could "please please" come in as they are dangerously understaffed. So, I left my daughter with my Mom and went in. While working, my doctor calls me with my results from a chest xray (tb tests are required to work with children, I couldn't get the TB test initially because I had a temperature, so they gave me a chest X-ray instead.) Results from said Xray is pneumonia. So I've had pneumonia for the past 4 days, and have been forced to keep coming in to take care of toddlers because they assumed I just had a cold and they're understaffed. I told them I had to go home to check on my child, and that my doctor was going to fax them my diagnosis and my recommendation to stay home until Monday. They have been calling and texting since I left, saying that despite my doctors note, I need to come in tomorrow to "discuss if this is the best fit". I'm a single parent so this is a convenient job for me and I need it, but none of this feels legal to me... especially because this is a daycare center full of children. Do they have a right to terminate me for being sick? Are they in violation of safety laws or something by allowing (forcing) sick employees to work, and sick children to attend? This is my first month of employment here, and this is my first day calling out. I've never been late, and haven't had any disciplinary issues.  Unfortunately, no they are not.
