 So I have 3 tickets in California that I got a few years ago at the time I wasn’t doing too well. Ended up going homeless for a little while after an eviction. Well now that I’m getting back up on my feet I found out that my drivers license is suspended and now I have a warrant for me. Currently I’m living out of state and was wondering can I just pay off this ticket and get my license back or would I have to go to court in California to get everything settled?
