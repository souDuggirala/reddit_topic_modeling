 Not sure if I labeled with the correct flair. I work in Maryland as a RN. It has recently come to light that my employer has put restrictions on who can “qualify” for FMLA.; weekend alternative (working every weekend, two twelve hour shifts) or part time employees are being refused FMLA by the employer. Is this unlawful? I thought an individual could qualify for FMLA and it was not up to the employer to deny coverage/time off/interfere with FMLA no matter how many hours an employee is scheduled to work.  Perfect! Thank you!  To qualify for FMLA you must have worked at least 1250 hours in the past 13 months. It’s not the employer putting those restrictions on it, that’s written into the law. Sounds like the people who would be denied might not have worked 1250 hours in the past 12 months.
