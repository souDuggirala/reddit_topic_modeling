 I received a letter in the mail this weekend from the Richmond City Sheriffs Department requesting I appear for a warrant about a "hit and run, unattended vehicle." I never have committed an actual hit and run, so what I assume the warrant is for is as follows: A couple weeks ago, I had a doctors appointment first thing in the morning. My doctor, being in downtown Richmond, has a gated parking lot with a self-serve gate to get in and out. Upon leaving my appointment, I received the necessary parking token to get out of the lot; however, when inserted the token into the machine, nothing happened. I sat there for a couple minutes and tried several different methods to get the gate to raise. I tried inserting money into the machine (you can also pay $10 to park if you don't have a validation token), but it wouldn't take my bills or coins. I tried putting a coin down the token slot to see if the token hadn't fallen all the way down. I tried reversing and pulling up to the gate to see if something was motion activated. Nothing worked. Also, keep in mind, the lot seems to be operated by a third party and there is no central office in the office building where I could go for an issue with parking. I was stuck and didn't know what to do. After several minutes, I was stuck and in a hurry to get out of the lot and get to work, so I slowly pulled into the gate. My car went under it fine, but when it got to the top, my roof rack knocked it off of the post. Seeing as though there was nothing I could do at that point, I went along with the rest of my day. There was no real malice in what I did and I did not mean to commit a crime, I simply saw no other way to get out of the lot in a timely manner. So, my question is, what should I expect with this warrant and how should I proceed? I plan on appearing at the sheriff's office this week (probably tomorrow after work), but what is my best course of action? I don't make good money and can't really afford an attorney. For additional background, I have no criminal history whatsoever and my driving record is spotless. Thanks in advance for the help! I've never been in any situation like this before, so I have no idea what to expect.  "Hi, my name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and I'm the one that knocked this gate off the post. The gate was not opening and I there was no evident way to contact anyone, so I drove under it and inadvertently damaged it. Please contact me at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to discuss the matter." Leaving a note like that would be wise, the next time you find yourself driving through a closed gate.  That is a hit and run with property damage. The best course of action is to retain an attorney. If that's not possible, don't try to explain yourself to the police and request a public defender. Don't answer any questions until you speak with your representation. Either way you're looking at a criminal charge, best I can find is a Class 1 misdemeanor if the damage is less than $250, Class 4 if it's more.  The inoperability is not pertinent because you can't just run through a gate and damage it because it won't open and then leave without telling anyone. You will have to see how far the sheriff is trying to take it and consult a lawyer.   You damages somebody else's property and drove away. That is literally the definition of a hit and run. And they likely have it on video, too. 't make good money and can't really afford an attorney. You may want to reconsider the affording an attorney part - it may save you from getting a permanent criminal record which will haunt you for the rest of your life. And please, stop confessing to how you committed a hit and run while trying to explain how you never committed a hit and run. You need a lawyer right now, and you need to stop talking about this with anyone until your legal counsel has properly advised you. Thanks for the info. Is the gate being inoperable and me being unable to leave the lot not at all pertinent to the case? One last question -- if I do end up owing restitution, will the case be dropped or will this end up being a mark on my criminal and/or driving record? Thanks again! You committed property damage with your vehicle and left the scene, so that is a hit and run. Your lack of malice isn't germane because you knowingly damaged property and left. You need to answer for the warrant and will probably end up owing restitution/property damages.
