 A while back I came across my mother in a drunk/high type of state, so I became suspicious and found pills with a scratched off label in her purse. My family as a whole did not know she was prescribed anything and it was obvious they weren’t hers. Fast forward today and it’s the same case, but this time the label is intact and it has the name and address of the man selling my mom these pills. Before any action is taken, what are the legal parameters that I should consider? I’m located in Miami-Dade, Florida. It could also be the name of an innocent guy who had his pills stolen. Do you know that's the person selling them to her? Very often in these situations medication is stolen or prescriptions are forged. Either way, you can take the information to the police, but understand that your mother may be arrested. You can report it anonymously, but the police may not be able to follow up on such a lead.  If you report it to the police, your mother could be arrested.
