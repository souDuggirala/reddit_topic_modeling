 Hello, group of family members invited us to go to the casino while visiting in Colorado unaware that you have to be 21. (From a state where the age to gamble is 18.) Anyways, friend got ID’d and got in trouble and has to go to court. We’re leaving Colorado soon and thinking about getting an attorney. Could it be possible to get an attorney from Colorado while living in California to fight my case for me? Do I have to physically visit the attorney or can I just contact them through phone/email while they fight the case since I’m out of state?  You can hire a lawyer over the phone if need be, but yes someone needs to appear in court. Either you or the lawyer.  My friend was charged with underaged gambling. Given a court date. Asked if he could pay a fine since we are from out of state but have to go to court for the judge to decide. Im still failing to see why you need a lawyer. What could you have been charged with? Yes no one asked when we entered until about 20 minutes later. We were aware that the age to enter was 21 when we got there. Unfortunately we were at a casino town with nothing but casinos so there was nowhere else to go. (Still not an excuse though.) Im curious how he got in trouble. Usually at a casino they will ID you before you get there or at least ID you at the table. At that point if you are underage they will tell you to leave. If anyone is going to get in trouble it is them for allowing a minor to gamble without checking their ID
