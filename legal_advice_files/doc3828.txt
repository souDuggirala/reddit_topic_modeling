 Hey legal advice, just trying to make sure I have all of my ducks in a row. My ex and I are parting ways but she is making moving out of my apartment the worst process. She is not on any lease whatsoever and only my name is on all bills. She only gets her mail there. She says that since she gets her mail at my apartment and that her stuff is moved in that it’s considered her house too? I haven’t found anything about the mail upon internet searches but aside from a generous few weeks, I don’t owe her any extra time do I? Thank you in advance.  Please don't think that it's just a 30 day process to remove her. Keep in mind that she may still refuse. In that case, you'd have to go through the proper eviction procedures for your state.  Okay that’s what I kept seeing and that’s plenty of time. I’m glad that everything is squared away then. Thank you so much for the clarification!  You owe her 30 days as her landlord. Probably the easiest way to get her to leave is offer her money for moving expenses and finding a new place.  If she lives there she is a tenant. You will need to follow the eviction for month to month tenancy in your state. The mail has nothing to do with it, tenancy is defined by actual living there, with or without a lease.  How long has she been there? Because more than likely, she would be considered a tenant. Therefore, she would require the proper notice, which for a month to month tenant in Ohio is 30 days.
