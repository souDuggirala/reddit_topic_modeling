 Hi all, throwaway cause this just happened. I work as a contract nurse who does assignments in various states around the country. My home base is MA and I was doing a contract within the state as well. I started a new job last week and noticed that the staffing practices of the facility were in violation of state law. When I brought this up to the management my contract was abruptly terminated and I was left high and dry with not much of an explanation. I had moved out of my current home and left my current position for this job. I'm most upset with the staffing agency that got me the job. I had not worked with them in the past. They have a monopoly on this specific hospital and I was never told that this was going on. I was suppose to have around 15 weeks of work and find out four hours before my next shift that I'm fired. Do I have any legal recourse? Can I file for unemployment as a contracted employee? Help!? You should be able to pursue the contracting agency for promissory estoppel; you made decisions based on good faith and the reasonable expectation that your job was legal. I have a suspicion that the contracting agency may be interested in having you quietly go away with a settlement and an NDA in exchange for you not pursuing whistleblower violations.
