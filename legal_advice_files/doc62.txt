 Hello, so i tried to get a ppo on my ex for showing up at my job, threatening to kill my girlfriend etc. Judge ordered a hearing, and i could not afford to have her served in time My questions are Am i going to be in trouble for not being able to have her served? Will this be dismissed and illl have to do it over? Do i still show up for the hearing? Thank you It will most likely be dismissed if you don’t show up. Just my experience, but I’m in Ohio... I had a ppo against my ex. He was served his papers in jail. He did not show up to the follow up hearing after his release. I was granted the full 5 years on my ppo. He then filed to have the ppo amended to take our son off of it, but I was never served paperwork until afterward. By the time I got it, and secured a lawyer, I ran out of time to file again to have our son put back on the ppo... So... long story short, I’m fairly positive you will be ok if you don’t have her served in time, but you still need to show up. She can file to have it amended later if she does not agree with the findings. There is a very small window for that, though. I think it was 2 weeks from the time it was filed. Helped Thank you No, you won’t get in trouble, you just will likely not get the order granted. Possibly, or at least continued. She has the right to contest the order, so if she’s not served she can’t come to the hearing to do that. You should still go so you can explain that you couldn’t get it served in time.
