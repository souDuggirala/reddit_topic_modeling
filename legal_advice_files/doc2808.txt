 A friend of mine is in county jail and has been granted medical release to meet a specialist for his condition (scheduled prior to his arrest). He asked me to pick him up from jail on the date of his appointment to drive him to the hospital (in a different county) and back to jail afterward. I'm wondering whether it's legal for me to pick him up, or whether he would have to find some other way to arrange transport. Oops, sorry about that. I think I would still call the county jail to get info on what the protocol is. The post clearly states that he's being released. The question isn't whetger he can get out, it's whether I'm allowed to transport him. Call the local number for the jail and ask.
