 And using a known password that they long ago gave you as one they generally use? Consider the possible consequences. Do you think your spouse would report you to the police? Even if it’s not illegal, the police can still harass you. If you’re doing this as part of a pattern of intimidation, spying, controlling, or abuse, your spouse could use this as evidence for a restraining order against you, or in a divorce trial. Even if there’s no abuse or divorce involved, do you think your spouse would be upset if they knew? So you don't have current, explicit permission to access their accounts? Then you shouldn't do that. I don't remember. When they made the account forever ago they very well may have. But I wonder about implicitly too by saying here's my main password I use for stuff. Did they give you permission to access their accounts?
