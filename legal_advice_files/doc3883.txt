 We were off lease for 1 month, and agreed to extend into the next month at the same monthly rate. We finished moving out on the first, after we said we'd be out on the last day of the month. The landlord was able to fill our apartment shortly after we left, and is refusing to give us any of our security back. Is this... legal? I'd expect some sort of prorated cost to come out of our security. I've reached out to try to get a portion back, hard refusal. I just want to make sure everything is fair.  . Generally, the landlord can make deductions as reimbursement for the reasonable cost of repairs beyond normal wear and tear (if you have damaged the apartment); or, as reimbursement for any unpaid rent. Your landlord should be giving you an accounting of what the deposit is being claimed against. If he refuses, then you can try suing them in small claims. One caveat. He may claim that you were still occupying the space and owe an additional month's rent. Some jurisdiction don't care if it's one day or a week or 23 days, if you're there during the period, they may have no obligation to prorate anything. That's why it's important to be out when you say you're going to be out.  Sorry I missed this. It was a security deposit.
