 I invited friends over for a dinner party. One of my friends drank too much and decided to leave her car in my driveway and Uber home. Over night, the snow came off my roof and smashed in her windshield. We are in upstate NY and there were a solid 3ft of snow on the roof. Falling snow is not a new concept up here. Who is responsible and who's insurance pays? Do I use my homeowner's or her use her auto policy. If there is a deductible, who pays it?  Shop around for windshield replacement, last time I had mine done it was via a claim in a no-deductible state, but I had moved to a state that does not have a requirement for no-deductible windshield replacement... I asked the tech what it would cost out of pocket and it was like $220. That is a comprehensive claim on auto insurance. Homeowners will not cover a weather related incident of act of god. The house did not damage the car; the snow did. Unless the homeowner was somehow derelict in preventing a safety issue, which snow on a roof is not, they will dent the claim. It is normal for comp coverage to have a deductible. That is the duty of the insured to cover.  Her car insurance is going to cover it, but she has a $500 deductible. I have offered to pay half because she is my friend and I can't help but feel somewhat responsible. Now that I know the snow can be that dangerous, I'm thankful that I found out this way and not by it hurting one of my kids or dogs.  You can ask your homeowner's if they will cover it, they may say that it falls in the act of god category and refuse. If she has comprehensive insurance on her car they may also cover it. Both of you should talk to your respective companies and just see if either will cover the cost.
