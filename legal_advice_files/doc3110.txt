 Using a throw away for personal reasons. Back in 2014 I was a young new grad who worked for a pretty shady company who sold products and I was taking these products to markets to sell. The employer would "allocate" these products to me on an invoice and I would go sell them. There were no contracts signed and these invoices were all garbage. The invoices were written on paper and scribbled together. Come time to quit, because I found a new opportunity, the company said I owe $18k back due to lost product/under sold price etc. I was not willing to pay this and they sent it to collections. Come today ( over 2 years later), the collections agency has posted it on my credit report. I have done some research and am looking to lawyer up to have this disputed. My question is- what is the proper steps to dispute this? Should I first send a dispute letter to the reporting bureaus and wait for them to come back with verification for the collection agency and then lawyer up? A little lost here. I welcome your thoughts and any other ideas. I am Nigerian Prince.
