 Myexhusband has broken basically every aspect of our divorce agreement, so we have a hearing for his contempt of court coming up. Last night he left my kids with his mother overnight (contempt) and told me I cannot contact them at all over the holidays (contempt). I contacted his mother to talk to the kids on the phone, as is my right, and she ignored me. She has seen the divorce agreement/court order and I informed her that keeping the kids from me was contempt of court. Am I able to file a motion of contempt against her? She knew she was breaking a court order on behalf of her son and she did it anyway. But the court order is between he and I, so I don't know how that works. My lawyer is out of the office for holidays. I do have a great lawyer. I would probably file it pro se to begin with, however. I will certainly call him later but I'm trying to get an idea now of what I can do. Ty! Unless your court plan specifically addresses the MIL, she's not a party to the agreement and probably can't be held in contempt of it. Responsibility for it would probably fall back on your ex as he's the one who put the kids in her care. You can certainly bring up the MIL's interference to the judge at the hearing so it can be potentially be addressed in future orders, but there's no guarantee it will be.
