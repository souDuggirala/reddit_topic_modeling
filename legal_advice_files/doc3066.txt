 I seeking legal advice since I’m not to familiar with legal matters. I’m trying to make a small claim for a payment that I never received of $750. Recently I signed over my lease to someone else since I’m trying to move out to a different State. When we started the process to sign the lease over to his name, we came to an agreement that he was going to give me half of December’s rent and I was going to give him the keys when I received it. But the thing is that I only made this agreement through a text. He never gave me my money and the main office gave them the key. What I’m seeking in advice is that am I able to make a claim or what can I do to get the money back?  Do you have more evidence? A statement from the apartment complex attesting to the arrangement would help. The standard of proof in small claims court in Colorado is fairly low. The texts will establish the agreement, and any additional proof will just be beneficial.  The $750 is the half the rent he owes me, would I need any more evidence that might help  [removed] What is the $750 for? You are welcome to file a small claims action against this person. The text messages would generally be sufficient to prove there is an agreed upon debt owed.
