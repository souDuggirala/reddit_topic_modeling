 I am not badly injured but plan to sue. What should I do to make sure I’m prepared to meet with lawyers?  You can sue for your damages. It doesn’t seem like there are any. You weren’t hurt. I’m not badly Injured but the person who was sitting next to me got thrown out of the bus and run over by a car. I tried to grab her to prevent her from going out the window but u couldn’t  In my experience the proper initiative is to take everyone hostage You can buy a bandaid, and maybe some skittles. How bad are you hurt? You say not badly injured. How injured are you?  Are you injured at all? You should collect any necessary medical bills you have and add them up, unless you have some serious injury you may just be in small claims. If you have no medical bills then you are not in the place to sue anyone and should just move on with your life.
