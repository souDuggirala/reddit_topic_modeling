 A friend of mine recommended I post here. This is my first time on reddit so apologies if I'm not doing this right. So last night after work me and some friends got drunk and we very stupidly went over to my ex boyfriend's home and I stole his car with the spare key I still had. Now I regret it and want to return it, but he said that he had already called the police. I know I'm an idiot so please don't tell me what I already know. What should I do? Thanks, ShaniaMcPherson Abram-Perezville, Texis  Post contains identifying information. Removed.  What you are doing and have done is publicly admitted to a crime with your full name and small town listing, in a way that will permanently exist on the internet and that thousands of people have already seen. I hope you are trolling for your sake :)  What??? Ugh that is sooo 👿👿👿. Grrr! I have to go now, I'll be back later.  Your username is showing as "ShaniaMcPherson2".  Is your username on Reddit your real name? If so, you’ve admitted to a felony. I don’t think that you need a legal expert to tell you that wasn’t very wise. As for your situation, see if you can talk it out with him, as he may be willing to talk the the police on your behalf and make your situation easier. But please, if that is your real name in you username, delete this post and this account, make a new account with an anonymous name (something like anon273739) and the post this again. Then delete that account and never use it again once you have received the legal advice that you have sought after. I clicked on "hide" 😎 when it said "show full name". Is that not good enough? ❓👿 I already did that. I don't see my info there anymore? Except for location, but it asked for that and I fixed it? And yeah lol I don't know what the fuck I'm doing here. 😂😂😂 No you haven't  Return the car. Returning the car and consulting a lawyer ASAP is the best course of action. [deleted] Uhh Abram-Perezville has a population of 5,376 and if that's your real name, you're surely the only one there. You need to call a criminal defense lawyer RIGHT NOW. Okay so this is the second account you've made with your full name attached admitting to crimes. You need to delete this comment, delete this account, find a way into your first account, and delete this entirely. Someone is going to call the police and send this to them, I sincerely suggest you delete it all right this instant.  [removed] I'd try jump starting it first because that's cheap. Otherwise, either get someone to fix it there or have it towed. However, keep in mind it's not unlikely that your ex will try to put the blame on you for the car breaking down. Agreed. If OP's ex, or anyone, has screen-capped this post and sent it to the cops or if the cops have tried investigating this at all, OP won't be getting out of this one lightly. Is there a separate subreddit for self-incrimination? Because this belongs there.  Thank you for the advice. I tried starting the car but now it won't run 👎👎. I guess when it 🌧 it 🌧🌧🌧 😂 Do you think I should have it towed over there? Also, I messed up and I guess I can't remember my password so I had to create a new account, sorry but I'm kinda new at this. 😫  No, you haven’t. It’s still here for me to read! The post is still up with details .......... delete it, what the fuck are you doing  I hope OPs ex sees this post whoooooooosh! Good god just follow the advice here and delete your account. Bless your heart.  [removed] [removed] [removed] Should probably delete your account too. Lol how fucking cute. No. It doesn't. Even a little bit. And you knew that because you repeatedly say you stole it. Which you did. You also drove drunk and could have murdered children in so doing, I hope you feel great about that. Seriously delete this post, it has your exact location, full name, and a full admission of guilt. This is hands down the stupidest thing I have ever seen anyone put online in my life.  I deleted it, thanks. What about the fact that I still have a spare key? Doesn't that mean he let me still use it? You need to sit down with a criminal defense attorney today. Some work weekends and I highly suspect you'll be picked up within 24 hours.  Your reddit username is still your name though. You should delete this entire post and account.  "Ehhmmm excuse me Miss" ...points at username I removed that, thanks. I've deleted it, thanks. [removed] Reddit tip: don't publish personal details.  Return it. Don't talk to the ex, don't talk to the police. If you get charged, get a criminal defense attorney. I’d say first thing you should do is delete this post and your account because you used your full name on it. That generally not a good idea on the internet.  Is your username your real name? If so you should delete this because you just confessed. If the police are already involved the best thing you can do is return the car and find a lawyer. Please tell me that you didn't admit to a fellony using your own name by posting this. If it is your own name delete it now.  Why has calling the police stopped you from returning it? It doesn't matter now. The police are involved and now your ex knows you have his car. Return the fucking car.
