 In Virginia, as a passenger in a vehicle, am I legally required to identify myself? In Virginia, other than driving are/is there any instances where I must provide my ID to the police? [\_and\_identify\_statutes]()\- this leads me to think no but is there a distinction between providing ID vs providing a name?
