 So initially, one roommate(A) paid the entire deposit, and we had 4 people living in the apt at the time who were all friends. Me, Roommate(B), and roommate(C) agreed to pay him for the equal share of money he did not get back from the deposit after the lease was over. Close friends so he trusted us. However, we signed on Roommate (D) in place of Roommate(C) onto our 12 month lease, 8 months into our lease. We made a roommate agreement, which stated that Roommate(D) will pay 1/4th of the deposit. Roommate(A) left to Korea and sent a venmo request, but Roommate(D) never paid. Now our lease is over and he is refusing to pay, saying he does not have to. He skipped out on the last month's payment of wifi and electricity also. And he did not return his key and garage key which is $100 from the deposit. Is there any way to make him pay?
