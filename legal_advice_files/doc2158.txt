 So we, and quite a few other businesses were just notified that a company filed a trademark for a term common to our industry. It shows in TESS as "Published for Opposition." Are we at risk for trademark infringement if TESS does not show it as "Assignment Recorded?" I do know there is an opposition being filed but need to know if my company is at risk in the meantime. Well FYI, this happened with Subway. They tried to trademark the word "Foot long" and went on a 2 year season of terror, suing mom and pop restaurants all over the country to make them stop using the word "foot long" in their advertising. Finally a restaurant in Miami Florida said "enough" and showed that they have been using the "foot long" word since 1948. Proof: numerous photos. Judge threw out their claim in a federal district court. Media picked up on it. Suit was filed that Subway's subs were not even 12". Pop culture exploded in anger. Subway found to use chemicals in their bread used in flip flops. Brand craters. As we speak, Subway is teetering on failure. Karma. That's what we're trying to do. I've got 6 other managers/owners searching through records If you can show that you were using the trademark in question before them, they can pound sand.
