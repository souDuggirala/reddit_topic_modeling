 Own a house with my ex-boyfriend. He was supposed to buy me out... he didn’t. It’s been 10 years. I’m ready to move on. Can I force sale on the house? Also, would I seek help from a real estate attorney or family law (even though we were never married)? TIA  This is a real estate law issue - so a real estate attorney.
