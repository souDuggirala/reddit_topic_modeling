 A friend of mine said they saw a man filming, from the public sidewalk, through a window and into their sorority house. They went out and asked him what he was doing and his response was “You can’t stop me I’m on the sidewalk!” Needless to say the drew there blinds. This question is simply out of curiosity. Obviously he has the right to film in public, but is there any case to be made here by the sorority if they wanted to have the police stop him?
