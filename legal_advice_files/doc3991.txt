 I have a 2-year-old video from a private live performance of John Legend that just got copyright claimed on Facebook by Sony Music. Is Sony allowed to claim copyright over my recording of a live event just because they own that music, or because it's live does it not fall under copyright? I've never used the video in any commercial manner and it probably has like 50 total views in 2 years, so I'm curious just out of principle.   Your commercial use, or lack thereof is irrelevant. They could actually sue you for damages in the amount they would have charged for every view it got. Be glad you just got a take down. Yes. You need permission from the copyright holder to use their song.
