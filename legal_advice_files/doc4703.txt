 Hello all, Posted this over in r/personalfinance but thought I’d get some help here as well. Please excuse any errors; first time posting here. My wife and I have a lot of debt. Probably around 20k- 30k range. It’s all credit card debt. I should be able to finally take a full time position at work next month, and we can hopefully start knocking this debt out. One of the collection agency’s is actually a Law Group and after requesting verification of the debt (it’s around 4k) they sent the verification but also sent a letter of intent. The letter of intent states, “Notice of Intention to File Litigation and Incur Court Costs and Legal Fees.” We can not afford a lawyer but do not want to ignore this law firm, so I have two questions? 1. What is the best response to this letter? 2. Is it possible to file bankruptcy without a lawyer?  Can you attempt to settle the debt with the collection agency? If so, this should stop further legal action. It costs them time and money (and ultimately you) if they have to pursue it.
