 I noticed back in April the optometrist office I had been going to for over 5 years had been incorrectly charging me. I contacted them and they we're looking into it. At first they said they didn't owe me anything. After a few months I finally got them to agree that they did owe me money. Took months for them to even get me an amount they claim they owe me which doesn't include all the dates they incorrectly billed me. Since I had been seeing them they sold the business from one optometrist to a new guy. They claim that they don't owe me anything for the incorrect billing prior to when they purchased the office. Is this true? They have been very frustrating to work with them and this is more about principle then how much they owe me. I did pay via credit card, but that would only help me for this past visit. They had incorrectly billed me for the past 5 years. If you made your purchase via credit card, do a charge back. If not, call your insurance and file a member grievance.
