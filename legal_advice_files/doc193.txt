 I’m very desperate to get a job and get out of here. My parents aren’t abusive they just don’t help me with anything at all and I’m at home all day everyday. I am becoming very depressed. My moms been saying she’d help me get me my ID for a very long time and that I can’t do it because I need proof of residence or something and she has to help me. I have been 18 for almost 6 months.
