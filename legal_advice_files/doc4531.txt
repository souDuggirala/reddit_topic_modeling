 Recently, during my senior year, my parents decided to get divorced. We were forced to move so quickly, that I can't find any documents that I need for things like a job or college. Everytime I look up how to reobtain them, it is either a scam or requires one of the former to confirm my identity. Am I royally screwed? Or is there any way I can get my papers back. If you get a certified birth certificate from the State of California, it essentially is an original. And the same goes for your SS card and your passport. Do they hold the same weight legally as the originals? You can request duplicate documents from the issuing agencies. Start with your [birth certificate]().
