 Its possible I'll leave something out so if there's any questions feel free to ask. My car broke down so I left it at a friend's apartment. A few days later I had a fallout with my then roommates and moved out. One of them then went into my car (he knew the electronic door code) and took my tools and sold them to a pawnshop. Upon finding this out today I went to said pawnshop and they told me the item will be available in 3 weeks and I can buy it from them. Where do I go from here? Forgive any terrible formatting idk what I'm doing lol  That is Exactly what you do. They will arrest him, and you will get your belongs back through the court system, which will make him pay for it as part of his punishment.  You call the cops and file a police report. Tell them you know who took them and where the tools are. They can go to the pawn shop and check the paperwork to verify who sold the. To the shop.  If you have been robbed then the normal approach would be to talk to the police Did you file a police report for the stolen tools?
