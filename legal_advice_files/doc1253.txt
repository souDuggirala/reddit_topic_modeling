 Hello all, not sure if this is the right sub but I’m in desperate need of advice/help. So when I was younger my uncle passed away and left approx $22,000 each to myself, my siblings two cousins in a trust. Which we were supposed to be paid out upon turning 18. I’m now 24 haven’t seen a cent of it. My mother is the person that was in charge of the accounts before we were 18, and still is? The accounts were originally in a credit union but in 2008 I remember going to the credit union with my mom signing a bunch of things to close the account, she wanted to move it to another bank. I was about 13 at the time and had no idea what I was even doing. The thing is, I have no idea what bank it’s been put in, neither does my grandma who’s been trying to help me. Whenever I try and ask my mom or show her the will she avoids the question or says it’s for education, when it’s not. Myself and my grandma have an weird feeling about this. We’re basically stuck though. I’m unable to contact the lawyer who helped with the will because he died years ago. I’ve checked online at bank of Canada for unclaimed bank accounts but that came up empty. I have no idea what to do to get ahold of the money that’s rightfully mine and is being held hostage basically. My mom is very manipulative emotionally abusive so I’m scared to even confront her I don’t feel safe doing so.  That’s what we both fear. The thing is, my cousins received their money as soon as they turned 18. I live at home am scared to confront my mom make my life hell at home.  Well that money is probably long spent. Consult with an attorney, they can do some digging to find out where the money went. You might have to sue your mom.
