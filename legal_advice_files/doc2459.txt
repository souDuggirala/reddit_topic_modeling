 Hello r/legaladvice During the summer of 2017, when I was 16, I attended debate camp at Georgetown university in Washington DC. My room was set up with a bunk bed for my room mate and I, and the top bunk did not have a rail. I was friends with the other debaters on my floor, and had been inside most of the other dorms at least once if not more. All of the other rooms beds were set up as two separate beds, low on the ground, not as bunks. The dorms that did have bunk beds all had a rail on the to bunk to prevent falling out. I had an RA who was an employee of Georgetown university who would check the rooms every night before lights out, so he was definitely aware that my bunk did not have a rail on top. One night, during the start of the second week of the two week camp, I rolled out of my top bunk during my sleep and landed on my leg, breaking my ankle almost clean, fracturing my tibia and fracturing my shin in two places. I passed out from shock on the floor, and woke up the next morning unable to get up, so my room mate called the campus emergency service and I got it x rayed and casted at the Campus hospital. In this situation would they be liable for the personal injury of a minor? And if so am I able to sue? Thank you all TL;DR broke my leg at Georgetown debate camp in their dorm, would they be liable? If it's that much your mom (not you) is well into attorney territory and should get a consultation from a personal injury attorney to see if there is a case to pursue the University.  They didn’t pay for anything  10k + and insurance How much did she pay roughly?  They didn’t pay for medical stuff, mom paid  Sounds like they paid for the damages (medical care). What else are you out? What exactly are your quantifiable damages here?
