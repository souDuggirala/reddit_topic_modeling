 This is in Minnesota This happened a few weeks ago, and now I've been subpoenaed to testify before the court tomorrow. I have prior drug convictions so I don't know if that'll come into play at all. Any idea of how this is going to play out? Why would I have to testify if they were in her possession? I'm a little nervous, but I don't think the judge will side with her. Thanks! Sorry if I'm misunderstanding, but are you saying that this won't turn back to bite me? My concern is that I'll get in trouble because there was drugs in my car. Having her catch all the charges isn't my biggest concern, though I'd like to see her pay the price. As long as I'm in the clear, that'd be enough for me. Damn, that's what I was thinking. I'm told that she priors as well, so hopefully that works in my favor. Your priors will come in at trial if it goes that far. Since your haven't been charged you aren't in any trouble. Defense is just trying to create a reasonable doubt so the jury will find their client not guilty. The drug charge might be dropped but the auto theft charge will likely be enough. The defense attorney is attempting to create reasonable doubt. It may work, especially since you have prior drug convictions.
