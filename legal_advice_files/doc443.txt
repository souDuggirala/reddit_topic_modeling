 In short, I'm planning on finding sought after products on sale on various websites and then putting them up for listing on Ebay for a slightly inflated price. Then when they order the product, I will ship it to their address from the store website and make a profit. Is this legal? You'll need to check the ToS of whomever you're buying from. For Amazon, for example, you can't have an order from a 3rd party site (in this case, your own) and have products directly sent to customers. This is called dropshipping and Amazon only allows it through their FBA program. Of course. There are companies that buy from Walmart and sell on amazon and Ebay and make millions a year.  I don't see why it wouldn't be. That's something you'd have to look into the terms of service on the individual websites for.
