 So a year ago, my girl and I broke up, and got back together very briefly. She was pregnant a short while later. I signed the birth certificate at the hospital post birth. Later find out she hooked up with a dude while we were broken up. Kids not mine, I took a paternity test. I want my name off the birth certificate. It costs a pretty gnarly sum though, and I think she should be paying it. She's been rather slow about it, and I'm considering threatening her with an attorney. Does anyone know what legs I have to stand on? Arizona, btw Why on earth would you think SHE should have pay this? You signed it.
