 [US] I recently made a post regarding my confusion about a "free for commercial use" font, and although a lot more information has become clear, a lot more has also become confusing. The font in question is "EDB Sweatin' It", a font that claims it is 100% free. On the text document associated with the download, it claims "you may use this font in any way that you see fit", and at the end it also states "you may not sell it". This is where my problem lies however, as as stated in my previous post, the font turns each letter into "stick-figure-esque" characters, and I believe one of the characters- the letter "H", would make a cool clothing design/logo. I have contacted the creator of the font, and I am now waiting on a response, but for now, is there anything I should know for sure? Basically, I'm not selling the font, but am I allowed to put the font on clothing that will be sold? Thank you for posting an update!
