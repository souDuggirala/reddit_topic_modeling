 I’ve been trying to research this around the internet yet cannot find anything. I am legally a resident of Virginia. In this state, you must be 21 to apply for train for a concealed carry permit. However, in NC, right next door, the age is 18. I’m not here to debate whether I should. I’m not here to debate firearm law. I am simply asking, is that permit and handgun valid legally honored in my home state, or do I have to be a NC resident to apply for the permit there? Thanks [removed]
