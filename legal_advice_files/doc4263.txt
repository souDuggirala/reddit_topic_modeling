 My job takes credit card tips, at the end of the shift I get paid out in cash any tips on the card. I got the 50 from them but the issue is I don't remember when I got the 50, I tend to just hold onto my cash tips for stuff that is easier to pay for in cash. From a few months of tips I have only received 2 50s and I am absolutely sure I didn't get a 50 from a customer. What should i do with the 50? I assume its not worth the trouble to turn it in or try to get the restaurant which paid me in fake money (unknowingly ofc) to pay me properly. Should i just toss it? There’s nothing you can do If you turn it in to a bank they will call the police/secret service who will question you and file a report but you don’t get compensated for the fake bill There is no moral way of getting the $50 you are owed Are you sure it's fake? I had this happen to me recently with a $20. The cashier insisted it was fake. I brought it to my bank who confirmed it was genuine.
