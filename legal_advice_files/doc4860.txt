 Related statutes/ordinances: Section 49.01(2)(B); Tex. Transport. Code 524.041; 1 Tex. Admin. Code 159.265 I got my first DWI a few months back (which is still pending) and I chose to fight the suspension. I have been waiting on the new hearing date since they extended it, but didn’t get a notice at my current residency or my old residency. So I checked my mail last night and I got smacked in the face with a letter stating I missed my court date and that now my license is suspended for presumably 3 months....but the notice didn’t say how long, just said “for the time established by law” The notice also listed that there was probable cause to be pulled over and solid evidence I was intoxicated. I guess my question is should I even fight this or just accept my license is suspended? Any other options?
