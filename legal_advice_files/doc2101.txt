 If a kid is on private property and someone wants to take their picture does the child get to give consent or does a parent/legal gaurdian have all rights to give consent for the child Under 18? Never. Escape? Until parents say something in writing. Alright thanks second question what cases does a childs preference overrule a parents [removed] That's different. If you take photos for private personal use, especially your own interaction, then you can until you are told not to. But if you use those photos commercially, you need permission. Same private property Are you on the same private property? Or taking photos out in the public? The question im asking is about private property and consent between parents and kids Anyone in public out of doors has no expectation of privacy. You can not trespass the eyes or cameras, video recorders, ect. Unless the child is somewhere where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, or the picture is pornographic, then there is no legal issue with taking their picture. Typically no, if you are in a place where someone can take your picture you don’t have to consent, private property isn’t really relevant in this context, if the person with the camera is legally allowed to be where they are they can take whatever picture they want. In most cases, you can take pictures of someone, including children on private property without getting consent.
