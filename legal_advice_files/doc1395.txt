 I work as an under cover secret shopper at a large retail store. I had a man trespassed from my store today for repeatedly coming in and asking our customers for money. He has been asked to leave several times by several different people in the store for this reason. When he saw me near him in the store today he tried to take the fake knives out of some display butcher blocks while looking directly at me. Not only that, but he now has my full name because I had to sign the notice of criminal trespass form. After I left the store today he called and asked to speak with me by name. Can I call the police about this? I don’t feel safe. My city is fairly small and I’m concerned he’s going to show up at my house or call my personal phone number. What can I do?
