They did nothing except give me judge mental looks  No, do you know how many ppl would be dying because they don’t wanna go to jail? Lol. You good. Take care of yourself.  ER RN here. We don’t contact the police when people show up sick (even if it’s from illegal drugs) we are just there to help. Pesticide poisoning is very dangerous so if you believe you have it, you should go ASAP.  No, they will not call the police.  Nope
