 I want to know what i can do to get my money legally i have been patient with her for 5 months. Colorado Department of Labor and Employment - 303-318-8000 thank you where would i find a phone number for them in my citys website? Looks like it starts at $31: Further information here:  well thats the problem any idea on how much it would cost? im only 18 and dont have much money to spare.  Call your local board and make a wage complaint. You could certainly sue her in small claims court for that, but you need to decide wether it's worth your time and the court filing fees for such a relatively small amount. 257 for the one day i worked i have threw text of a payment plan  She has refused for 5 months now  What kind of money are you talking about? Unpaid hourly wages, a bonus, reimbursement, or what? Do you have anything in writing showing that it's due to you? And how much? Below a certain amount, you can sue in small claims court and won't need an attorney. Have you asked her for it and she refused?
