 Long story short, I was at an apartment party which got busted by an RA as it turned out to be a university owned apartment. They found alcohol and drugs and the school is citing me for those violations. My questions: I did not know I was on school property and there is nothing in the building inidcating that it is, is it fair for them to expect me to follow school policies in such a location? I was not engaging in the activities, but just.socializing with friends, does that help me at all? Nothing there was mine and the people responsible for it had left earlier. Thanks for the help.  Alright thanks Alright thanks  You could have asked anyone who was living there (and who presumably invited you) about the status of the building. You were in a university dorm, you are a student, you are subject to the rules. You not knowing you were on school property doesn't exempt you from their rules governing their property. No, but the policies being violated here are specifically residential policies. Does the school's code of conduct specify that good behavior is only expected on campus?
