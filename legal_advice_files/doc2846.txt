 Asking on behalf of a PC-less friend (if you can believe that) and going to speak in first person as I'm relaying their info through dictation. I hope we have the right Flair. \-------- I will have been on the Sex Offender Registry for 10 years come this September. I've been sentenced to stay on it for 25 years to life. I have no other crimes on my record-- not even a parking ticket, and was removed from my 5 years of probation/house arrest 8 months early due to good behavior. There was an article brought to my attention that mentioned that some people would be able to get off the registry after ten years, but I don't think I quite qualify as it's for 1st and 2nd degree offenders, not 3rd degree like me, iirc. I'll past links to them at the bottom of this post. They were brought to my attention August ,2018. What I"m asking, is if there is any way to have my registry thrown out? I have several reasons as to why I want to do that: 1) It's impossible to find/keep a job 2) It puts a target on your back for those who would take "justice" into their own hands 3) There is a woman I want to marry and move to see in Britain, and being off the registry would expedite that by 5 years. When I was convicted, my lawyer did nothing to defend me that I didn't directly order him to do the day of. There was no preparation, no witnesses on my behalf, and the notepad he brought was blank. He offered no console during the year leading up to the case, and was borderline useless the day of. I wasn't aware that I could actually turn him in for not properly defending me, but I want to know if it's too late for that as well? Or for a late appeal, assuming he's found guilty of not doing his job right the first time? []() Thank you for your time and patience, from both of us.
