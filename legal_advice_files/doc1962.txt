 I went to Iceland with a "friend" and few days after we got there she had no more money left on her credit card and bank account to pay for expenses so we agreed that I'll pay most of it and she will gave me the money back after we got home. The thing is that a day before we leave Iceland she decided that she don't want to be here anymore and left me alone in Iceland. As soon as I got back to Canada she blocked me and would not answer me. She owe me almost 1000$. I sent her a notice but she never went to take it in the post office. I suspect that she moved out few weeks after we got home. What can I do now? Can I sue her ? Thanks ! You can take her to small claims as long as you can find her. She may not have money now, but a court judgment lasts forever unless discharged in bankruptcy and accrues interest until it is paid. Yes you can sue her. It won't make the money magically appear if she doesn't have any.
