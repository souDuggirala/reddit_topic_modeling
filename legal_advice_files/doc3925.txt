 West Virginia. For the past three months the smell of weed has permeated my apartment due to someone else in the complex smoking weed and the smell coming through vents. My roommate refuses to “snitch” and has prevented me from doing anything but at this point I don’t care. I am unaware who exactly the smell is coming from but I assume it’s someone below me. In the event that the landlord will not assist in this situation what can I do to deal with the smell. Thank you.  If you believe someone is committing a crime by illegally smoking marijuana, you may call the police and make a truthful report. It is up to their discretion as to if they want to do anything about it. Short of that, you can try to figure out who it is, and inform them of the problem. They may not be aware that the smoke is intruding, and may be able to be more considerate.
