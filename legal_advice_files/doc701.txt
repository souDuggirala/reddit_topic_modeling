 So I'm a dad whose been paying child support for the last 6 months on my 8yr old son, I haven't been there frequently but have seen him enough; since support was started the mother has completely barricaded me from seeing my son and will not allow me or my family to contact her or her family and will only go through court (yes I have plenty of evidence of this and my attempts to see him throughout his life); I or my family can't possibly afford a lawyer, and I need to have one because she will not make this easy enough for me to do on my own. How can I/where do I go to get a lawyer that can help me handle this? Do you work for free? Most lawyers do not either for obvious reasons. Your best bet is you and/or your family picking up a side job and entering into a payment plan with an attorney for legal work. Another option is finding a legal aid organization that deals with family law matters and submitting an application there. Everyone in your neighborhood and beyond probably has applications submitted there and may be on a waiting list for their help, with no guarantees of help. Which leads me back to point one as your best option.
