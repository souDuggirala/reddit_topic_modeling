 My friend, let's call him Mark, was doxxed on a website in the past week. The website apparently has huge threads of info on people they target. They have his full real name, address, usernames on all websites he uses. There is a lot of very hateful and bigoted stuff being directed towards him. We are worried someone would try to hurt him because they have his address. Is there anything we can do? I looked at Google policy but it doesn't seem like it would remove the search result for the dox since it doesn't involve bank info or ssn. We have already told him to change his passwords. His address was likely already public knowledge. Yep just dont share personal information with websites all you can do Wow. Ok well that's shitty It's generally not a crime to doxx people.
