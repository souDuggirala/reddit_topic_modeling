 When I turned 18, my dad made me sign a medical power of attorney because of a condition I have, which I had no issue with. However, he also made me sign a general power of attorney which I argued with him for weeks over. Eventually I had to sign it. I am now 20 and he keeps threatening to go and sign documents (such as my car title over to him) when I do things that irritate him. How do I go about removing his power of attorney, if that is even possible?
