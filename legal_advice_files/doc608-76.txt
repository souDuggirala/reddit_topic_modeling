So I accidentally broke a window in a university accommodation and they have charged me £603 when I am in my overdraft, they quoted the amount as £200-£300 when I spoke to them. The worst part is that they are charging £170 for the call out to fix it but overall I think the price is extortionate. To add to this they have not shown me the evidence they claim they have of me breaking this window and I don't think that it exists. What should I do?  /r/LegalAdviceUK
