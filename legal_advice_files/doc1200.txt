 So a little background. In October this guy hit my car and he got a ticket since he clearly blew a stop sign and caused the accident. Now it's gone to court and I just got the subpoena tor the case of "The State of Florida vs really bad driver dude who made my life a pain," and they obviously want me to testify. The case is on the first of march FYI. I'm a medical student who has mandatory class on that day, as in you have to sign in and stay or you will be placed in academic misconduct. My school is pretty strict so dealing with this entire situation is going to be a joy. Is there any possible way that I don't have to actually show up to court? If so, what steps do I have to take to do so? This is just terrible, I had to deal with insurance immediately after taking tests and now this is getting in the way of school again. Thank you for your help. PS: fuck this guy Employers (and I assume schools) would HAVE to excuse you for court appearances. My graduate program had an exemption for excused absences, specifically court dates, jury duty, emergency hospitalization, funeral of immediate family. Talk to your dean. Also call the prosecutors office and see if you can make an alternative arrangement. Do not dismiss a subpoena and not attend, as some judges could hold you in contempt. You should bring the subpeona to your dean.  Call whichever attorney subpoenaed you and explain your situation. They may be willing to adjust the date. If not, you'll have to work it out with your school.
