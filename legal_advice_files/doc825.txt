 I was on Instagram earlier today and saw an ad for someone asking 70$ a ticket for a raffle to win a French bulldog puppy. I wasn’t sure if this was legal and couldn’t find much information on it, but I’m fairly confident that this is against community guidelines. Does anyone have any info on this?
