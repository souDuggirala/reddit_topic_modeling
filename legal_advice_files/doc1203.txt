 As title says this was in Florida. I was in the left turn lane when I realized I needed to go straight instead so after checking that no one was coming I merged but while I was merging this truck changed lanes and swiped the front of my car. He was easily going over the 35 mph speed limit. He even admitted he didn't see me when he changed lanes. I got the ticket because I wasn't suppose to turn out of a turn lane. Am I completely at fault here? Is there anything I can do to lower my ticket? I can draw a picture if you need a better explanation. Than you for any advice you can give! Generally, you cannot cross a solid white line. Also, no one is allowed to change lanes withing a certain distance of an intersection. There's a lot of fault to go around, but coming out of a turn lane into a travel lane violates the other driver's right-of-way. His speeding is contributory to the crash, but doesn't take away his privilege of occupying that lane before you do. From what you described, yes you bear most of the fault.
