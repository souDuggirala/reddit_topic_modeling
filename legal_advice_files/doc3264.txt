 I live in Orange County. So my landlord before we moved in agreed on my brother and I sharing 1 room for 1200 a month, he told us he had a maid and so I assumed that was included cause I was very upfront about wanting to pay a flat rate for everything. Fast forward 4 months and my brother and I have found a better place so weâ€™re moving at the end of the month. The landlord told us about a month after moving in that he was hiring a maid and weâ€™d be charged half (itâ€™s my brother and I, one other renter, and the landlord) so my question is does he have a right to charge us at all and if he does should it be split between bedrooms or people? If I refuse to pay for the maid again this close to moving out what kinda consequences may I be facing?  OP refused to provide location. Post removed.

When you type in Orange County on google, it doesnâ€™t bring up Orange County Florida. Itâ€™s common sense unless I stated Orange County Florida I meant the Orange County that actually matters.  I can think of at least two, so state matters.  [removed] Which Orange County is most likely where someone pays 1200 for a room?
