 So, I moved to another state in August and have been working in said state since then as well. My paystubs show that I am still paying the other stateâ€™s taxes (from before I moved). My manager said he canâ€™t do anything about it but yet Iâ€™ve been threatened to be fired after going to corporate for questions in the past. Help Can I actually be fired for not following chain of command when my manager said â€˜nothing can be doneâ€™ ????  My manager first apparently ðŸ™„ Iâ€™m going to call up HR  Okay thank you  Is there not an HR department? Who would you contact about benefits?  If you're afraid you can contact the state tax department and have them write a letter to your employer instead. Then if you're fired you would at least have a retaliatory termination case against them. Lol Iâ€™ll try, Iâ€™ve contacted payroll once before for a separate problem and was told I could be fired because I didnâ€™t follow chain of command  [removed] Well one nice aspect of this is that TN has no state income tax unless it is for Capital Gains, so OP will have one less headache in that regard. Contact the payroll department not your manager. This isn't your manager's issue. Your taxes for 2018 will be complicated because you will probably have to file a return with NJ to get a refund then file with TN. You want to get this fixed before your first 2019 pay check.
