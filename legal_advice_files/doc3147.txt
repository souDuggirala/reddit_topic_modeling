 Location: Illinois. About three weeks ago, my uncle (who owns a large amount of land in the area) approached a family member about purchasing a farm inherited by five family members after the death of my grandmother. This uncle had an appraisal of the land done in August 2016 but has not produced a copy of the appraisal upon request. Simply put, his numbers do not add up. His offer is for 136 acres while the farm is 160 acres. It also cites a lower PI and acreage value lower than what a basic search from AcreValue shows. As a result, the offer is $200,000-$400,000 less than what the farm is probably worth. This has compounded family strife (he and my mother are having issues for separate reasons) and is leading to unnecessary drama. The family members have not provided an answer to my uncle. He is unlikely to take a 'no' well. How should they proceed in the most straightforward manner? These individuals are cost-conscious, however, I have tried to convince them that the act of turning to an objective third party (be it a lawyer or another appraiser) will likely pay for itself several times over.  Agree with the others; get your own appraisal. At some point you'll need to hire an attorney as well. The amount of the sale justifies hiring one to advise you on the transaction and the deal terms. They need an independent appraisal, and a property broker or lawyer.  "I reject your offer. Show me the appraisal and we can talk." Not rocket science. The farm is worth what it appraises for +/-  If he is lowballing you, then counteroffer, don't say no. Get your own appraisal.
