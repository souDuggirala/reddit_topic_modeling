 Obligatory on mobile, apologies for the formatting. I currently live in Christchurch, New Zealand, though I am a US citizen. I am in a fixed term lease, which is where the problem arises. There appears to have been a typo which I missed in the tenancy agreement. Rather than the intended 12 months, the agreement is for 7 months, to expire shortly into February. I have multiple correspondences stating 12 months, and have had verbal confirmation, though no recordings of said confirmation. The owner has recently notified me that they will not be looking to extend the lease, which is what sparked my realization of all of this. Is there anything I can do, legally speaking? Or do I have to vacate?
