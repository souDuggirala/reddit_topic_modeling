 Long story short, a family member passed away last week and funeral procession will be yesterday and today. My boss has not emailed me back (or texted me back) and I don't want to vacate my position without any of the higher ups knowing. There is another situation: a new guy was hired and he is shadowing me but unfortulately all of my co-workers ( same title as new guy) are all out on vacation til the 2nd. We have a deadline project we have to meet on January 2nd so that will leave the new guy here with no one to shadow for the next week or so.... What can I do? Should I contact HR and tell them what's going on? Contacting HR would be an excellent start. They can let you know if it will be considered negative.
