 A child I know may be removed from his parents' home soon. He lives in Michigan. I wanted to know, if he has relatives in Michigan but also has relatives in another state who the child actually prefers to stay with, and are happier to take him than the Michigan ones, would he be able to be placed with his relatives in the other state? What about if the Michigan relatives directly say no to taking him, would he be placed in foster care in the state, or with the relatives in a different state? What do the parents want (if they know what’s coming)? If at all possible, the parents could sign over guardianship to the out of state relatives, IF they still have legal custody of their child. Other than that, the state would prefer that the child remain in the state of MI because they will need to facilitate visitation with the parents if the plan is reunification. (Edit-FYI I’m not a lawyer, but had dealings with CPS through a family members case)
