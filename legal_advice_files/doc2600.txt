 Hi! I live in Iowa, and I let my friend borrow my airpods for the day it is no big deal so I do that and after lunch his friend took it from him and broke them later on (he took them home) is there anything I can do to be able to get them replaced? [In Iowa, wage garnishments and asset seizure and the like are possible](), unlike states like Texas, where it's damn near impossible to collect on a small claims judgement against an individual if that individual doesn't pay willingly because Texas considers most money and property of individuals exempt from judgements like that, and wage garnishments are not allowed for debts/judgements of that nature. That's true. Though in most cases the award for winning is next to impossible to collect.  In a lot of small claims cases you can be reimbursed court costs on top of whatever it is that you're suing for. You can take them to small claims court if the value of the air pods is more than the filing fee of $85.  This sounds like something that would happen to me. Iâ€™d just ask him to pay you back monthly in small amounts.
