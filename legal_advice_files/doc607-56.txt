Hey all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently writing an essay for a university class. The essay is on the Opioid pandemic, and how it is compounded/affected by the mental health crisis happening concurrently. My mother, who works as an ER and Hospitalist doctor at the local hospital would have a wealth of information on this topic. The requirements state that I need at least one Primary source that is a person (as well as a few more primary, secondary and tertiary sources). As stated before, I would like to use my Mother as a primary source in this matter. I work at said university as a cancer research assistant, and have volunteered at the hospital, so HIPPA is my main concern, since they really throw the book at you in those cases. I was wondering if asking my mother for personal anecdotes (all identifying information completely excluded) would be a direct violation of the HIPPA act.

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B; My bad, was typing it up in a hurry, actually in the middle of an experiment currently haha. Thanks! If she gets so generic as to not reveal any identifying information about a patient, she shouldn't run afoul of **HIPAA**. A cancer research assistant should know the proper acronym. ;)
