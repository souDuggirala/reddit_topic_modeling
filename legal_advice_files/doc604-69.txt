Hello all,
I'm living in VA. The company I'm with is not from the states.  My pay is fair, but after I reach the 40h each week my overtime pay is just straight time. After checking online i found out it is supposed to be time and a half. 
My question is: are there cases and where the federal law does not apply and if yes, what are they? Also if i get paid the wrong rate, what can I do?
 Thanks,  that's it! Appreciate your help :) Are you FLSA exempt?  While the fact you're paid hourly would generally lead to a conclusion that you are not, there are some hourly positions that *can* be exempt, like some [computer related occupations](https://www.dol.gov/whd/overtime/fs17e_computer.pdf) for example. There are a number of exceptions to the overtime pay rule. Agriculture, and movie theatres for example are exempt. Another common one is specialized fields making more than $28 an hour.

So depending on what you do there could be an excemption that applies.

If there is no exemption and you aren't being paid overtime, you'd file a wage claim with your department of labor.
