 Moved in to my current appartment in early 2018. I’m technically subletting. The sublease doesn’t specify who is responsible for electricity or cable. There were some email exchanges after I signed the lease that I could call the cable provider and get the plan I’d prefer. He also said he’d send me a bill for the electricity, if it wasn’t in my name already (wasn’t and still isn’t as far as I know). I picked a plan and had someone come and install a new cable box. Don’t think I’ve ever said I’d pay for this, and it wasn’t clear to me that anyone thought I was responsible for this until after I got this odd letter from him with a spreadsheet and some numbers on it that added up to $2K. (No backup for his number was included other than that 1 page spreadsheet.) What should I do? Seems like I need to at least request copies of the bills from this guy - but then what do I do? It was never my understanding that I was paying for this, but I’m not sure. Who is responsible for what in this case?
