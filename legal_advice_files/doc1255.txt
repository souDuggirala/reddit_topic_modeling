 My mom has worked as an insulator for nearly 18 years. Every job she gets she has proven herself to be just as hard working as her male coworkers, she also has more experience than most of them. She went to apply at a job yesterday in Texas and the receptionist tells her “they aren’t hiring women” before she gets a chance to apply for the job. Feeling discriminated my mother walks away and texts me. I immediately tell her that it is against the law to turn away applicants based on their gender. I want to do something about it because my mom should get equal opportunity for a job as the male applicants. There is no clear reasoning for their bias other than lack of experience, which in this case does not hold up as I mentioned she has 18 years experience. Any advice on what to do? I’ve thought about filing a charge to EEOC but I’m not sure what to expect... any advice on what to do???
