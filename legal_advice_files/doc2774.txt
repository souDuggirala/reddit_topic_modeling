 Hey r/LegalAdvice! Thank you in advance for any advice or recommendations! As the title says we've just been exploring options and doing as much research as we can on this matter and haven't been able to find any definitive answers. I'm a US citizen and my wife is Austrian. We plan to begin the process for her residency and green card soon but she is also going to be applying for a PhD program in the US this year. My question is basically, how complicated will that be for either/both visas and what is our best course of action? I know it can take around a year to get the residency/work permit so we wanted to get that ball rolling as soon as possible, but other things I've seen suggest that USCIS will see a conflict of these two different visas: one in which she wants to stay in the country indefinitely, and the other where she promises to leave at the end of her studies. Is it possible in any circumstance to have/process both? Does it make sense to do one before the other? Any information or experience you may have on this matter is greatly appreciated. If you need any more details to help assess our situation just ask I will be more than happy to provide it! Thanks so much!
