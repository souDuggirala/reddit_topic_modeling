If someone gets a temporary restraining order against you lived together but were never married and your name is the only name on the deed, is it possible for them to get possession of your house if the restraining order is made permanent?  Your question is obviously **really** value - it has almost no details. NJ's restraining order guidance is fairly restricted, so I assume that we are talking about a close family member. A RO, even a permanent one, cannot remove your ownership from the property. It's possible that kicking them out would constitute a violation for some other reason but that's neither here nor there. You should speak to a lawyer *before* doing anything to effect the protected party and hopefully have an attorney representing you at the RO hearing. Even if they are currently residing in the home and I have had to have a police escort to go back and get my things? Restraining orders have nothing to do with property ownership.
