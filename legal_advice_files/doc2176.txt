 (I may get asked about the custody situation between my ex, my daughter, and myself. So I'll just say this-- I'm the custodial parent, but the custody agreement (through the court) has no set schedule and there are no restrictions. In other words-- He can see her whenever he wants.) Now-- I don't know my ex's wife that well, but my 4 year old daughter seems fond of her. I've only met her once which was back in September (7 months after her and my ex got married), plus shortly before their separation in October (Yes, they barely knew each other and weren't going to last long being married). I knew her and my daughter's dad would have problems, but I didn't know the extent of it because they both lived in a different city (note: her official hometown but still same state: TX). My daughter has only been around her step-mom a handful of times from when the grandparents took her to visit her dad. Since separating, my ex lives back in our hometown/city, and his wife is living in her hometown/city. Shortly after meeting his wife, I learned (through the mouths of other people) that she's violent and has a criminal record. I was told she was sent to juvenile detention when she was 16 for stabbing an ex boyfriend. I am not sure how they found that out, though. (note: later when I looked up her criminal records in her county, I could not find any record of this. Although, I don't think the public has access to juvenile records--correct me if I'm wrong! So it's hard for me to verify as this being true instead of a mere rumor.) She has an old charge of marijuana possession from 2012. My ex told me she told her that she made her son hide it, but the cops ended up finding it in his backpack anyway. She has an assault bodily-injury assault charge with a family/household member from 2013 (If i'm reading the case records correctly, I believe it was dismissed). My ex told me this was a fight between her and her sister. This does have me concerned because my ex told me she is a violent person. She has broken his phones during arguments, broke his bike so he wouldn't drive off, and she has assaulted him physically more than once (note: In the 8 years that I was with him, he never laid a finger on me. He says he never hit her--instead he'd walk away mid-argument to avoid losing control of his temper/emotions which seemed to make the situation worse. With this being said, I don't know if he's telling the truth about him not hitting her. I'll stay neutral about it as far as him, although i am concerned about HER and her violent tendencies.) The recent on-going charge/case that this woman has is what has me the most concerned since it's recent. Before looking up the case records, he had informed me that before he met her, she got charged in 04/2017 with a DWI with a minor in the car (aka her 11 year old son). She was put under probation and obviously can't leave the city, but her and my ex left several times anyway by taking a different car that was not her own (So yes, she has no problem violating her probation as long as she's not caught). After her and my ex got separated--which was around October--, no one has heard anything about her. He blocked her numbers to stop her from contacting him. (note: what drove the separation after all past problems was that this woman cussed at my ex's mom and left my ex stranded with nothing on him). Later on, I expressed my concerns to my ex about this woman possibly causing harm in the future. Unfortunately, my ex blows it off which isn't surprising because he's always been the "everything will be fine" kind-of-guy in every unfortunate situation. So it's like talking to a brick wall. His excuse is "She won't do anything because it may jeopardize her custody of her son". I had to remind them that clearly she's not that concerned and aware since she drove drunk with him in the car, made him hide her drugs, and assaulted him (my ex) in front of the kid. I don't believe anything has happened in the few times that my daughter has seen her. Otherwise, my daughter would tell me since she's pretty open and has no problem talking to me about things that make her happy, sad, scared, etc. Anyways, If that's not enough of a reason to be concerned, it gets worse: I looked up the details myself on her county's website and this is what has happened recently. ^(\\\\\\\= blocked out numbers for privacy reasons) On 11/7/2018, there are several details on the case which are : (in order from last to first on list) VIOL REPORT SUBMTT , M.T.R.P. - FILED, MTRP-ORDER V\\\\\\\, REMAND WITHOUT BND, WARRANT ISSUED \\\\\\\, MOT TO REVOKE PROB ANGELINI, WARRANT RECEIVED If i'm reading this correctly, the court wants to revoke her probation due to violation. It looks like a warrant had been issued. Is there a way I can find the specific reason why a warrant was given? In other words, can I know what it was that she did that violated her probation? On 12/3-12/4, there are more details which are: (last to first): BOOKED B\\\\\\, WARRANT EXECUTED \\\\\, Offender record sent to VINE\\\\\\, Charge record sent to VINE \\\\\, WARRANT RETURNED \\\\\, MTR ATTORNEY HIRED \\\\\, BOND SET \\\\\\\, BOND MADE \\\\\, SID \\\\\\\, REL'D ON BOND, Pretrial Supervisi on started, RELEASED FROM JAIL, Offender record sent to VINE\\\\\\\\, DEF. MAGISTRATED, DEF. MAGISTRATED \\\\\\, ORD SPEC COND BND V\\\\\\\ If for any God-known reason my ex decides to work things out with this woman, I want to be able to express these concerns to the court. I don't know if I can even do anything to protect my daughter if it comes to that point. As you can see, the only hard evidence I have is the court details on the case. The rest is just anecdotal evidence, so if I do decide to take it to court.......can something even be done? Or will I get the "We can't do anything unless she's done actual harm to the child". My ex says he will follow through with the divorce, but he already has a history of leaving-and-going-back to her. If he chooses to go back with her, then I want to make sure my daughter isn't around that woman. The issue isn't with my daughter's dad....again, it's with his legal wife and her history. I'd hate to prevent my daughter from seeing her dad, but I canNOT have her around his wife. I wish I knew all of this much sooner since the very beginning. The only thing I can think of is asking the court to change the custody agreement by maybe adding restrictions or something. I'm at a loss and I want to make sure my daughter is out of harm's way. I never thought i'd be in this situation. I hope I added enough information. I'll answer any questions I may know that I didn't include in this original post. Thank you all so much.  What I hope helps you currently, is to know that she has no legal rights to the child you coparent with your ex. If he decides to get back together with her, and you fear for your childâ€™s safety, you have the options of contacting CPS bad the police regarding immediate safety concerns (and medium to longer term issues via CPS), as well as engaging an attorney for changes custody terms. Your state bar will provide you with several low cost initial consultations. Good luck.  This is really great! Thank you so much. I'm going to add this to the top of the original post!  You've presented a wall of text which many here will find too daunting to read through. I'm just going to do you the favor of summarizing. SUMMARY - Your ex husband married a woman who has a history of violence, has some minor violence against your ex, tried to avoid arrest by telling her son to hide marijuana in his backpack (but got caught anyway), and was arrested for DWI with her son in the car. He's separated, hasn't heard from her since October 2017, and plans to divorce her. AND YOUR MAIN QUESTION: - "If for any God-known reason my ex decides to work things out with this woman, I want to be able to express these concerns to the court."
