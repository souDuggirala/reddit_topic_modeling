 My Grandma now has end stage dementia the last 2 or 3 years its been bad she’s been forgetful and confused. Obviously not mentally competent to sign papers. My mom just found them. They (mom and aunt) think she was taken advantage of. My Grandma is dirt poor too so she out of all of them needed it. She’s currently in basically hospice  You can contact adult protective services or equivalent in her jurisdiction If she relies on Medicaid/SSI/welfare for medical services/housing/etc, there's a not insignificant chance an inheritance could have cost her that money if not handled correctly
