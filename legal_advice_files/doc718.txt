 Do not carry weapons onto school property.  I don’t bring it for self defense and my school is chill as long as the person has no suspicious record and the parents are ok with knives. And stop bringing the knife to school. It's a crappy defensive weapon and it will cause you a mountain of trouble if it's ever found or used.  Dude just file an assault and harassment report. He’s threatening to hurt you. If he puts his hands on you, press battery charges as well. No, blackmail is not legal in any circumstance.  You can report him to the administration or to the police. Those are far, far better ideas than threatening someone or blackmailing them.
