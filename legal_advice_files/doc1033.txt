 A little background, my former employer was contracted to implement a medical record system for a hospital in California, employer based in Illinois but I'm local to CA. The project is midway through set to go live later this year but I received another job offer and put my two weeks in. So yesterday was my last day and I get a call from HR where they notify me of breach of contract and I'm required to pay a 6k penalty. Exact language here: This clause in the contract is waivable and I will be responding to my former employer next week's with the reasons below on why I think it should be waived: For my contract I was supposed to be paid weekly and during my contract there were two pay periods where I was not paid on time. Both times were due to holidays earlier in the week and the approver did not approve my timesheet until after payroll ran and was paid the next week. Also I did give two weeks notice however as I mentioned yesterday was my last day and I did not receive my final paycheck. Do these reasons give enough validity for my former employer to waive the employee replacement fee?  That’s not the plain meaning of “terminated for cause.” The others are right: talk to a lawyer, and do not talk to your former employer for any reason until you do. Certainly do not pay the $6000.  Right I did quit but termination of contract can occur from me or former employer This clause says that in the event you are terminated for cause you owe $6000. You weren't terminated for cause, right? You quit. Yeah, you need a lawyer to look at this. The law here is odd, I would consult a wrongful termination lawyer or a lawyer that is familiar with these types of contracts. For something with this much money at stake I can't see a reason why you shouldn't take this agreement to an actual employment attorney in California rather than internet-not-a-lawyers.
