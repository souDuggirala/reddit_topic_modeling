  The decisions you make prior to an accient are the most important, it could save your life, your passengers and others outside of your vehicle. But what decision should you make? Is your vehicle at least covered for repairs if you drive off of the road to avoid a head-on collision with a vehicle speeding in your lane, going the wrong direction? What if your car is totaled as a result and the speeder drives off with no witnesses? Should everyone have a dash cam? What if the police are unable to catch the speeder but you recorded it on video with a clear shot of their license plate, will you get a new vehicle? In general, if your vehicle will be damaged whether you take action or no action, and you are assured that you will not be hurt in either case: Is it better to attempt at disabling the guilty driver so there's a lowered chance of them getting away or should you avoid the accident entirely so your decision isn't what hurt the guilty driver? Came across an interesting video of driving in snow, starts around the 5m 39.5s mark: (video links not allowed) - Is the driver covered for skidding in snow and hitting the bus instead of the pedestrian? I know there's likely far too many variables to give me conclusive advice of what to do, that's why the subject it titled 'general legal advice'. Thank you.
