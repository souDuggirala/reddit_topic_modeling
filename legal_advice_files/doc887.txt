 Back in the college I attended, I was on campus for about 10 months. Fire alarms only went off once. It was so quiet, that when I sat in my room, no music/TVs on ect. Just talking with some friends, we couldn't hear the alarm. Another kid was running down the halls opening doors and telling everyone. Even in the halls it wasn't super loud. I think my high school alarm was louder. I'm just wondering what laws(if any) exist for dorm fire saftey. I'm also curious about if security laws for college dorm halls exist. Laws about front door locks and keeping track of building personal and so on. Also if there are any laws about Residential Assistance and what they abilities should NOT include. Thanks legal advice of Reddit!!
