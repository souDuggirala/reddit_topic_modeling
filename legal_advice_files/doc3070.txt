 I just moved into a apartment and after me and my bf signed the lease we went and did a walkthrough with the assistant manager. First thing off the bat we saw the washer had mold in it, she took a picture of it and said maintence would come replace it. After she leaves and we put our concerns down like old tenants dog chewed on base boards and window stills she had left with the move out paper we were suppose to keep and said we had 5 days to make any changes. So we started to move our stuff in and I go to use the dishwasher and I open it and there is mold inside of it too, we also noticed the microwave still had food stuck to it along with the fridge. As we continue to move our stuff in as we were on a time crunch we also noticed what looked like dog fecal matter on our sliding glass door (There was dog hair by it) we stopped putting our stuff in and went to look for other things that were not cleaned. The toliet seat was worn down with the paint coming off and more fecal matter on it and urine caked on to the bottom of the lid. I am planning on doing a maintence request for the dishwasher and the washer and now for the toliet seat. We also discovered the toliet does not flush and our shower has little water pressure. I have a young child and do not want to expose my child to this. How long do they have to fix this issues and can I legally break the lease due to heath hazzards? Thank you for reading.
