 If you rent an apartment and your displaced because of a tree falling into your apartment, and the damage will be 6 months for the apartment building to be rebuilt. Is the landlord responsible to find us housing?  Please check for a condemnation clause in your lease. It should explain this.  If you are in the United States, every state allows for a lease to be dissolved in the event a property is damaged to a degree the home becomes uninhabitable unless major repair work is done. This is something your renter's insurance can help you bridge by providing money for a hotel or other accommodation while seeking a new place to live, some moving expenses and so on. A natural disaster or act of God only places liability on the landlord to help cover those costs if they were negligent and could reasonably foresee the events. It does not sound at all likely here.  You failed to provide your location as required in [the rules](), but without some specific clause in the lease generally a landlord's liability is limited to rent credit. I would fully expect with a six month repair schedule that the lease will be terminated and unless there is another unit available you will need to find another place to live.
