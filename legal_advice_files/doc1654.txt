 I have been playing under a certain underpass for years. There is an incredibly wide space between the road and the side of the underpass (maybe 20 feet) and I have never had a single complaint as this is in the middle of nowhere essentially. Sometimes cars stop and wave. Sometimes cops stop or wave. There is one cop who has decided to tell me that it's unsafe for me to be there and that I have to leave. I have asked him and no one has complained. He just says I cannot be there. Up until now I have respectfully left but I would like to know where I stand legally. I come here about once a month with my old beat up kit and let out some steam. Everyone seems to be ok with or even enjoy this including 50+ cops (maybe not individuals but driving by or interactions over the years and this one cop is not open to reasonable conversation. While remaining polite I would like to know my rights. Thanks in advance.  It depends on where you are and what kind of roadway youâ€™re alongside. Practically, if a cop tells you to move along, you should move along. Seriously, the side of the road is not the place to litigate the law with the cops.  It is a public space (not private property) and it is is not a safety issue as you are far away from the road. You have the right to sit there and be there doing what ever. The police officer is just being a tyrant. Be careful, cops don't like being told they are wrong.  No advice, I just wanted to say that sounds like a cool thing to drive by, someone having a good time and playing music for everyone with no agenda. Nice.
