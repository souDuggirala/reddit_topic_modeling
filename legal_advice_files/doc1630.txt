 I was pulled over tonight and was clocked at 68 mph in a 35 mph zone. I was questioned multiple times about being under the influence of alcohol or marijuana. I am 21 and have been pulled over quite a bit of times and have never been questioned even once about being under the influence. This is really beyond the point, but upon some research I read that if receiving a violation of 31+ mph over the speed limit a court appearance was necessary. The officer didn't mention anything about this to me and I don't believe my citation says anything about this on it. I haven't gotten a citation that has carried points in 2 years so I should have no points on my license, but this will bring me up to 5, only one from having my license suspended. I am wondering if I should plead not guilty in hopes of lower points and possibly a lower fine as both citations total $350. I read that if you plead not guilty that you have to post collateral equal to the fine and was wondering if this is true. Thank you for you responses now  If the judge asks you, then sure, but otherwise don’t bother. You were doing almost double the speed limit in that area. You’re lucky they didn’t arrest you and take your license.  Thanks for the amazing tip!! Just thought it would be some kind of explanation (or excuse whichever you want to use) as to why I was going so much over the speed limit.  : Forgot to mention I had just passed someone, I assume mentioning this at the case would be beneficial Because you think it's ok to speed 33 mph over if you're passing someone? Protip: it's not Title 75 section 3362 subsection A3, if that's what you meant What does the ticket actually say: statute you were cited under?
