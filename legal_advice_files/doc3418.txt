 Is there anything i can do about this? If you report your roommate for theft your insurance company may pay for the damages, but that would depend on what your policy covers.  You can sue your roommate for the damages. You can sue them if they refuse to pay for the damage they did. Whether they owe you the money or not is going to depend on whether they broke the transmission through misuse or negligence or something like that, or if the transmission was already dying and it just so happened to die while they were driving it through no misuse or negligence of their own. You haven't provided enough information to have much of an answer. Though ultimately that may depend on why the transmission failed. If it failed through misuse then you may indeed have a claim against your roommate for those damages. If the transmission failed as a result of age, improper maintenance, or just bad luck, then you may not.
