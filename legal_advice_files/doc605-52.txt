I’m a 19 year old nursing major in a four year university right now. Last night I got a citation for having less than a gram in my pocket that literally wasn’t mine; it was my friends who was there. My friend told the officer that it was hers, but I still received the citation and have to appear in court. The officer said my friend can appear in court with me and say that the weed was theirs. What is the probable outcome of this? I live in North Carolina and I can’t have anything on my record to get accepted into my schools nursing program in Jan of 2020. I’ve never gotten in trouble before.  There are plenty of people in prison for drugs that “weren’t theirs”.  You need an attorney. Cops don’t care who owns the weed, just who is carrying it. Unless something happens, this will probably end poorly for you. thank you, most definitely will do.  Get an attorney, no one can say how things might go.  Having it in your pocket is likely sufficient to convict you of possession, even if a friend is willing to confess to a crime in court to try and save you (which a judge is going to be hesitant to allow unless that person has their own attorney who will of course tell them not to do it).  Seriously, attorney, now.
