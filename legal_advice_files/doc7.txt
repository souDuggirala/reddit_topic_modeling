 Hello, I 'm currently renting a rent-stabilized apartment in NYC, the lease expires and of November 2019. The owner sent the renewal documents this week dated June 28th with a deadline to return an answer within 60 days. The deadline is past due the moment I got them. I called them and they said it's not a problem if I want to renew the lease, they told me to just sign and sent the docs back. Is it fine? If I sign and send the docs can they say you signed after the 60 days period and kick me out? They said it's not a problem. Do you have a legal question?
