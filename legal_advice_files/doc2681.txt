 How do I figure out if I've been signed off my father's will or will receive his life insurance. I don't know if recieving life insurance is even the right words. But I have a feeling my aunt has dismantled or stopped paying into his life insurance and likely managed to get my father to sign me off on his will. My father has dimentia and can't do it himself. And I don't know a reliable family member I can ask about the status of his will or life insurance. My family is also floating on collecting part of his social security because he decided to retire and not pay child support, so we cannot afford a lawyer. Also my mom has this belief that I can continue to collect so I'll security until I'm 22 or 23. I'm 17 and a lot of people say it just ends when I'm 18. I'm going to University this coming call of 2019 and will be taking on student loans. And I just really screwed and will stop recieving anything at 18 or does it extent to 22 / 23. Is there nothing to do if my dad wrote me off his will?  I am not disabled. I'm Just about to have no income to pay for anything like say my house besides a 12 hours of a minimum wage job which will be on pause during uni. They do a redetermination at 18 to see if you're still disabled. You need to contact the Social Security office to find out about your status and what to do next. If your dad wrote you out of his will there isn't anything you can do.
