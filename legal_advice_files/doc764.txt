 I [M17] have a job and can't always go see my dad 3 hours away when I'm scheduled to, and sometimes with low hours I'm not being paid enough right now to use the gas to go see him especially after my numourous choir events. I have to pay for trip payments for school and insurance so I barely have enough gas money to see him regularly. He just threatened my mom that if I can't go see him hes going to stop paying support not just for me but also my little sister. Is there anything I can do, can he really just up and do that because I'm almost a functioning adult and he doesn't want to accept that?  [removed] No, he can't do that. If he thinks he can. he'll be in big trouble pretty soon. Donâ€™t use your own gas to visit your father. If these visits are mandated, then either your mom will have to drive you or he will have to pick you up depending on their custody agreement. He cannot decide to stop paying child support, and if he does then it is up to your mom to take him back to court.  At 17 it's likely you don't have to go see him anymore if you express an unwillingness during a hearing over his lack of payment. He'll complain you don't come and the judge will most likely tell him to organize transportation for you or suck eggs alone while continuing to pay support until his obligation ends.  No. He can't. If he does he will go to jail. Ignore his tantrum or work something out for him to buy your gas.
