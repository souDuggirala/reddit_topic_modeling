 I know there are many of you out there facing this same issue. My case was dismissed and expunged shortly thereafter in 2016 in CHICAGO, IL. However, the second website that shows up when you google my name is this extortion scam website called [RapSheets.Org]() which keeps your mugshots available regardless of the outcome of the case. From what I have found, although it is a scam, it is legal and the only way to remove it is by paying them. I am reluctant to enter more information into their website though. Anyone have any knowledge about this or knows how to successfully and safely get this removed?  I looked into Search Engine optimization but all I could find was monthly subscriptions that were too expensive (like $100/month was the cheapest I found). However, I did just google my name and rapsheets.org did not show up on the first 2 pages. wooo. maybe someone fixed it. I did find another potentially shitty site called mylife.com . Looks like you can still find that stuff as long as you generate a report and click 'I promise not to use this for employment etc' but I didnt do the final step of generating the report in case that would end up popping at the top of the search,. Did you ever get this figured out? It would be pretty funny if their mugshots were included on their own site...
