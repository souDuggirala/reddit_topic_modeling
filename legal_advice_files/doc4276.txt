 Little backstory here- was being a stupid kid and went to the shooting range near a friends house. Sign at range said from dawn to dusk are the hours. When we got there it was dark out already and i had my car pulled up with the lights on due to us unloading the guns from the car. My guns were out with no ammunition in them and we were deciding on shooting or leaving because of the little light. Then a game warden came down asked for my license to make sure I had a hunters permit ( required for the range). He then went into a shed of some sort .I would guess there was a computer inside. He then said "you are fine as long as your have your license now get out of here". The game warden was very cool about everything especially since we didn't shoot. Then two weeks later i got a citation in the mail for not following range instructions posted on the sign and being on an unauthorized road. The fine is $300. I am a broke college student who lives far away. Is there anyway I could fight this or would it be better to move on and pay the fine?  Well what were the range instructions?
