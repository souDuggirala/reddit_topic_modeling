 Let me start this with my fiancé and I don’t smoke. I simply don’t have time to be stopped. Quick back story my parents split and now they are both so sick so we drove my sister from Florida to Colorado to care for mom while I stay in Florida to care for dad. Dad has surgery Tuesday morning and I can’t afford to be late. I’ve never missed an appointment or procedure, if we are simply leaving Colorado and we know we are driving the speed limit and using signals when appropriate we shouldn’t have a problem driving through Kansas correct? Just extra info it’ll just be two of us in the car, newer hatchback, seatbelts of course, and nothing blocking any parts of the windshield, windows, or mirrors. If we get pulled over what is my best course of action knowing that we won’t be breaking any laws? There is nothing special about driving through Kansas. Your post makes no sense.  My fiancé is an aviation mechanic and he is careful with everything so we just check everything but mostly my issue is time constraints. My cousin I guess got pulled over in Kansas now granted I think she was doing something wrong but I’m not sure. I just can’t spare the time What's so special about Kansas?
