Hello everyone,
I am in a community where we discuss a series we all like and other stuff like theory’s, Games and more.

On my last discussions two people showed up, who actually made usage of „bad words“/bullying and after another user started to defend me, one started to also attack her.
Their Textes became very weird.
They used the name of guns, I didn’t understand what they were saying at the end. I heard those two got banned sometime before.

I am sometimes making discussions and theory’s. And they actually attacked me, because they don’t like the stuff.

I don’t know those two or had contact with them before.

The people always showed me that they were interested in my posts, so I actually have never annoyed anyone.

My Questions are
1. They never showed up before, but somehow they made clear that they will attack my next posts as well, so is this actually bullying?

2. Which law actually is active here? I mean, i am living in a different country where this network is working and it is also not certain if they are living in this country. So the law of which country actually counts? The law of the country where this Network operates?.

I hope you can help me.
Thanks.

 Is the thread perhaps in the wrong section? I have done it, thanks.
