 My sister put her baby daddy on child support and has a court date coming up. The baby daddy was never been served but he's aware that she put him on child support. Does he still have to show up to the hearing? And does it make her look bad if she has him watch the kids so she can go to the hearing? I live in Texas. If he hasn't been served and he doesn't show to the court date, the case can't move forward.
