 Long story short, my wife's uncle had his mother add him as an authorized user to her bank account months ago. I think he also has power of attorney (which may have been deceptively done). Today, a representative from the bank and a police officer showed up to her house asking questions about her account. I don't have specifics, but I would imagine it has to do with large withdraws. She denied everything because its her son. She is definitely going senile though and we don't believe she fully understands whats going on. The son is a drug addict, con man who has been in and out of trouble his whole life. Just looking for advice as to what recourse my wife, her sister and her dad have if the uncle has all the power and the grandmother really doesn't understand? Thanks
