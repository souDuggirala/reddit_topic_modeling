My downstairs neighbor insists in sending her grandchildren to play on the garage, which is strictly prohibited in the rules of my condominium.

I care because
1- the kids play unsupervised the majority of the time, which is dangerous. 2- the garage is right under my window so there's a lot of noise which prevents me from working or studying at peace.

Manager says he "doesn't believe in taking extreme actions such as fining" and that he already talked to her and she claimed to have stopped. I then start to make videos to prove that she hasn't and send them to the manager via WhatsApp.

He is now ignoring my calls and messages.

What do I do? 

I'm in Brazil, and I understand most people here won't know Brazilian law but I'm wondering if, in general, this is worth fighting for.
