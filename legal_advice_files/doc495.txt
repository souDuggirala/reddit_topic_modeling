 I was in an accident in which I was driving in snowy weather. Though driving very slowly because of the conditions, I still hit an ice patch and clipped the back of a car going the other direction. Despite the determination that there was no negligence or recklessness, I have been determined to be at fault because I always could have been going even slower, understandable. My insurance is able to cover all the damages despite both cars being totalled and there were no injuries. The other party is not satisfied with being paid the blue book value and told my insurance that they want to sue for a brand new car. Do they have a case considering the circumstances of the accident? u/wild_b_cat is exactly right. This is not your problem and you shouldn't have anything to worry about. This will be handled by your insurance company, and the equation for determining the value of a car and whether or not it is totaled is simple and widely accepted as the standard. Do yourself a favor and don't stress about it! Good luck! No. The causes of the accident are irrelevant - they are owed the value of their car and nothing more. If they are asking for more just because, they will lose. If they are asking for a higher blue book value, though, then they might have a better chance, depending on if they can truly justify it. Regardless, the path forward for you is the same: if they reject your insurance's offer, they will need to sue you personally, and then your insurance will provide a lawyer to defend you and pay any judgments on your behalf.
