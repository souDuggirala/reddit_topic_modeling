 I received a notice from DMV a few days ago that my insurance company (former: Progressive, current: Geico) reported a lapse in my policy. I didn't renew my policy with Progressive and instead started a policy with Geico after 18 days. The grace period is 14 days. During this period I did not drive my car as I didn't have a job and thus didn't have the need to. I'm wondering if this as well as the short lapse period (4 days more than the grace period) would be good grounds for appealing the $200 fine. I would also be interested in knowing how your experience was with scheduling a court hearing to contest the fine. Thank you in advance! Yep. Reading is difficult for me this morning.  There was a lapse. It was 18 days. Any documentation showing that there wasn’t a lapse and explaining the discrepancy would be worth sharing with the court to get the fine reduced or waived. Contact the court clerk to ask about the process of appealing this fine.  Unfortunately, in my state none of that matters if you didn’t turn your tags in to the DMV. In my state it’s immediately after the first day withkut insurance you get a $150 fine. Basically, as long as you have tags you need insurance or else we must turn our tags in. However, asking and hopefully getting a friendly person at the DMV will help you out. Good luck mate
