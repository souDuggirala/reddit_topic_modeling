 Little background, my fiancee was 18 coming out of high school and was living at home and her mother is living in her grandmother's house when her grandfather passes away. Fast forward a few months, her grandma moves away but leaves the house in the hands of my future MIL. She cant put the house in MIL name or my fiancees because MIL has terrible credit and fiancee bc she had too little credit. So she payed my grandmother monthly who payed the mortgage but the electricity had to go in my fiancees. Not to say that my fiancee was "forced" but if she wanted to live in a house with power that was the only option. She apparently missed a few payments and phone calls from collections and frankly I'm pissed. I'm pretty sure we're screwed as it is in her name, but I figured I'd give reddit an ask before I just start paying it myself because she's not good for the payments. Thank you for the input. Much appreciated.  Gotcha. Thanks for the input I figured as much.  Unfortunately she's stuck with this from what you've said. She was a legal adult and knew about / authorized the account. Your fiancee will take the hit for this. paid ("payed" is what you did to your wooden-hulled ship) 'm pretty sure we're screwed as it is in her name Yes. She can sue FMIL but that's blood-from-a-stone territory. If fianc√© never knew about it, then she could tell police. But she knew. Sorry.
