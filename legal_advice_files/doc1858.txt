 So, not me, but the SIL has an issue with her children's father. They are legally separated, with him owing child support that he does not pay. She still owes money to her lawyer, that she is making payments to, for taking him to court for beating/neglecting their children. (The court ruled in his favor so nothing was done to resolve that issue, but whatever) So she cannot afford to hire a lawyer to go after him for what he owes her. Is there another way to compel him to pay her what he owes? I'm completely unfamiliar with how all this works, but I love my niece and nephew and want them cared for. Any help would be appreciated.  Awesome, thank you so much. [removed] The state will collect from him and send her a check. Also if there is ever a major change in circumstance the child support enforcement agency can re-evaluate child support.  I just found the website and sent it to her. She didnt know about it. Her lawyer said she had to go through him to get anything done. What an ass. Go to your county’s child support enforcement office with the court order. Most cases it’ll cost you $20 they may waive that. They will track him down and seek garnishment etc.
