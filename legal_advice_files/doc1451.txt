 My cousin's co-worker is working legally in the US on a green card (moved here with her parents). The company's HR sent an email to every employee at that branch stating that: 1) The co-worker is not a citizen 2) Her green card is about to expire The co-worker's green card is in the process of being renewed, (and will be renewed before the old one expires) and is at no risk of being deported. Did the company do anything illegal by releasing this information to all the employees? People may not be aware but even if the card expired, the Permanent Residence hasnâ€™t expired. An expired Green Card is only a problem if you are outside the US or need to access some government benefit. Even if your green card is expired, you have no chance of being deported. I wonder if the workplace does the same for those who used a drivers license to fill out their I9 and are close to it expiring? There might a case for harassment if there are other actions or if employment was threatened. For sure HR needs education. Im not a lawyer but here is a lawyer verifying what I have said: http://www.shipmangoodwin.com/mobile/showpublication.aspx?Show=6524  Sounds like the company stated nothing but the facts.  Sounds like somebody hit the wrong send button...
