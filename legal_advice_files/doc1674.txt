 Hey guys! So I got an email saying my credit score dropped I went to check it out and it says I recently opened a chase account that my payment is 30 days late. I know I do not have a chase credit card, what do I do now? Contact chase or my current credit card holder? Who do you report this too. I couldnâ€™t find a flair for this.  Your current card holder has nothing to do with this if they're not Chase. Contact Chase, then dispute the account on your credit report with the bureaus. Start with calling tbe credit company, whcihever one it is. They may mistaken your identity. If they can verify it is you, preferably by some old loan you can confirm is yours then it is time to freeze your credit, contact the police and file a report of identity theft. You can then call Chase and try to get the account closed. If they can't verify it is you, it is likely the credit company done effed up and you will need to take a few weeks - years to get it removed from your report. Contact the credit bureau. If you go to www.annualcreditreport.com you can see all 3 bureaus. They have dispute forms available there, too. You won't see your scores (unless you pay for them), but everything that's reporting will be there. When I worked in banking, this was the only site we recommended besides each bureau's independent site. Good luck! What a crappy situation. I'm sorry this happened to you.
