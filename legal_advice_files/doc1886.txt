 For some context, a friend of mine sent me a gift last year. Due to circumstances our relationship has faulted. He now wishes for it back. He has the receipt for the item, however as I see it he gave me the item therefore it belongs to me. I have offered to pay for the item but he has declined. What can I do in this situation? I am prepared to give it back if needed. My apologies for the short explanation. I am unsure what other information I need. The person above you is not giving legal advice and, honestly, doesn't sound like they know what they are talking about. I will give it back to him if needed, but the household makes good use of it. They would certainly be upset without it. I know it is particularly stubborn of me of course, but I suppose the items means a lot to some and little to others. I do not mean to imply anything of course. No takesies backsies for gifts. You CAN give it back if you WANT. But you arent under ahy obligation to do so Imo, just give it back to him to avoid any more headache, lol. As long as it was a gift, given without any expectation of return favor or obligation. Such as a birthday gift or just a friendship gift. Then you are under no legal obligation to return it or pay for it.  The item cost around Â£150. It was just a gift from a friend I suppose. It wasn't a special occasion. What is it? How much is it worth? Under what circumstance was it given to you?
