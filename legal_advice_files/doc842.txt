 Hello, I hope everyone is well. I have run into some cash flow problems with my business, as we have had to take several unexpected costs all in one month and therefore do not have the cash to hand to pay for them as the business has been closed for several weeks so there has been no revenue. I need around £4000 to pay off the costs, which I cannot provide through my own savings or from friends and family loans. For other reasons, I am reluctant to get a business loan. I am confident that this is a short term issue, and the costs can easily be paid off within a few months of the business trading, however, the main issue is a lack of cash at this very moment. I have thought about applying for 0% credit card (which I am eligible for) and making a payment to the business using the card to pay for the costs (or a significant part of it, depending on the credit limit). However, I am concerned that this may have negative repercussions that I am not aware of, so I would like some advice on if I am missing something. To clarify how this would work, I would charge the credit card to the business online payment processor and when the funds have cleared into the business bank account, I would withdraw the cash to pay for the required services. Once the business is trading again, I will begin making immediate monthly payments to repay the credit card. For argument's sake, let's assume that I will be accepted for the credit card, the business costs will be paid, the card is repaid within the 0% time limit. Am I missing anything out? ​ If this is not the correct subreddit for this question, please advise as to where to ask.
