 Ok first of all I don’t need anyone coming at me telling me I shouldn’t have sent nudes to someone because I KNOW!!!!!! I know revenge porn is now illegal in Scotland and I’ve had a huge falling out with this guy I was speaking to. I have quite a high profile career path and it’s one he particularly disagrees with and I’m TERRIFIED he will leak my nudes at some point in the future which would risk everything I have. They were all sent on snapchat and he never screenshotted but I’m scared he maybe took photos on another device. I want to know if there is any way I could have his phone searched and anything deleted without him actually ever threatening to do it. If not, general advice on how to deal with the situation if it ever arises would be hugely appreciated, thank you.  Have you considered reaching out to him? If you are a victim I wouldn’t worry too much. Society is generally very sympathetic to victims and you will be supported no matter what happens and no matter what your career path is. This is unfortunately very common. The best way to avoid it is obviously not to take nudes, which can rot and corrupt a guys brain. I would reach out to him and get some reassurance that they will be deleted because his career will also be at risk if anything happens and he will end up regretting it for the rest of his life and it won’t be worth it. /r/legaladviceuk If the crime has not taken place or a threat, you can't do anything at the moment besides make sure that this doesn't happen again with another guy. Best of luck
