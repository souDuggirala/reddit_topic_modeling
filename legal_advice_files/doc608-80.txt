About 3 months ago the police came to my doorstep and told my parents that there was a package in my name seized by homeland security containing drugs. They said that they have no intention to charge me but there is a case open and they are asking me very specific questions (whether I used Tor, seller info, other purchases, etc.). There doesn't seem to be any evidence suggesting that I purchased anything, other than the fact that it was intended to be shipped to me. I did not receive or sign for the package.

I'm wondering what the best course of action should be for me. Should I answer their questions or get a lawyer? If I answer them what would be the best way to reply?  

I am currently out of the country so they can't talk to me in person. They want to talk to me over email- should I respond? I never received any letter and like I said I never got  the package (they said it was almost a year ago when it was intercepted). Would really just like some advice with what to do or what is going on. Lawyer, now. Do not talk to them "under advice of my attorney." You should never speak to police who may even potentially be investigating you without an attorney. This includes customs, the DEA, Homeland Security, etc. You are under no legal obligation to speak with the authorities unless arrested, and even then, only under the guidance of your attorney.

And that's what you should do: not speak to anyone about this, and if arrested, retain an attorney. Under no circumstance should you talk to the police. Of you are charged with anything, retain a lawyer.
