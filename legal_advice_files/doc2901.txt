 As of today, Feb 13th, I still haven't received my w2 from one employer. I emailed them yesterday asking how to go about getting it. The director (it's a daycare) responds saying they've had it there and I can come pick it up whenever. I go to the center today and the director tells me she put it in the mail yesterday and also tried saying she called me and left a voicemail about it. I never received any calls or messages from the daycare. I know I have to wait until the 15th to contact the IRS about my w2. From what I've read I would need my last paystub to report information, however, I never once received a paystub from this company. They had an online site for that information which I was never given access to. Hopefully my w2 comes in this week. My question is, can I report the company to the IRS for not mailing my w2 by Jan 31st? With the way the director is playing these petty games I'm hoping there's some way to get them in trouble for this? TIA. I asked for access while I was still employed there but the owner never gave me the information. I actually needed the information to rent an apartment but luckily the owner accepted bank statements instead of paystubs. Did you ask for instructions on how to access the web site? You don't have to be given a paper pay stub.
