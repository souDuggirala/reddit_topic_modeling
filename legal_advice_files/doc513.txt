 Please excuse any formatting issues, this is my first time posting and I'm on mobile. Please also let me know if this isn't the correct place to post this. I don't want to post too many details in case someone involved is on Reddit, so I created a throwaway account for it. Last year I was in a situation where I filed a complaint of assault on someone (police were not called as he did not actually touch me, but got as close as possible to it without actually touching. He got kicked out of the courthouse we were in). I filed a police report and filed an assault complaint at the courthouse. There was a hearing (long story but I went on a different day than he did). The person at the hearing told me there was enough evidence to charge him, but instead I had the court employees speak to him and give him a "come to Jesus talk" (their words, not mine). If he behaved well and seemed to understand that what he did was wrong and that he couldn't do it again, no charges would be filed. If he was disrespectful or rude or didn't seem to understand that what he did was wrong, they would charge him. And if they didn't charge him but he assaulted me again in the next six months, they would automatically charge him with the original assault.If anyone needs more details of this decision, please let me know. He ended up not getting charged and it was all dropped. This was in Massachusetts btw. My question is, since he was never officially charged, is there any record of this that might show up on his criminal record? Or is it as if nothing ever happened because I didn't have him officially charged?
