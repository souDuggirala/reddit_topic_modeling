 Oregon. August 2017 I traded in a car to a car dealership for credit on a new car. November 2017, I get an impound notice. Some guy was pulled over for drunk driving and no licence or insurance, and the car is still in my name. Tow yard says I can come get it. I do not remember if I signed a bill of sale, or release of liability. The only copy in my car buying packet that is somewhat like this is a power of attorney to disclose odometer- signed over to dealership. I thought the dealership would take care of everything, so I never notified dmv of the sale. I had the car for 10 years, and never actually wanted to give it up, so I want to pay the tow yard and pick it up. Especially since the tow guy made it sound like it would get crushed if I don't pick it up. BUT, I wonder if there would be legal repercussions from that. I no longer have the title. Could I just apply for a lost title? DMV was not much help except to say it is registered in my name. And it has a dealership stock flag on it (flag 10). They just kept repeating that they cannot give me legal advice. Can anyone give me some advice here? It's an odd situation for sure, but if the true owners ever come looking for it with proof that they purchased it from you but just maybe screwed up the paperwork, don't expect that it can't end badly for you. If I'm still the registered owner, and no one else is claiming it, what prevents me from not just owning it again? I found and spoke with the guy who got caught driving it with DUI. He is not going to go get it, nor would it even be possible for him to- no license, insurance, no bill of sale, no title, etc.  [removed] You certainly can't just re-own the car. I am not sure what to tell you. You can pay to take it out of the pound but you may lose the car and that money.
