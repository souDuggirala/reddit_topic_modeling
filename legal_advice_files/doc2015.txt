 I work in fast food and make slightly above minimum wage and I am considered a "lower manager rank". I was given a high raise 2 months ago and I didn't realize that I wasn't being payed correctly until now. I decided to talk to my GM but she claimed her side was correct and if they found anything she would only give me a month of pay back, but the thing is, it is correct and I need the full 2 months amount because I need the money. Is there anything I can do here? You can report this to your state’s labor commission (if you’re in the US) or equivalent in your country. Evidence would help your case.  Talk to them about why you believe one thing and they believe another. Talk to HR.  Can you prove you were given this raise? Do you have documentation of what your new pay rate should be?
