 December 7th I ordered a coat from a US based website that advertises free worldwide shipping in 7 to 12 days. I finally received a tracking number on the 13th. I've been checking every few days and the tracking info just lists it leaving 5 parcel centers in China and arriving at a 6th. The info is updated approximately once a week or every 10 days. My question is, should I keep waiting and if so, for how long? Should I go to my bank and see about a chargeback? I've tried reaching out to the company online and I get no response. After doing my research I see that this is a known problem, but I was dumb and didn't do that first. I'm just not sure how to proceed. Given that it’s coming from China and you selected free shipping, it’s probably not going to be expedited and it most definitely isn’t going to take 7-12 days. Give it another couple weeks.
