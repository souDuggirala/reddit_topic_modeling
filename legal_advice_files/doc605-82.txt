Soooo, I was served papers to be summoned by a loan place I borrowed money from a while ago. Court Date is tomorrow afternoon and now I've choosen the great time of freaking out about it as I nearly done nothing to really prep for this.

Well, not exactly nothing, I already spoke to collection agency of said debtor &amp; signed an agreement to make a payment towards the debt which I already started on. But now second guessing on if there's a gotcha surprise that could catch me as I go to court like "AH HA PAY US MOAR MONIES" or if since I made this arrangement if I need to even show up (which I still may take the trouble to go to anyways just to be safe).

Just hoping this is a straight forward process that puts them at bay, also semi-worried if this or said agreement I mindlessly signed to &amp; started paying on will clog up things if I ever decide to consolidate this with my other debts.
