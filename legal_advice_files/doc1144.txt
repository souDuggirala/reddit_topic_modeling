 Hi so, I don't know if this belongs here or not but as I was laying in bed Wednesday night the post broke through the floor on the trailer I am renting. It caused me to get a shoulder injury when I hit the wall, I decided to crawl under the trailer to discover the floor is flake board supported solely by one 2X4 in the center of the room. Just wondering if I had any legal recourse when it comes to the injury or him trying to keep the deposit when I leave  Sorry! Edited it into the end of this post, am new to this  You need to say where you are (country, and if USA then state) for us to have any useful response.
