 My partner is worried about ownership rights (50%) on the investment and if our equity will stand in australia court in case something goes wrong. I would assume that no matter what, we will own 50% of the company anywhere given our terms of agreement, but i just want to get some thoughts here. Also, anything we should be worried about? We have a US lawyer, should we get an australian lawyer too? Maybe the US lawyer and Australian lawyer can communicate with eachother, but i think an australian lawyer might be unnecessary.  Ok ty Yeah Australia will generally honour contracts and does not ban foreign investment (assuming you are talking about something mundane, not like a uranium mine or the national telecomm network), but you should absolutely get a local lawyer as there will be all kinds of wrinkles that you don't anticipate. I am a Canadian with an relatively simple Ohio LLC and I doubt I could have figured that out properly without a local lawyer.
