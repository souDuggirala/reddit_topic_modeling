 The owner has video proof of 4 men(us) jumping nearby the car(not actually doing damage,It seems,that's what he told to the party organizers),if the owner presses charges, people who were at the party can identify us but can't say we were the ones who damaged the car. We don't have a lot of money and we think the money the owner asked is too much for what we actually damaged(2,3k€). should we try to reach an agreement to refund(which would make us automatically guilty if the negotiation fails) or let him press charges and hope for the best? If we lose in court we might have to pay even more than the refund he asked 2.300€ vs Lawyer fees (15.000€ each, because your "friends"are going to drop each other like hot turds) Fines Reimbursement of damages (2.300€) Loss of revenue from having a criminal record Pay the guy for \everything\ (even though you only broke the mirrors), appologise, and thank him on your bare knees for not pressing charges.  Someone biked into the back of my car and this small deep scratch costs 475 euros to repair. So scratched doors cost way more. Luckily in my case the insurance of the other party covers it. So be happy 2300 seems fair BTW this is a 2007 twingo  I know i will have to pay,but i want to pay what i actually broke You brought this on yourself. Consider this as a life lesson, don't vandalize other people's property. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. That's cheap. There's a lot of work involved with fixing scratches on cars, esp when deeper. 2300 for 2 side mirrors(what we damaged),2 front Doors that were scratched(what we didn't do),and One scratched rear door(that we also didn't damage) on a 2015 Clio,the front of which was already damaged as It had an incident. 2300 is pretty cheap for damage to a car. You didn't lost what damage was done. Edit: if you intentionally vandalized the vehicle you may be looking at criminal charges as well
