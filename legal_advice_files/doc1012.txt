 So my brother attends Rutgers University in New Jersey and the cost of the college health insurance plan has increased 300 dollars for this semester. It was 900 last semester and it's 1250 this semester. We did not receive notification of this increase and the reason prior to being billed for it. Are universities who offer the insurance legally required to notify the student/family of the changes and the reason why? Can we legally force the school to provide a detailed explanation of the increase besides the blanket "our premium went up"? Thank you! Thank you so much. We checked but I guess we both missed that part He should go through his documentation. For school insurance, it's pretty common for the insurance for the breakdown to be uneven, because the Spring premium covers some/all of the summer months as well
