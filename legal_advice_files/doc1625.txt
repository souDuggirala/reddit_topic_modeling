 I’m posting to see if I have any legal ground on what is currently happening to me. I’ve been on a 6 month contract and have been having a hard time keeping a trainer who can adhere to my schedule. My old trainer just stopped messaging me and I was informed her schedule changed without my notice. Im currently trying to get a new trainer but so far it’s radio silence from the gym about scheduling, I’m being told I will be “contacted” but it has been four days. Are they in breach if I am paying for a service I am not receiving? My contract is nearly up but I still have sessions I want honored.
