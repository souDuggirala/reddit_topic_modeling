 I bought a motorcycle without a title yesterday from Jay. Jay bought it from Steve with out a title. Steve is the registered owner in the dmv system. I went to the dmv and they gave me a application for duplicate title that steve has to fill out with his DL # address etcetc. I got in contact with steve and during the call he was cooperative and kind. After the dmv gave me the form I called him and he is absolutely refusing to sign it over for whatever reason. I have a bill of sale from steve to jay, and from jay to me. What are my options?
