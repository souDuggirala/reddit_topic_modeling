 ^((I've done my market research, business plan and built a strong business model. I have thoroughly researched every aspect of the market I'm launching myself into but only dabbled in the legal aspect of it. My parents are very supportive of me doing it.)) Here are my questions: As a minor, what would be my best option to open this said business? Should I have it under my parent's names, is it possible for me to even open a business at my age \[16\] in Canada, and would Sole Proprietorship be a good starting structure to start with. On top of all that, under my jurisdiction, do I even need a legal structure to operate a fairly small business? (I am dealing with small retailers and the web store is to be open soon.) Thanks. Thank you I really appreciate it Yes that's right. Definitely not. That's for HST correct? You don't need to register anything if you are operating under your own name. Will you be making more than $30K/year? Would I be able to register my business as a sole proprietorship for my age? It really depends what you are trying to do but if it's relatively simple you don't need an entity you can just operate as a sole proprietorship.
