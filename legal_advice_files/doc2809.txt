 got my first ticket in 15 years. got pull over for 50 over 40. the officer said it was more 53/40. however i cannot imagine me going that fast as I was approaching to a left turn intersection. when I got back and look at the map, I found from where the officer's car parked (right before he started following me), he cannot see the street I was driving because of building obstruction. So I am wondering if I can win this case if going to court or at least see the evidence of it. The point at which the cop started following you is not necessarily the point at which he lasered you. Can you mock up a shitty MS Paint diagram? I do know when we was stationary and started following me. And that is a point where he cannot see the street I was driving at. The only way he can tag me is by stopping I. The middle of the intersection, where I am 100% sure he was not at. By the way there were 2 other police cars already ticketing people they pulled over on the same street.  Do you know the exact spot that the cop lasered you at? not trying to be a jerk to argue a ticket. I am very curious how he got my speed with laser as he cannot see me. It'a about finding out did I did it or not. I understand and will definite not waste my time on fighting it if i indeed was speeding. With all due respect it might be for the better to just pay the ticket as going to court could take time and it might not be beneficial for you in the end. Paying the ticket is probably the better option.
