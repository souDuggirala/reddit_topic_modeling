 I’m a gay guy (17) and I have a boyfriend (16). I live in texas, and I turn 18 in March while he turns 17 in May. If we tried anything, would I be considered a sex offender? They do in some places, but not in Texas.  Didn't realize the couple was gay. Romeo and Juliet laws do not apply to same sex couples. I don’t think those laws protect same-sex couples Texas has a Romeo and Juliet provision in the law. If both parties are over 14 years of age and within 3yrs if age, consensual sexual relationships is not statutory rape. The Romeo and Juliet provision does not apply to same sex relationships. If you are 18 and your boyfriend is 17, you are find. But like the other poster said, no nude photos. Age of consent in TX is 17 so hold off until he turns that age -- and no nude pic swapping until both 18 (don't trigger child porn laws).
