  i live in ca. i want to make a living trust, put my two sons on.... i’ve lived in my house for 40 years Will my property taxes on my house change? making a living trust with my children ss beneficiaries  Thank you. That’s helps.  If it’s a revocable trust, and you’re the current beneficiary, then no. But after that it gets complicated- working with a lawyer is the best advice.
