 My cousin was arrested for 75 counts of CP, and we are worried he will try to plead mental instability and get out of jail sooner. He has an “intellectual disability”. He waived his right to a preliminary, whatever that means and has an Arraignment on the 28th. I have a copy of his case details because they are public information in my state (Wisconsin), but I am not sure if this subs rules allow me to link it. If someone can clarify for me whether I am allowed to link it, I will so you guys can see what I am looking at. So what will happen in terms of his sentence if he pleads that way? When does he make his plea either way? Before or after the Arraignment? I would prefer him to stay in jail forever.
