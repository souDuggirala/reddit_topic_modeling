 So in the EU a new article will be passed called article 13 which threatens our fair use barriers and has the potential to cut social media platforms because the company is held accountable for all the copyright in it and content id is not enough according to the article. My question is how do we stop this? This will not directly affect me but indirectly the companies in the US might mirror the EUs moves. What is the best way to stop this?
