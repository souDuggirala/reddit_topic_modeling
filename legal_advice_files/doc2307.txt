 I work at Domino's and we often have a large volume of delivery orders. Every now and again a driver will forget their receipt and won't realize it until too late. If the driver has a customer sign a piece of paper detailing the charges and tip and me as a manager reprints the receipt and forges the tip (writing in the tip total and signature to match the customers) would it still be illegal even if i don't buff up the tip and match it perfectly? Texas requires intent to harm or defraud before forgery is a crime. It certainly poses a risk of facts being interpreted against you, but it's not a crime yet, assuming the facts stated are interpreted as such.  Texas defines forgery as falsely authenticating a writing purporting to be executed by another without authorization. Under the UCC, authorization has to be explicit for a signature at another's direction. You can't just replicate a signature. So it's technically forgery. However, forgery does not become a crime without the intent to defraud or harm another. So it's not illegal forgery assuming all facts are interpreted in his favor, since you're not padding the amount. However still, it's a dangerous and unnecessary game to play because who's to say it will be interpreted that way? A forged signature won't look good in any light if this issue is ever pressed. He could perhaps make a note on the line that the signature is on another document. Signatures generally aren't checked against anything unless the transaction is disputed, so there's no reason for him to put himself at risk like that.   Your manager should NOT be signing the receipt - this is forgery and VERY illegal. Rather, he should simply attach (staple) the 'piece of paper detailing the charges and tip' that the customer signed to the reprinted receipt. Tips can be added in manually using the customer's written amount on whatever paper you give him and his signature. Your manager forging signatures is just asking to see the inside of a jail cell.
