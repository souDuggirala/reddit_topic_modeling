 The winter storm that just passed through dropped my neighbors tree branches into my yard. It took down my power lines, yanked down my meter box, and damaged the side of my house. The tree is still alive. When I contacted my home owner's they said my neighbor is liable. When I contacted my neighbor's insurance, they said I'm liable. Obviously, I want .y neighbor's policy to cover these damages as it's not my tree and I'm going to need quite a bit of work done. Who is liable for these damages in Illinois, Lake County, Village of Deerfield, me or my neighbor?  Nobody. A storm is an act of nature. You can make a claim with your homeowner's insurance. In most states, if your tree or any part of it falls on your neighbors’ property and causes damage to their property through no fault of your own (due to a snow storm, winds, hurricane, or another so-called “act of God”), you are not responsible. If, however, the tree that you own, or a branch from it, fell as a result of your negligence (for example, an overhanging branch had been dead for years and your neighbors had been complaining about it for nearly as long but you neglected to have it cut down), you are liable.  The tree branches came down due to an act of God by your description. Your nieghbor is not responsible for acts of God. Your policy should cover this. I don't know for what reason your carrier would believe it's your nieghbors liability. Unless you had previously put the neighbor on notice that the branches were dead or diseased, you are almost certainly liable.
