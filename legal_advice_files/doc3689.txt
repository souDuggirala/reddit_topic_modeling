 To make a long story a short one... DHL delivered a package to an empty house and ‘somebody’ signed for it with a good guess on the driver simply taking it himself as the signature made no sense. Upon getting home obviously the package isn’t there. After a long back and forth with DHL and escalations they agree to mark the package as lost (via email). The seller then contacts DHL to confirm my story and in DHL’s infinite incompetence tell them it was successfully delivered, so the seller is refusing to do anything. A month later, cherry on top, I get a bill from DHL for duty. Any advice what to do at this point? Did you forward your email from DHL to the seller that the item was lost in the mail? (Notifying admission) — So you can get a refund if you are entitled. Contact Canada Border Services Agency, there should be a dispute form on their website.
