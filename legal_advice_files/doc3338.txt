 OK, interesting. Most courts in Europe would agree with that and at least partly acknowledge the cost. However: The "punitive damage" claims are very limited compared to the US. Thanks for the information /u/Brad_Wesley i gotta go now. It makes sense what you are saying, but no court in the US would see it that way. Good point. [deleted] They have no liability. The processing location could have been spoofed.  There is a slew of problems with your theory, but first he wasn’t acting on behalf of coke or within their policies. He also didn’t rob you. The three trannies did. Somewhere down the line he got your card info and committed a crime, but that’s not Coke’s fault or problem.  Thanks. What about employer liability? E.g: When I run a restaurant and one of my employees is poisoning a customers drink. Isn't the restaurant liable? He was using the card inside their facility. Hence used their infrastructure. Transaction time was 10:20 Pacific time so he might been clocked in too. This makes no sense whatsoever. What income did you miss out on here? You were going to miss working while on vacation.  No. You can’t sue coke for this as coke didn’t do it to you.  I am self employed. So I not only need the funds for the holidays but also to pay my salary and running cost back home. Edit: Maybe lost income is not the correct term but it's for sure a different calculation than when you're employed. English is my third language, sorry. You were on vacation. How did you lose income?
