 I have one rental unit with the tenant being unable to pay their rent. I believe they are planning to skip without notice. The tenant owes back rent and a separate amount of money for electricity. While I know I should consider myself fortunate that they are leaving however I want to know if I can collect those monies owed and if I should simply proceed in small claims court with rent owed + electricity bill owed. I do plan on doing a formal eviction as well. That was it - I just wanted to know if I have the ability to go after the money owed after the tenant was formally evicted.  Yes. You can sue a tenant for unpaid rent. Is there some part of the the question I'm misunderstanding? If electricity is the tenant's responsibility under the lease and as the landlord you were forced to pay that in some way, that amount may be recoverable as well. You should talk to your lawyer about the best path forward. Eviction is generally about possession of the property (and gaining a judgment for outstanding amounts due under the lease in that process). If the tenant surrenders the property you may have a simpler path to your remedy.
