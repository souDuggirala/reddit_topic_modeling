 My first post: [\_ripped\_off\_by\_coworker/]() I have found out that this person has scammed two other people at my workplace for a total amount of approximately $20,000. He used the same iPhone scam with all three of us and got us all to take out phones on credit for him to input into the "Apple Developer" program. We all thought it was just a legitimate program due to him working for Apple. Can we somehow sue him together for being scammed the same way? Or do we all have to go to small claims separately? Thatâ€™s possible too The three of us fear that the program was not real to begin with. We think that telling his company would only get him fired while none of us got our phones or money back. Thank you for the response. IANAL but if he took these actions on behalf of a company, you could try emailing the company and saying, Joe has me buy 5 phones for your program. I would like them returned to me.  Thank you for posting an update! All update posts are automatically locked due to a historical lack of on-topic discussion.
