 ðŸ”˜ 1 month ago, I was promoted to a salary position with a pay raise. As of today, I was told that I will be changed back to hourly but with the same pay rate. Do they need to give me an official written notice or is telling me in person legally fine? ðŸ”˜ there have also been 4 occasions practically in a row now that hourly employees havenâ€™t been paid on time, have received either more or less pay than their hours show and when the company pays them back days after the fact, it seems they do not factor in the typical taxes that would normally be taken from our paychecks. ðŸ”˜ Our HR person is very new to the company and seems very inexperienced in the role, so far they have already swapped hr/payroll companies and given people about a weeks notice. This also came with abrupt benefit changes for everyone throughout. They have also threatened to not pay people in an attempt to generate more concern about using the time clock properly regarding punch in and punch outs, itâ€™s a system connected to an Ethernet cable and occasionally the internet goes out affecting proper use and/or sometimes people just forget. Im considering contacting the Labor Board as I no longer feel safe with our current HR and leadership situation. Thanks for the advice Reddit!
