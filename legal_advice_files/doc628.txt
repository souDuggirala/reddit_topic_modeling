 Hello I am from Texas and as a minor can I conduct a first amendment at a post office and what are my rights and are they any different since Iâ€™m a minor? Exactly what do you think you want to do? And the quick answer is: just because you have the right to do something doesn't mean there are no consequences A "First Amendment audit" is not a thing. What are you considering doing? I hope you grow out of this phase soon or your life will be unpleasant.
