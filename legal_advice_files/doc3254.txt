 Long story short, there is a very popular bakery next to a Burger King, I’m parked in the BK parking lot right now. Is this illegal? I’m in The US.  It's not illegal but your car might get towed. BK parking lot is private property and you can generally park there with permission -- which is usually implied permission when you are a customer of BK. If you're parking in BK's lot and not patronizing BK, then you're at risk of getting towed. Different states and cities across the USA have different laws concerning the signage that must be posted alerting you to this. Your car could be towed. The BK parking lot is not overflow for the bakery unless there is an agreement in place between them.
