 I bought a house a year ago, the property disclosure stated there wasn't any water intrusion in the basement or anywhere else . A month later there was water coming through the block in the basement. I had this issue fixed through a waterproofing company for 5800 with an interior french drain. I was talking to the previous owner about a second parcel next door she was trying to sell herself and she admitted through text message that she knew of water in the basement before she sold the house. Can I take her to small claims to regain part of the lost money ? What do you think the odds are of me getting any money back ? Any advice on how to prepare for small claims would also be appreciated if you suggest going.
