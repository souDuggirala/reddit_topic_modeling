 Seems my buddy and I aren't getting the distillate cartridges we were expecting. On Thanksgiving I was killing time on my phone and decided to order distillate cartridges from an unknown source. I was given a tracking number and some bogus UPS website after paying a guy with the Cash App for some distillate cartridges from California. At this point is there anything worth doing? Weed is legal here, should I call the authorities? Or are we just outta luck? Thank you,  You were scammed. You're never getting your money back. What exactly do you expect to get by telling the police you didn't get your illegal drugs?
