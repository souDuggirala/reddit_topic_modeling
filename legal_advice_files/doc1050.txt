 There's a large redwood tree near the edge of my lot that's probably 25+ years old. It's close to my neighbor's driveway and probably about 15-20 feet from the closest edge of his house. He just sent me a letter saying that the roots of the tree are starting to damage his cobblestone driveway (that he put in a few years ago). He's also saying there may be roots near the edge of his foundation, and that if the roots damage either his driveway or his house that he will try to hold me financially responsible. Is this something I should be worried about? Could be a legit claim in the future. Roots are nasty  Technically he can start hacking away at ther oots that encroaching on his property and Sue you for damages. Don't ignore this. Roots fuck shit up.  A bit old, but I doubt this has changed much and this is specific to your situation http://articles.latimes.com/2000/sep/24/realestate/re-25961 If he is not asking for money now, I would try to come to a solution with him. Don't ignore it
