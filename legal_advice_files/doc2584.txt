 I am a benefited, full-time salaried employee for a state-run institution. There was a time 2 years ago I dropped from 1.0 (full time) to 0.75 while I was in my masters program. On 1/1/17 I was told I was returned to 1.0 again. (This is documented in a long chain of emails) During the month of Jan 2017, I also got married which changed my withholding and my insurance cost. My biweekly paycheck still increased, so I didn’t think anything of it. Additionally, there is nowhere for me to see the percentage of time I’m at (it’s not on paystubs or year end statements or anything). And my annual compensation statement says the correct salary number, I was just unknowingly making 85% of it. To further complicate things, in January 2018 I had a child and took FMLA. This left me with no PTO, so I took a lot of unpaid leave. Further reason why I didn’t catch my salary being off. My direct supervisor is dragging his feet and suddenly telling everyone he had no idea I was a full time employee. (I have email documentation to say otherwise) The HR of this state entity that is in charge of this has promised I will be made whole, but it’s been 5 days and I’ve seen nothing official even addressing my problem. On a related but separate note: I was removed from my job duties and former office while I was on maternity leave. They also hired a replacement within the calendar year of my leave. I haven’t officially complained about that but given the new developments (like working for fucking free), I’m ready to file a lawsuit for discrimination, and a wage dispute. Does anyone have any thoughts or insight?
