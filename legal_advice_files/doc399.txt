 Last night I was up all night vomiting with diarrhea, and decided that since I work in a pharmacy where I handle people's medications, that it would be a good idea to call out in case I was contagious. A little backstory, last night I accidentally dropped and broke a case of beer (4 six packs, about $32 worth of product.) After staying past my scheduled time to clean up my mistake, I went home, and planned on going in early the next (this) morning to mop a couple more times and sweep to make sure that there was no sticky floor or broken glass left. That plan changed with my sickness this morning. I called out, and my manager was clearly frustrated, but I justified it to myself that I had never before called out in the (almost) two years I've been there. He texted me tonight that I was "given the day off" on Monday because I wasn't able to cover my shift tonight, and left some broken glass on the floor (I thought I had got it all, but that's why I was going to come in early to verify the job was finished). I have very limited hours, being a student. Needing to take a sick day today, and not being able to work Monday is really going to hit my budget hard, since I barely make over minimum wage, even as a licensed pharmacy tech. Can they do this? Take away hours as punishment for me calling out one day out of two years of never doing so? Thanks. That's what I was afraid of. Unless you have an employment contract guaranteeing a set number of hours, of course your boss can cut your hours. You can also be fired for missing work. It doesn't matter if you are sick.
