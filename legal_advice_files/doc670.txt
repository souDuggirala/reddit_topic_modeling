 So my girlfriend \[33\] and her ex-husband \[33\] have been on bad terms for years. She has 65% custody of their daughter \[6\] and he has 35% custody. In November, he joined the military. He was remarried a year and a half ago to the woman he was having an affair with. He doesn't seem like a bad guy, but his wife is very manipulative. It's to the point where her daughter gets anxiety when she has to go to their house when her father isn't there. Now that he is getting deployed, he has filled out a DOPA (Delegation of Parental Authority) giving his rights to his wife. I've been trying to help my girlfriend find out information on when a DOPA is legally binding. Her lawyer is telling her that she should comply and give the 35% of her ex-husband's joint custody to her daughter's step-mother because she does not have the right of first refusal. She says others have told her that a DOPA is not valid if both parents have joint custody and one other parent doesn't sign off on it. I guess I'm just curious to see what her legal rights may be here in making sure that her daughter's step-mother of 18 months, doesn't get custody while the father is away. Is there anything she can do to get custody while he is away? Thank you. I appreciate the advice.  \ % of her ex-husband's joint custody to her daughter's step-mother because she does not have the right of first refusal. That's your answer. Don't do anything to exacerbate the situation.
