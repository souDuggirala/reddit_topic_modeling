 I got arrested about 3 years ago, and had probation for 2 years. Done with probation a year ago, now I’m fulling out my expungement paper work, and the lady at the courthouse mentioned something about expoungment court. Will I be drug tested or is there any reason for them to drug test me? There is always a chance a judge will ask for a drug test. I’m not saying it’s likely, but they can and they do when they suspect something.  Exactly that’s what I’m asking, will there be any chance? Never was when I was on probation. It’s always a bad idea to do drugs before appearing in court.
