 In Pennsylvania, how long does a company have to file suit against nonpayment on a credit account? Generally how long do they take to file that suit? Thanks.  Been going through a very tough time, but it seems the calls have stopped and I’m not sure why. It’s been about 4 months now since last payment.  [removed] Again, we cannot predict the future, and such questions are off-topic here. I apologize but I had follow up questions. Got removed for some reason. Do they usually sell the debt off first or stick with it? They have between two and four years to file the suit. As you've previously been told, we can't guess as to how long they may take.
