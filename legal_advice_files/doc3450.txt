 I will try to keep this as short as possible. At the end of august my SO started work at a residential home, for two months she worked there and received minimal training. At the end of October she was asked to talk to her manager in her office in which she was told that she was being let go and was told to leave the property immediately. She was given no reason as to why she was being fired and even after writing a letter for an answer she was still left in the dark. This in its self to me sounds very unjust but since then she has applied for multiple jobs and been successful at the interview stage to only be shot down because when they tried to get a reference from her most recent employer and they straight up refused to give one and on one occasion claimed a reference was in the post only to never be received. My SO has been told to never to step foot on the premises of her old job and even had to be escorted off the premises the day she was fired so going directly back to them is no good. Any help you can give us would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks /r/legaladviceuk may be a more appropriate place to ask. In the UK here In the USA, ex-employees are almost never entitled to a reference, though this may vary from state to state.
