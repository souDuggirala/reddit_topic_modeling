 Okay, so basically the title tells it all. My boyfriend, who lives in a different state, sent me 2 packages for Valentine’s Day and for my birthday. He got the apartment number mixed up and sent it to my name but an apartment I don’t live at, but still in my complex. His package tracking says it was delivered. I haven’t been able to contact the apartment owner, and am not sure if anyone lives in the apartment because it looks abandoned. My question is, if I can’t end up contacting the apartment owner, is there any way my boyfriend can get a refund or my package resent to the correct address, or is it a lost cause until I can speak with the people at the address the package was sent? Sorry for formatting, I suck at writing and am also on mobile.  Your only legal recourse is against whoever has the package. You need to identify them, ask them to give it back, and if they refuse, you could sue them for the value of the items shipped.
