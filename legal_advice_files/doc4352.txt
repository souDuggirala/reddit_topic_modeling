 I made a post about two weeks ago concerning a lawsuit that was brought against me and where to find an answer form. But, I have a question about the possible answers. From what I've read, there are essentially 3 answers: a "general denial" which denies the claim/allegations in said lawsuit, I can choose to "hear all proceedings on this case", or I can choose not to answer in which case a "default judgement" would be made. If a default judgement is made, more than likely a lien would be placed on my bank account and my paychecks will be garnished. So, I don't want to a general denial and I certainly don't want my paychecks garnished. By choosing to hear all court proceedings, what exactly is that saying? I live in Dallas, Texas. Ok. Thanks for your time.  “Hearing all proceedings” isn’t a thing. I don’t know where you got that, but it’s not a thing. You either file an answer, or you don’t. Those are the only options you have. In your answer, you can deny everything that the plaintiff claimed, or you can go sentence by sentence and either admit or deny them. Generally a petition will have numbered paragraphs to make this easier, but if it’s a pro se lawsuit it might not. So if the plaintiff’s petition says X, Y, and Z, you do have the ability to write in your answer that you admit X, admit Y, but deny Z. Also, remember to keep track of time. You have to file your answer by the first Monday after the expiration of 20 days from the date you were served. Your service paperwork should mirror this as well. File something before that date, because waiting can prejudice your case.
