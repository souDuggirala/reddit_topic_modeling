My landlord decided to renovate the hallways outside of all the apartments (really just lowered the ceilings, new paint job, and carpet) 
Anyways,  with the bad weather recently my bike has been tracking in grime/dirt 
Given that theres not really anywhere or place (although there is paid bike storage in the building) to clean off the bike before entering my apartment 
He may have offhandedly mentioned that he may have to get an external cleaning service to clean it when the weather gets worse - I dont want to be the asshole neighbor who tracks dirt over the place (when it was tile flooring I wiped up on particularly rough days but I like being able to commute) however I just want to be sure that he isn't able to bill me for the services 

 Sounds like youâ€™ll be paying for bike storage from now on.  He can absolutely bill you for the cleaning of carpets you have soiled.

You could also buy a garden pump sprayer and some rags to wash your bike before bringing it into your apartment. If there's a trail of dort from the door to your place, seems like he would have all the evidence he needs to make you pay the bill. At least for that part of the carpet. However, I know NYC has weird laws.  [removed]
