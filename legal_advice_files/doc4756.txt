 Hello r/legaladvice, I opened a thrift shop a couple weeks ago. I obtained a sellers permit and a Business Tax Certificate. A lady down the block does a weekly yard sale (mostly on the weekend). She sells 2nd hand items like me. She does not have sellers permit or Business Tax Certificates. What I can do? Thank you soo much.  Yes, I am in process of! Thank you for your input! Find out who the owners are and notify them. Yes it was! ☺️ No problem! Hope it's helpful!  Thank you for responding to my question! :) Thank you responding to my question.  I'd pursue that end of it then. I don't know about any precedent of pressing charges on someone for running a yard sale, even a recurring one; but, if it's property she isn't supposed to be using, then that could definitely be pursued legally, especially if it's yours.  Some states like in NY don't require you to have a street vendor permit if you sell books, newspapers, and other misc items. But they do if you sell jewelry and other stuff. Not sure about clothes. At least that's how it is in NYc.  No she does not. The place has been out of business for about year.  Is it on property she has permission to use?
