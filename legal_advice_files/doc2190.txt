 I went to pick up a car battery at my local Costco, when i went to pick up the battery, water from inside the battery spilled out and got on my clothes. the battery was damaged but sitting on the shelf. I realized later its not water but sulfuric acid, by then it already ate through my clothes. how should i make a claim and should i expect full amount for the damages? thanks it was earlier today. I called a lawyer to ask some questions still waiting for reply There was someone there this time of night? It was that at the time earlier? Sure, if you want to take it to corporate. Usually theyâ€™ll handle at the store level. You may need to get with the general manager though.  should i contact corporate? leaving damaged car battery on the shelf seems like a hazard. The store gave me an offer and it was really low, like 1/4 the total cost. Call the store manager and let them know what happened.
