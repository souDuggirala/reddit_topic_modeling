 I got transferred out of state for a new job. But I still got about 7 months of an existing lease left. Am I on the hook to pay for the rest of my lease in full or can I just say fuck it and abandon it? It seems sketchy I have to pay for something I'm not even using and I don't want to for 2 full leases to it's full maturity. I don't have my old lease on hand anymore so I can't even refer to any of it. Before you give notice as mentioned above, nicely ask the landlord for a copy of the signed lease. Same something simple but truthful like "I misplaced it and need a copy for my records." You really want to have a copy if things go bad and they file a judgment on you. I also recommend you give notice in writing. You want that for your own protection to prove you told them in case the apartment is damaged during the remaining 7 months of your contract. You should always keep a copy of your lease for reference. Take a picture and save to gmail. You can give your landlord notice that you are moving out, and they will need to mitigate their damages by following their normal procedure to re-rent a vacant unit once you're gone, but yes, you will be on the hook for rent until someone else takes over.
