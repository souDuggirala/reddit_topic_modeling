My STBX has filed for divorce, married 14 years, one child (13).  I was in a car accident 2 years ago, lost my job after the accident, and cannot do the type of work I used to do.  SSDI application has been submitted, waiting on that process.  Legal and physical custody will be 50/50 for each.

We're in mediation for the divorce and my earning capacity, spousal and child support figures are what we're currently discussing.  I used to make $135,000 a year in the tech industry.  I have both physical and mental limitations which are preventing me from returning to my old type of work.  My current income is $5,000 a year from dividends and interest. My STBX makes $85,000 a year.  If SSDI is approved it will be around $30,000/year.

The mediator has suggested $40,000 as my earning capacity based on a fictitious job description he created, well it's more mythical as no actual job like the one he's using as the basis can be found.   $18,000 is a more realistic earning capacity based on what I can do now (derived from a job posting I saw recently).  I will most likely have to go through training (at least 2 years) in order to do something else which earns more than the $18k and allows me to do that job given my multiple limitations and recovery activities and sessions. 

When making spousal support calculations, and child support calculations, is earning capacity used or actual earnings?  I know child support is calculated by the state and that spousal support is not and is a more negotiated item.  If earning capacity is used, how is that determined?

thanks
