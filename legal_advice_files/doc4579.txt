 First of all, this happened at a Public High School, in Europe. So, some days ago a student started an argument with a teacher because of a bad grade in the school hall. Long story short, teacher gets mad and starts yelling at the student, calling him the most stupid and idiot "thing" he has seen. Friend of mine records the whole thing, teacher notices and threatens him to delete the video otherwise he will take legal action. Well he does, and my friend's family lawyer actually tells them that the kid could even face jail time, even though he deleted the video. Is this actually possible? Is this actually illegal? Is my friend at fault? I am confused, so is him and his family and it would be good to hear your opinion. Thanks! That sounds like very US centric advice. Not sure about Greek law, but I know that in parts of Europe it's actually illegal to film in schools for various reasons, one of them being that for every minor present you need their parents' permission to film them and doing so without the permission is illegal. That's typical US law stuff that is worth 0 outside of your borders. Most countries protect privacy even in public spaces and especially at schools or working environments. The OP should trust their lawyer or ask a second opinioni from a different one if they, for some reason, don't trust their judgement. I don’t think you’re going to find anyone here who’s familiar with Greek law. If your friend doesn’t believe his lawyer he can seek a second opinion. This took place in Greece. Do you actually know anything about Greek law?
