 Roommates name was taken off the lease, name is still on the utilities but they aren’t the one actually paying, trying to rent out rooms but they won’t move their stuff, can I sell their stuff to rent out the rooms. Also, they don’t get their mail there. If they have abandoned their stuff there, then generally the proper course of action is to send the owner of the stuff, via certified/return receipt USPS mail, an itemized list of the property they abandoned, informing them that they have until X date (generally 30 days out) to make arrangements to retrieve their stuff, otherwise you will dispose of it accordingly. Keep a copy of this letter for yourself as well as the receipts and delivery confirmation you receive/will receive from the USPS. Then, within 30 days, they'll either come pick up the stuff, or you can dispose of it, and the problem is solved in one month or less. You can't just up and sell their stuff without their knowledge -- you generally must notify them and give them a reasonable amount of time to make arrangements to collect their belongings.
