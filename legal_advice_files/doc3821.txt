 Long story short, someone hit me. I’m getting an estimate today but I haven’t reported this to my insurance. Is it illegal NOT to report this? I’m hoping to not file a claim and just have the other driver pay it off if he doesn’t want his insurance involved. I’m really unsure what to do, this is the first time someone hit me. Check your agreement with your insurance. Mine states that I agree to report all accidents to them. It might be a breach of the contract you signed with your insurance to not report it.  Thanks for the advice Thanks, this was helpful There's a lot of possibilities to this. First off, it's not illegal to go through things between the two of you without getting insurance involved. However, if you get money from the person that hit you that pays for your repairs, don't be surprised if you get asked to sign something saying, "X gave me money for the accident, which satisfies my expenses." That way, you can't take the money AND make a claim on his insurance. If the other driver balks at paying, then you will need to go through their insurance, since they're the ones who hit you. If they refuse to go through their insurance, then you have two options. You can go through your insurance (if you have full coverage), pay the deductible, and hope you get reimbursed when your insurance goes after their insurance for subrogation. Option two is you sue him for the damages.  Is it minor/major accidents? If it’s minor little dents and scratches, it’s up to the party. Keep a copy and record, go through YOUR OWN garage for estimate, don’t let them use theirs. If the other party have issue, just tell them that you’d end this and will report it to insurance.
