 There is this local politician Joe Morrissey he has a wikipediapage. =sfla1 Hes a crazy person and reading about his life made me think hed have a very entertaining biopic. So I started writing a youtube web series about his life and career. I am a guy making this out of my garage shooting it with an iPhone. I have no money to hire a lawyer. In my script I take a bit of artistic license with Joe Morrissey's life. Can he sue me over that or not? It occurs to me that if I make this movie and only include things that factually happen he could still sue me. Is there any kind of law or legal precedent that protects people making farcical-ish biographies from litigation? What kinds of red lines cant I cross? Artistic license, aka you are going to make up crap. Yes, he could sue you for defamation.
