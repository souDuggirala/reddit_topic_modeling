 Just wondering if I can be a good neighbor some post on there the other day made it seem like I could be liable for snowblowing my neighbors sidewalk but that was a separate state.  The potential liability for engaging in snow removal in the thread lately is overblown. It is for the most part unlikely that you would face liability for having taken reasonable steps to remove snow from your driveway, walk, or sidewalk. Removing snow on your neighbor's sidewalk I guess could have some minimally increased risk but still no reasonable risk absent some extraordinary circumstance. Just ask them if its okay for you to plow their sidewalk from time to time, shoot em a text. You really dont need to do this, but if youre nervous enough to ask on here this should calm you down. Any potential for damages from then on would land on the property owners homeowners insurance.
