 So, I have a pretty basic question. I moved into a new apartment at the beginning of August and found that the AC unit was broken. I went up to the office and told them it was broken, so they told me to submit a work order and I did. About two weeks later no one showed up so I went back up there and told them I've been baking in my apartment for two weeks and I need someone to fix the unit. They told me they've been having a lot of AC units go out and they're workers are backed up and apologized. A couple days later a man came out and examined my AC unit and said they would be coming back asap to replace it. I was so excited. Well it's been about two weeks since then and no one has shown up, so I talk to them again and the said they decision to replace the unit was up to the owner so the lady said she would call and find out what the hold up was and call me back. I haven't heard back from them. Just a little background I go to school in the South where in August the temperature averages in the 90s. It's just a basic through the wall ac unit so it shouldn't be very expensive to replace. What can I do besides threaten to move? Are they required to replace it in a timely manner? Can I legally get them to dock the rent?
