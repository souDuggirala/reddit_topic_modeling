 This hasn't happened but I was wondering what are (if there are any) repercussions for your anti vaxx lifestyle causing others health issues in the UK So would you be able to sue someone that had the vaccination, but got sick and spread it? Like if they don't self quarantine? If you could sue an unvacinated person?  So would you be able to sue someone that had the vaccination, but got sick and spread it? Like if they don't self quarantine?  Most vaccines just significantly reduce the likelihood that you'll contract a disease, they don't actually guarantee immunity. Most childhood vaccines are only around 85% to 98% effective depending on the vaccine. Also, some vaccines gradually lose efficacy over time, so people who were vaccinated as a child may still be at moderate risk of contracting those diseases as an adult if they haven't gotten their booster shots. Copy and pasted off Google "Yes, people who have been vaccinated can get the measles, but there is only a small chance of this happening. About 3 percent ofpeople who receive two doses of themeasles vaccine will get measles if they come in contact with someone who has the virus, according to the CDC."  If you're vaccinated and so are your kids, why would you be at risk of getting something from an unvaccinated kid?  See my answer directly above.  NAL, I wonder how hard it would be to prove.  Couldn't it be some form of endangerment if you sent a antivaxx child who was ill with a vaccine prevented disease into a school/public area and it caused health issues? There doesnâ€™t appear to be precedent for this that says refusing to vax your kid is negligent or anything else along those lines. That may change soon though.
