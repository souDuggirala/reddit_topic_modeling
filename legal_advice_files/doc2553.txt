 My property is 61 ft by 140 ft at its widest and deepest. It is kind of a reverse "L" shape. 60+ feet are only about 35 feet wide, but I have been told that we are assessed and taxed on the measurements for the deepest and widest portion of the property. Meaning instead of just texting us for total square foot of property, it is taxed at it's largest dimensions. My neighbor then also is paying tax on the same piece of property....Am I right to want to fight the town on this. You don't say your location, but the answer is almost certainly yes. You are wrong. I have heard of no jurisdiction that bases property tax on land size. It's based off the value of the land. You are almost certainly being given wrong information by somebody.
