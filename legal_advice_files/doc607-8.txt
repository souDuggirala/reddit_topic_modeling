 Hi all. Hope this is the right place, I just don't know where to go for advice/info until I get to the MVA. I posted in r/Maryland so we'll see if that gets any feedback.

\*\*(I live in Maryland\*\*) So on December 30th, 2017, I traded in my old vehicle for a newer one. Have proof of new insurance still sitting in my email.

Today, 11 months later exactly, my dad called me saying he received a letter from the DMV regarding a $600 fine for "a lapse in insurance" on the vehicle I traded in. He cosigned on that vehicle, since it was my first one at 18 with no credit, so the letter was sent to his address. Now, I had to turn the tags in myself, not the dealership. I was a little delayed in doing so, about a month, but I got it done. (I will need to go visit my local MVA to see if they can pull up the exact date/any proof of this turn in, because I unfortunately don't have a receipt. I dropped them/my registration into their tag drop box at the branch. This is where I'm scared and feel this will screw me...)

I have proof of my new insurance and when I started it, and since it's Friday and I don't get out of work until they close, I will be going to the MVA on Monday to try and see if they can pull up proof of turning in my tags. Is there anything else I can do to dispute this? Do I need anything else?? Maryland is a pain in the ass when it comes to tags/registration and penalties, and I really would rather not have to pay a $600 fine for an insurance lapse on tags I stopped using almost a year ago and turned in. They sent one letter warning me about late fees *before* I returned them, but after returning them, I didn't receive a single letter from them about this until today.....
