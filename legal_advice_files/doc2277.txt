 sorry in advance for formatting I'm on mobile I just moved to Texarkana Texas a few days ago and thought it would be a great idea to get a job. I look on facebook and see, let's call it "company A" is having open interviews. I go in dressed semi nice I guess, and sit down when the chair is available. i go through the interview normally and he says he really wants to move me forward through the hiring process. at the end he asks which location id prefer to work at, bc they had 3 locations that all needed workers. I replied "location 2" he says that's awesome that's the place I manage! I leave the interview thinking it went great and that I probably got the job, a few hours go by and I get a text from a random number "you are very cute" naturally I think it's a spam bot number but reply anyway with "who is this" several messages pass and I figure out it's some gay guy that knows me, asking if I'm gay as well??? I say no but keep asking who it is and how he got my number. he says he got it from a friend but I just moved here and literally don't know anyone. he asks for my Snapchat and procedes to send me a picture of his face and I'm like holy shit it's the guy who interviewed me. I'm thinking either this is all a joke because I got hired and he's messing with me, or he took the phone number off the paperwork and used it to hit on me. I find his Facebook (looked back for the original ad) and found that he was married in 2014 to another male. he lies about being married and asks if he should stop messaging me. what should I do?? I can post screenshots later if needed. also I'm 18 tldr: guy who interviewed me for a job used my number to hit on me You should tell him to stop messaging you. Nothing illegal about being creepy.  You should report this to the company and find a job working under someone who isn't a creeper.
