 I know someone who recently held a fundraiser at a local mall for someone with cancer. The event was marketed on the mall calendar online with the words “All proceeds benefit [cancer patients name]” in large print on the page. She is pocketing a healthy portion of the money for herself and doesn’t see a moral problem with it. I wonder if it’s a legal issue? There is a lot of information I’ve found on large organizations doing this and getting in trouble for misrepresentation. She is just an individual (with helpers) and not affliated with any organization. She has done this several times already and I would like to let her know what you say. Thank you, and do the expenses matter? A new purse is not an acceptable expense for a fund raiser correct? Proceeds are the money brought in from a transaction or event. ... Proceeds can mean either the gross money earned (all that was brought in) or the net (the money left after expenses). So... in addition to potentially committing criminal fraud, I would bet dollars to doughnuts that the individual is not reporting the proceeds as income on their federal taxes. Thus, I would report it to either the [Texas AG Charitable Trust Division]() (though they may not have jurisdiction, but can hopefully point you to someone who does), or the federal IRS, and/or local and federal law enforcement depending on how much money is involved.
