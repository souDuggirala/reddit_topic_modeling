 I was driving a friends car (she was in the back, she had insurance) without a licence and crashed. My girlfriend at the time was in the passenger seat (no drugs or alcohol involved) And was seriously injured. A lawsuit against me and the owner of the vehicle came about, Now 10 years later a default judgment was made against me for a little over a million dollars. The document says it was my ex gf vs me and the owner, but I know she was already paid out by the insurance company (not the mvaf) m So my question is. Is this dischargeable in bankruptcy? And will they be able to continue to restrict me from having a drivers licence until I begin paying off this million dollars? I’ve heard some positive things but until I can get to the courthouse to retrieve a copy of the judgment in a town I can’t drive to I have to wait to meet with bankruptcy trustee. Thanks in advance! Your friend's insurance company would have defended you as well as paid out on your behalf, assuming your friend was allowed to let you drive. Most but not all debts can be discharged. There are some civil lawsuit judgements that cannot be discharged. A bankruptcy trustee can offer you more info. But why did you let this get to the point where a default judgment was issued? And if the default judgment was issued recently, you may still be able to have it set aside and go to trial.  It appears that in Canada, civil judgments can be discharged. I can't say what effect that would have on your license.
