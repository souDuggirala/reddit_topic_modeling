 I am a current college student living it was essentially a trash can of a house. Our property manager is notorious for being abusive but we were desperate and had to go with them. Our house does not have heating which has gotten unbearable to the point we've had to invest hundreds of dollars in space heaters and electric blankets. We called our landlord about this 2 weeks ago and they sent a guy out who basically said the heater has probably never worked and then he left. On top of this the windows do not work in any of the bedrooms (they are extremely difficult to open and do not stay open) which is a fire hazard. Basically, we have found a new place to live and just want a clean cut with the landlord. We understand this won't be easy but do not wish to deal with our current landlord anymore. Is there a process we are supposed to go about when dealing with this? We have not yet told our landlord we intend to vacate and sign a new lease. Do we just stop paying and go to court? Or do we have to go to court to invalidate the lease? At this point you likely need to make a written demand of your landlord that he repair the furnace. Give him a reasonable time to do so. If at that point he fails to make the repair you might be able to consider holding him in breach of the lease and moving out. If your university has any legal services you might involve them to ensure you have your ducks in a row before leaving.
