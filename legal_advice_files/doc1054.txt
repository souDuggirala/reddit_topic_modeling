 One of my roommates had a friend who punched and destroyed my 45" TV. I was not present and did not know the person was at our house. TV is a ~10 year old plasma, cheapest decent option of the same size is about $300 (TV was $900 new). In the state of WA, could I take him to small claims court and get the funds to buy a new TV? You cannot sue for replacement value. You can sue for the current value of the tv. Look online and see what the Same age and type of tv is selling for on eBay. I doubt it is much.  You'd get like $50 ... Not sure if it's worth it. You are only entitled to the value of a 10 year old outdated tech tv. I would recommend just talking to the guy and trying to get something outside of court since the value is so low  The most you'd get would be the value of a 10 year old 45" plasma TV.
