 Say I were to dropship a T-shirt with spongebob on it, not holding inventory. Would there be a consequence for selling things like this without the licensing? CT/USA [deleted] [deleted] Totally different.  [deleted]  Seems like you're not familiar with drop shopping. drop shipping isn't making or selling. it's reselling. An example of drop shipping would be if I charged $400 for a playstation 4, then you buy it from me and I go on amazon and order a playstation 4 to your house for the lower price on amazon and I keep the difference. It's a very common way that online stores operate and it's legal since the re-seller isn't producing the item. Unless of course, OP is drop shipping an unlicensed infringing item from someone who is infringing. [removed] Oh okay. Thank you You seem to think that physically holding an item bears on whether you are committing copyright infringement when you sell unlicensed merchandise. No, it has no bearing. It's the same analysis regardless of whether the merchandise physically passes through your hands.  ... so? You are still infringing on their copyright by making it and selling it. For a more obvious example you are basically asking if it's still murder if you stab someone to death rather then shoot them. I know why drop shipment means. Why do you think it matters? You're still the one selling it. It's still your product. Not holding inventory Of course. I don't see why you think drop shipping makes a difference where.
