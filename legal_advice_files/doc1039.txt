 My mother lives adjacent to a body of water used by the irrigation district. Her property extends into the water, though she can't use it for anything. The city has a land bridge that crosses this water and after decades of it falling into disrepair they have decided to expand the road to make it safer. This is great news as it's been slowly crumbling into the water and is a major passage for school buses. The offer they have made is pretty generous, as it is based off of the value of the whole property rather than just the land they would be buying. She fully intends to all the land. The question is, what costs will be involved in this? Surely it's going to require at least a survey. Please hire a real estate attorney. Don't rely on their attorneys to look out for your mother's best interests - they are looking out for the city's interests.  I am not. I would guess they would probably get a cut but they may be able to negotiate a better deal. 90% of a lot is better than 100% of not so much. There should be a written agreement with addresses this. I would retain a lawyer to make sure everything is written properly. She may be able to get them to cover her legal fees.  I'll look over the contract once it's written up with that in mind. Thank you I feel like this is going to involve giving them a cut. Are you a real estate agent? I would get a real estate agent involved. Just to make sure everything is on the up and up. They should be paying these costs. Make sure the contract says so. The bottom line is though that they can eminent domain it especially for a road and she's better off negotiating for a good payment than forcing them to go to court.
