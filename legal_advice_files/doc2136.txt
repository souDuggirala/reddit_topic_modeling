 A family member took care of an old man in his last few years and to our surprise left his native land to this family member. Xxx,xxx shares in the land payout 16k a year in 4 different instalments but the native board has informed her that they can buy her out for just 10k for not being native (beneficiary buyout). Is this correct or is she being taken advantage of. Yes. This land is on a reserve?
