 Okay so I ordered a monitor off Currys PC World. They delivered it via dpd but the box looks a mess, not too rough but it's clearly not been handled as carefully as you'd expect a fragile item to be. So I open It up and as expected its busted. Looks like someone's punched it straight in the centre, broken pixels, a big crack. I found this out a few minutes ago I'm just wondering what my options are. do I call them up and tell them it's faulty? How easy would it be for them to turn it on me and say I did it? Is it even possible for them to replace this damage and how did it possibly leave the shop like this? DPD are usually pretty good so I can only assume it happened at a warehouse. Yes of course you call the merchant that sold you the item and see how they want to handle it. Take photos of the damaged state it arrived in. Possibly contact the delivery people and definitely PC World.
