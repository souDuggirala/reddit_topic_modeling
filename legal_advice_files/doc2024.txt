 So my friends sister was taken to jail and apparently she used my friends name when she got booked. We don’t know if this is the first time she’s used her name but we found out she has felony charges. What should she do? Also, we found out because of an Instagram page that showcases criminal activity in our state, we’ve asked them to take it down but is there anything else we can do on that front as well? Thank you. Contact the prosecutor and court where she is charges so you friend doesn't end up with warrants when her sister doesn't show up to court. Talk to the police about having the sister charges with criminal impersonation. As far as Instagram, I would attempt to nicely ask the account owner to remove your friend's information. You may have to provide them with proof of the impersonation. If that doesn't work try contacting Instagram. 1. what should she do? 2. Is there anything we can do if the Instagram page is posting my friends info, even though she didn’t commit the crimes? What do you want done? You haven't really asked a question?
