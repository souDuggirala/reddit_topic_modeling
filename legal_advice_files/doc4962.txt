 I just moved to a new city in Utah 3 days ago. I rented a room in a 4 bedroom house. 2 girls have been there 1-2 years, and then one just moved in a month ago. They run a pretty tight ship as far as cleanliness and having guests over. I won’t bore you with all the details, but basically this one girl, let’s call her Marie, has basically been put “in charge” by the landlords (a husband and wife). We had a roommate meeting last night to discuss house rules and establish some guidelines and boundaries. Me and the newer girl had concerns about the rules of the house and just wanted to have an open discussion about it. Apparently Marie was not happy with the outcome, even though our landlord (the wife) was present and thought it went okay. Marie has been complaining to the husband, and because of this, they are terminating my lease and giving me 15 days to move out. It’s technically a month-month lease. I don’t know if this is legal or not. This whole situation is so screwed up because I’ve literally done nothing wrong but express my concerns. I clean up my messes, keep to myself, and am friendly to all roommates. It’s seems ABSURD to kick me out after 3 days of living here. Also, I live in a ski town where there is VERY scarce housing at this time of year. The wife said if I can work it out with Marie, it will be okay, but Marie is not one to compromise. HELP! 15 day notice is all they need to give you for month to month. Consider finding new accommodations or making some concessions in the living arrangement.
