I did all the lawyer stuff they needed providing things like bank statements to prove the money situation and everything and we did the filing with the court.

Turns out he did quit his job and before he left tried to make things worse by removing his card from the bills that he could and had the cellphone bill go-to a paper bill instead of paperless and tried a few others but when they wouldn't let him it now makes sense why he cancelled his credit card and mine. The bill still comes but since those were in his name I guess I don't need to worry about that just yet.

Now the bad news sadly, since they don't know where he is nothing really changes at all and now  I have to wait and see what happens. There is another date over a month away to start the divorce but apparently that's going to become an issue too since he needs to be found or we wait longer again from what I was told.

One final fun thing I'm pretty certain he did but they won't tell me is I had two CPS people showup and inform me of allegations that I cannot take care of my child/provide diapers or food etc. Once I explained it all to them, and showed them what I had from my lawyer they seemed to just let it be. I guess partners trying to use them as a way to harass the other isn't anything new to them, except they will still be checking in apparently to make sure.
