 Basically what the title says. My husband and I moved to another city in Florida back in May. My husband quit his old job and failed to give them a forwarding address. Now that it is tax season, we need his W2 from his old job. However, he used to work as a manager in student housing apartments and the complex has changed management hands (happens all the time). He’s tried calling the current and old corporate management company and no one ever answers. We’ve left multiple voicemails and emails and can’t get anyone to respond to us. What recourse do we have? How do we file our taxes if we can’t get his W2? Also, sorry if this doesn’t belong here. This was the first sub that came to mind.  Thank you so much! We’ll try that. And yeah, I already gave him hell for not providing a forwarding address. Safe to say it won’t happen again! :) He really should've kept them updated with his new address, but if they're not responding to him, he can get his wage transcript from the IRS (assuming they created W-2s and filed them with the IRS). PSA for everyone: Every December, make sure any jobs you worked (or other financial institutions that might need to send you a 1099) that calendar year have your current address.
