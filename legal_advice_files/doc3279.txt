 So I have a monthly membership to a big name car wash in my town. Unlimited washes for X amount a month. I went to get my car washed yesterday and as usual i pulled through the express side, it was a little busy so the gate told me to wait for the other car to merge in. My turn came and i pulled up as far as the car in front of me would allow. Next thing i know i hear a giant crash and see the gate lifting off my car, and employees eyes are just wide as I've ever seen. I got out to do a real quick check to see if i could see anything but it was so busy i had to get back in to not hold up the line. After i got out i could see plain as day the scratches on my back tailgate, and a gouge in my back window. The AGM tells me she can only approve the gouge on my window at the moment, and needs the GM approval for the rest of the scratches, even though she showed me the video of the gate closing. She was trying to say the gate didn't do the scratches. She told me she would email me the video as well, which i have not received. She then told me to take it to a big name auto shop in town, as they have an account there and they will fix me up. Do i have to take my car to the shop they are telling me? Can i have a 3rd party look at the damage and do it that way? What is my next step here? You can also let your insurance company fight it out with them. Thatâ€™s what you pay them for. You can discuss the alt shop but they dont have to agree. They offered their shop which is fair. If you want another shop, youre gonna have to prepare to bill them. If they dont agree, most likely will end up in small claims court
