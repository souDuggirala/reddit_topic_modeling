 HR just called to inform me they messed up by sending me another final paycheck and said the check has a stop payment on it already. However they're asking me to send it back to them with void written on it. It was an awful job and want to put it behind me so I'm inclined to tell them to fuck right off. I obviously won't cash the check because I was already paid and that would be theft but nothing should happen if I do nothing.. right? If you don't cash the check but don't send it to them you probably wont put yourself in any legal jeopardy, but they might keep bothering you. If you really don't want to send it back, take a video of yourself tearing it up in to tiny pieces, save it in two places, and send it to them if they keep bothering you.  Right. Don't cash it.
