  Ive been on Medicaid Food Stamps for more than 10 years. I was also on TANF for like 2 years about 7 or 8 years ago. With all this said my questions are below: Say Im a beneficiary on a life insurance policy or I win a cash settlement of and I get $25,000-$250,000 or more as pay. Can DCF Medicaid take that money to pay back services rendered? If I take out a life insurance policy for myself and name my daughter as beneficiary. Can DCF Medicaid take that money thats due to her? Can DCF Medicaid take any property that I may purchase even if I stop services? What if I stop receiving benefits then move to and live in a different state? Would that make a difference? Can I fight it?
