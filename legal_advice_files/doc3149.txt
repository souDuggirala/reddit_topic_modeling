 I live in an apartment complex in Louisiana, and heard rats inside of the wall. The maintenance man came out and put rat poison in the roof from the outside and from inside via the air filter. He assured us that if a rat died inside the walls, he would remove it. December 23, my roommate and I smelled a rat decaying in the wall. We decided to just wait until after the holiday to contact them, and called on the 26 of December. The maintenance man came out, put a hole in the wall and said that because of the insulation, he wasn't going to be able to find the rat and we should try some air fresheners. He left, didn't patch the hole and when I called the owner of the property, he basically told me that I was just going to have to wait for the smell to dissipate. I don't know what to do moving forward from here and I don't know what I'm entitled to. Thank you in advance for the help. TL;DR rat in an apartment wall, office won't do anything about it, what do I do? As someone who battles with mice on a yearly basis sometimes it just isn't realistic to get them out without tearing the walls completely apart. Sometimes the solution is to just wait for them to "dry out" as much as it sucks. Your landlord should still have them at least patch the wall back up though.
