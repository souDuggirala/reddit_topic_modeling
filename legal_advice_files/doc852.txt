 My mom is in her late 70s and lives in Naples, Florida. She came home to find her neighbor's landscaper completing work redoing the landscaping on her property between the two houses. She confronted her neighbor who, in her words, said he was "making her property look better". For reference, my mom employs her own landscaper to upkeep her property. Nothing there has ever been overgrown or unsightly in any way. My mom is trying to figure out what she can or should do. In a broad sense, I don't think she was particularly harmed. There's no part of the previous landscaping she was hugely attached to and the new landscaping isn't apparently offensive. But the balls on this neighbor to change her property without asking or apologizing has got her pretty angry. What might her options look like?  I hate to tell you, but good fences make good neighbors. You need to establish property lines, and that will require a surveyor and a trip to city hall, records department. You need to inspect if there are any easement laws, as well as local ordinances on lawn care. Make sure that he's not looking to expand his property - it starts with them maintaining a small extra piece, then wiping the boundary, to putting a fence on your side of the property line. Nal, but I'd say definitely serve the guy a tresspass notice, to include any "family, guests,and anyone employed by or related to "homeowner x" in any way", making it clear that no one, at any time, in any way, shape or form has the consent of "homeowner y" to step on their property or alter it in any way. The guy wants "legal" ...well...have a legal "stay the heck on your side of the property line" notice. I vote this  Take him to small claims. Make him pay for what it would cost to replace what she had. AND THEN JUST LEAVE IT THE SAME That’d be an ultimate “fuck you” She can demand the neighbor put things back how they were. The balls on some people.
