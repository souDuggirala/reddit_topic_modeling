 Makes sense. Yet the action doesn't.  That sounds like abusive behaviour to be honest, friends shouldn't break your stuff and then refuse to make amends for it. S'like this excerpt in Lundy Bancroft - funnily enough, they only break your stuff when they "just lose it", never their own. There's no loss of control, they know what they're doing. Winning is just the first part. You need to collect. That isn’t as easy as it sounds.  I think you need to get better friends They did it on purpose after a fight though  I’m NAL but it sounds like you need to take them to small claims court. Save all information related to the case, such as any expenses you paid to fix your phone or any texts related to this between you and your ex-friend. There might be a filing fee for small claims court. It might be worth it if you win though. Umm.. Its a 'Friend' right? Aren't friends supposed to pay you when they fuck up your stuff?
