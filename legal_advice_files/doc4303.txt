 I’m just going to get to the point, I met a girl at a bar and took her home. She told me not to use a condom and I was okay with that. Near the end of the encounter, she told me to pull out when I’m ready to cum, I did not. Obviously she was not happy about it. My friends are telling me that I raped her and that she could have me arrested if she’s angry enough. Do I have anything to be worried about? From what I’ve seen this isn’t illegal but I wanted to double check and get some legal advice if the police do show up.  It could be considered forcible sexual abuse under Utahs definition. To quote “Forcible sexual abuse: Touching another person's anus, buttocks, genitals, female breasts, or taking indecent liberties or causing another person to take indecent liberties with the defendant or another person, without consent, with the intent of causing substantial emotional or bodily pain or arousing or gratifying a person's sexual desires, and the victim is 14 years of age or older.” You took an indecent liberty to gratify a sexual desire.  The reason your friends are saying that is because you deliberately, knowingly violated this woman's consent. Ethically/morally your friends consider your behavior rape. But it's not what the law considers rape. Maybe you should stay away from women for awhile. Lucky for you that’s what Rape kits are for. They will check for signs of force and other factors that lean towards rape. You didn’t pull out, that’s not rape. She could definitely say she was and she would have proof of your semen, but there is a lot more hoops and hurdles she has to run thru. I would detail everything in writing in case you are worried and I would get tested as well. You didn’t wrap it up and there is a ton of diseases out there that would be my main concern.  Your friends are incorrect. It's not rape.
