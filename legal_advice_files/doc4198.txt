 I work in a non-unionized healthcare environment that is affiliated with our local regional health authority. Our department has been operating for 13 years and has always been slightly behind in keeping with the unionized collective agreement, but has always delivered backpay and honoured the regional health authority payscale. The government approved wage increases for our field of work in 2016 which for union members went into effect in 2017 (they received backpay). My workplace gave us part of the wage increase and part of the backpay but we did not match the approved payscale outlined in the collective agreement. Management promised that the rest of the pay increase and backpay were still coming. We continued to operate within union standards (i.e. our manager has told us to refer to our union's collective agreement in regards to breaks just two months ago, in writing). On Dec 3rd, management told us we would no longer be getting backpay and no longer matching the union's collective agreement payscale. \- My confusion mainly comes from us being non-unionized: Should we have been given notice of this change to our payscale agreement prior to it occurring? \- Our management is claiming the funding was never approved for us (though it was approved for all technologists in my field, not only unionized technologists) and trying to put this blame on our local regional health authority. If we were to pursue this in small claims court (which none of us know anything about), how do we know who is at fault? Our management or the health authority?
