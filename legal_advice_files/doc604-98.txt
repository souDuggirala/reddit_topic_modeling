My mother is going to collage and has a teacher who is violating her student rights and harassing her. He also harassed the rest of the class. He discriminated against women in specific   and he gives women wearing scant clothes and younger girls higher grades. She has tried contacting the dean to no avail. She is too afraid to take legal action and could use some help right now. You do not have enough information for anyone to comment appropriately.

However if you're absolutely sure this is happening, consult a lawyer that specializes in basic rights.  &gt; violating her student rights and harassing her

In what way? does she have any proof of these actions? (e.g emails)

&gt;  he gives women wearing scant clothes and younger girls higher grades

Any proof of this being the reason? 

&gt; has tried contacting the dean to no avail

What happened when she contacted the dean? What was the response? 

What is the school's grievance procedure, and did your mother follow this? 

In what location is this occurring?  Sorry your mother is having a tough time in school, but nothing you've said points to legal action being available for her, which I guess doesn't matter since you've indicated she's unwilling to take any. What else would she like done?

Your post is also sorely lacking in details. You say "she has tried contacting the dean to now avail." What does that mean? That she cannot establish contact, or that the dean does not want to pursue the issue?

Way more detail would be needed to understand the harassment and discrimination that you believe are happening, but my candid assessment from what you've posted so far is that there is more emotion than actionably unlawful action at play here. How exactly is he harassing her and violating her student rights?  And what happened when she contacted the dean? What proof do you have off this? How do you even know that grades are given for cleavage and not right answers?

And how is she being harassed? Specifically
