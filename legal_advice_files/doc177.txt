 So I went to Meijer today, had about 12 things in my cart. Went to self-checkout after running around the whole store inadvertently, which probably caught LP's attention firstly. I go to the check-out, bag 10 items, keep the other 2 in my cart, and start to walk off. Employee catches me while still in store, asks to see receipt. I show him, and he notices I didn't pay for a couple items. I act surprised, yet cool, and go pay for them. Manager comes over and makes sure I'm paying. I pay the two items, which totaled to $6.79. They don't take my name or ask for any information. Is this considered "shoplifting" if I hadn't even walked out the store? By me not providing any information, and the amount of the two items, would it be safe to assume I won't get any sort of letter asking for a summons or a fine? I did use my personal credit card, and frequently go into the store. You passed the last point of sale without paying for those two items. You don’t need to technically leave the store with the merchandise to be charged with theft. The fact that you mentioned that you “acted surprised and played it cool” makes it seem like you were trying to get away with it. I would believe that since they had you go back and pay, after I assume you made them think it was a “mistake” and they did not call the Police at the time makes me believe you won’t be facing any charges. This type of thing happens all the time with the self checkouts and people trying to sneak things by without paying for them. Now if you would have kept walking and refused to cooperate with staff, odds are the Police would be called. Pay for everything from now on. You didn't leave the store so you didn't actually shoplift
