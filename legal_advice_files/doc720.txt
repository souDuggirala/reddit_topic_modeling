 I recently came across a book (SÃ¼gisball/The Autumn Ball, Mati Unt) that was written in the USSR in 1979 and translated to English in 1985. I believe it was published by the Soviet/Russian publishing company Periodika. The book and author are Estonian, not Russian, but it was written during the Soviet era. The author died in 2005. I discovered that I couldn't find any online sellers on English websites that sold the book and no scans exist. I'm considering scanning the book myself and uploading it so that others can read it but I'm unsure of how copyright would work in this situation. Should I be looking at Russian copyright law? Soviet? Estonian? American? I really don't want to upload the scan if I'm violating any laws. If any of you can give me a good jumping-off point to research this sort of thing, I'd appreciate it. Thanks.
