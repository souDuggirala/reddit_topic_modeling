 Greetings, I was sued recently and now have a judgement against me. I have received a notice that I will be garnished and have to go to an asset hearing next month. What do I need to bring? I rent and have a car payment and nothing in the bank. I have no real assets. Do I just bring a copy of my lease, bank statement, and paycheck? They will give you a form to fill out with all your income sources, where your bank accounts are, and all assets you own. Basically it allows the creditor to know where to collect their money. The debt is mine from an outstanding credit card Are you filing bankruptcy are you sure the debt is yours
