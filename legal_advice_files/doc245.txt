 I'm a full-time salary employee in Oregon. The company I work at is a wholly owned subsidiary of a Canadian company. Im technically an employee of the Canadian company but everyone I work with is an employee of the US subsidiary. When I was hired I got 2 extra holidays than the subsidiary company. They are now talking about taking those 2 days away from me. Is that legal? If they did this, would they they have to like move me to be an employee of the subsidiary? Does anyone have ideas on how I can fight this, like maybe ask for additional PTO days, etc. I appreciate any advice! Yes... It's poor form but legal unless you have a contract. Your employer is not obligated to provide additional compensation or PTO... But might do so for optics and/or to retain you.
