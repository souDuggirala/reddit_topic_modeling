 Title pretty much sums it up. January of 2018, my GF(23) went to the dentist for some work and ended up getting a root canal. The dentist was unable to place a crown on the tooth and scheduled an appointment about 3-4 weeks later. Which got postponed for 2 months. And again. And again. And again. Every appointment, we were called the day before, in one instance about an hour before the appointment saying the doctor was out. So many days of missed work. Here we are a whole postponed year out. The temporary cap fell out and yesterday my girlfriends tooth shattered eating a corn nut. Is there anyway to hold the dentist liable? We were never given the option of having the work finished elsewhere. If the dentist didn’t postpone the tooth wouldn’t have broke. Not looking forward to additional medical bills.  They made it seem like it wasn’t a pressing matter. We actually have an appointment for another in a month. Trying to get in sooner.  They made it seem like it wasn’t a pressing matter.
