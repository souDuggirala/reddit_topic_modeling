 Last Friday I got a package in the mail from USPS and I opened it and I didn’t recognize it. I looked at it and it was supposed to go to my neighbor. I left it on my breakfast and was going to return it later because I was busy at that time. I forgot about it and Thursday rolls around and I come home and my wife tells me that the mailman said his substitute placed a package in my mailbox by accident. The mailman asked to put the package in the mailbox if we find it. I don’t have a good relationship with my neighbor and I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to get in trouble for opening his mail by accident or being sued for delaying mail or something like that. Any advice to protect myself legally? Will do, thanks you! Oh. Skip the cookies then and eat them yourself. And skip the note. Just put it in his mailbox and if the police are called just tell them what went on. They seriously won't care.  Can you just put it on his porch? The reason I said my neighbor doesn’t like me is because he’s contacted the city before to get police to take pictures of my yard and fine me $1,000 for something like not cutting my lawn and not cutting weeds  You're overthinking it. People open mail that comes to their address all the time. Opening something not intended for them before realising is a very common thing to happen. This is still just neighbour stuff. Just pop it in the mailbox with a note that says "sorry, meant to return it sooner but got busy" and add in some cookies or something else neighbourly. People like cookies. Don't mention it being opened, people open mail that's not theirs all the time, your neighbour probably gets it. Worst case scenario you're accused to trying to steal, cops (if called) do nothing because the item was returned (they may encourage you, if they attend at all, to not be so forgetful next time) and neighbour just doesn't like you for a bit.
