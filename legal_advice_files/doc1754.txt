 Hello, I've been creating a walk-able 3D environment (an architectural visualization project essentially) in my spare time which is based on a real public location (closest recreation I can do from memory). I never intended for it to become a full-time project (or something that I would release), but it's turning out really well. I've had the idea to turn it into the setting for a commercial video game. Here are my concerns. 1. My scene is heavily based on a real place (very similar floor plan and looks), and I don't have permission from the owners. 2. I'm thinking of developing this into a horror game, but no particularly disturbing themes. Think Amnesia: The Dark Descent if you're familiar with it. Basically I'm worried that (1) there would be copyright issues of the layout and look, and (2) defamation, because of content in the game that the owners might find inappropriate. If it's relevant, the building was built before 1990, which apparently is when architecture of new buildings could be copyrighted. My old high school. The school administration are very conservative and crazy. What kind of property is the location? You could ask them? I know that this is the intuitive response, and I appreciate your comment, but do you know of any law sources that can back this up? Change a few things to make it 'different'
