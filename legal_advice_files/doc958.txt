 So donâ€™t hate on me fur being a furry. What happened is while I was fursuiting a P.E.T.A. activist came and splashed me with red paint. This RUINED my $2400 fursuit. is there anything I could do?  I do not know who it was but I have a vid of me getting splashed at a fur meet and they are out of frame Were you in a fursuit at a PETA event while protesting? Or did they show up at a fursuit event to protest? Do you know who did it? Do you have any evidence it was them? You can sue the person who did this. You can also file a police report.
