 A friend of mine was returning from a afterparty at this bar(in San Francisco). Which i myself left an hour before him. When he and his cousin(female) decided to leave the bar to head home, the cousin’s friend( lets call her individual 1) and her friend (individual 2) decided to hop into a friend’s car who was giving them a ride. According to their account, the individual 2 was very intoxicated, belligerent and kept provoking my friend. Then she fell asleep for a few minutes. When she woke up shortly after that nap, she immediately started shouting nonsense and hitting my friend on the head. He got surprised by this crazy women’s behavior and couldn’t do anything but shield himself with his hands. Keep in mind this all transpired in the car while it was moving and that my friend is not very big (5’6”) and one of the friendliest people i know. So while successfully shielding himself for a short time, he got punched on face multiple times and possibly got his nose broken. She wasn’t harmed at all aside from being pushed back by my friend after getting punched on the face. He is not sure what to do since he is on a travel visa (in the US) and returning back home this January. Please advise on what to do for my friend. He can call the police and report what's happened.
