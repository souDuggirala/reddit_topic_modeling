 GM was hospitalized for a back infection, over the holiday she was given medicine by the head nurse on duty that she is known to have bad reactions to. She is worse off now, seeming to lose mental stability, cant follow convos, asking for people who arent there (none of which were issues before this) does this constitute malpractice? Is there anything legally we can do about this? Posting for another family member for any advice. Thanks. Thank you for the reply. Ill pass it along :) Nurses, unless they’re advanced practice nurses do not have prescriptive authority, so they’re limited by what a physician orders. While family may certainly weigh in on medications, ultimately, it’s the physician’s decision. If they feel medical malpractice is involved, they should certainly consult a lawyer.  Malpractice of any kind is very fact specific and it is unfortunately beyond the scope of this subreddit. If this is a medical question, it is highly recommended to speak with a medical malpractice attorney; your state's bar may be able to refer you to one. They typically work on contingency, meaning there is little up front cost to you. Similarly, consultations are typically free. It wouldn't hurt to meet with one, have them look over your info, and go from there. If this is a question about legal malpractice, you should seek the advice of a second unrelated attorney and/or report the matter to your state bar association" I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
