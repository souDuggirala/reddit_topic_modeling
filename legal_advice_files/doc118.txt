 In my college town there’s one particular bar that everyone goes to but the only problem is that the exit/entrance has a massive pothole that is a legitimate problem. I have friends who have gotten into accidents due to this hole and many Uber drivers refuse to even pick kids up from this location due to the risks of the hole. Is there anything me or really anyone can do since it’s on private property? Drive around, offer to fill it yourself, complain, go to a different bar.
