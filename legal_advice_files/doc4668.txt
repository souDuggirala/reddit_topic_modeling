 Hello, I will try to keep this short! I live in an apartment and the landlord contracts an exterminator to spray for bugs: when they spray, they’re only supposed to spray around baseboards. I have clear, thick substance spots and spray patterns on my cookware, bakeware, and appliances in a low cabinet. I got curious and started looking at the baseboards and it’s the same chemical spray pattern as the pyrethrin the exterminator uses and it has the same consistency. I tried cleaning the affected items but it won’t come away. I have stored the affected items in boxes in my closet and have taken several photos. Landlord is siding with the exterminator saying they don’t spray cabinets unless empty. Here’s the thing: I have used the cookware assuming it was hard water spots. I’ve had some minor health issues and palpitations. I only just discovered the sprayed appliances when I went to get them out for Thanksgiving. Here are my questions: I know the chemical name, do I contact poison control? I have renter’s insurance, is this something they would cover in terms of item replacement? Is burden of proof on me, or is it on the exterminator or landlord? What do I do? :( Please review the [Landlord Tenant Questions]() section of the /r/LegalAdvice Wiki for common questions and answers regarding landlord tenant issues.
