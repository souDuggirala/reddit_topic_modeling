 A few days ago i was almost defrauded of 28 euros and then of 20 euros as the fraudster lowered her demands. I was approached on a crowded street by a young woman who claimed she was pregnant and lived in a camper with her young child and her grandmother and she needed money to buy milk for her son. I at first believed her but when she would not give any documentation by which i could find her i grew suspicious and with the excuse i was going to change money to give her 20 euros i asked the owners of the bar in which i entered if i they knew the young woman by pointing at her. She must have noticed my gesture as she fled the street. Now this was a pretty obvious case of fraud but in cases of more elaborate fraud how can i defend myself? I am on the autism spectrum and i happen to be rather gullible. I am also finishing up my studies and i suspect while applying for a private sector job after\\if i get my masters' degree i could be subject to exploitation in the form of fake contracts. Dont give money to strangers. And if you have a problem with determining if giving money is a good idea, dont give money to anyone.
