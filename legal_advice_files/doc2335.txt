 Today a coworker confided in me he may not work much longer. His license will be revoked in a week, and with no way to get to work, he will be fired. In talking with him I discovered he had been contacted recently by social services (he did validate that it wasn't a scam). They allegedly told him he had missed several payments for child support. He didn't tell me how many. SS (Social Services) said that they would be revoking his license at a certain point, if he didn't pay the missing amount. My coworker was denied access to the trial for custody of his kid, and hasn't been allowed to see her at all. He has extensive documentation of all his interactions, along with a paper trail proving SS didn't contact him. He doesn't have enough money for a lawyer, let alone to pay what SS demands. What should he do? His legal problems aren't new, a judge would have signed off on the child support, and he would have had to provide financial documents to the court to prove his income. The custody is a separate issue that has nothing to do with the child support - it sounds like he is fishing for sympathy. If he is barred from attending the custody hearing, he would have had to make some serious threats, harassment or assaulted against someone. That doesn't just happen (I'm sure he has an excuse for this as well.) He can try and contact legal aid, or shop around for a lawyer who might take payments or drop their rate. There are also men's groups, or law students that could provide low cost or free support and information. If he is unable to drive, he can do what a lot of other people do - take advantage of public transportation, bicycles, Uber and/or taxis.  He needs to get current with his child support payments, and if unable to afford them, then go back to court to change his support amount.
