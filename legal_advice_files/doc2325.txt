 Just something that I thought of in the shower. There must be a federal order or law that protects Minor’s (and for that matte adult’s) SSN for digital storage. For example, it surely can’t be legal to have a notepad file just sitting on your desktop with your kid’s SSN in it. Thanks for any answers Social security numbers are on every mauled in tax form, every copy of a tax form, on ss cards mailed to you. No laws against this.   But to answer your question, there is no law that says "a minors SSN cannot be in an unencrypted file"   Schools are required to comply with FERPA which requires schools to protect students records from unauthorized disclosure.
