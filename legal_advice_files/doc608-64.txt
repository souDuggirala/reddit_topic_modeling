So this has been going on for 2 years now, now 16 yo. We do not know what else we can do to avoid bankruptcy. 

We have gone above and beyond for the last 2 years to help her. We have done everything we could think of and everything the state and doctors have recommended. She is not safe at home with herself, and potentially others if they get in her way.

She went to an assessment center for a month and they could not place her, nor can the state find anything for her so she is back in Juvenile detention since it's the only place to keep her safe. That costs us about $100 a day on top of the medical expenses. She has been inpatient at every place in the state that would attempt to take her, close to a dozen stays in the last 24 months. Now that the state has had custody for some time they are coming after us for child support even though we pay all her medical expenses that my employer health plan(that I pay for) and medicare doesn't cover, which is still significant. We didn't get Medicare approved for her until early this year.

We have entertained termination of parental rights but highly doubt any judge will grant it. 

Do we have any other courses of action that I can discuss with an attorney once we find one or are we doomed to wait this out for close to another 2 years and file for bankruptcy? We are struggling to even find a family attorney that can help in our county. We cannot stomach ignoring her completely for 6 month to show abandonment. But as we see it at the rate my wife and I are losing ground our daughter will not have a home or family to come home too if she ever gets through this, currently it has gone from bad to worse, she thrives on the sympathy and being the victim.

Thanks for any Advice Are you asking if you can relinquish legal responsibility to care for your 16 year old daughter?
