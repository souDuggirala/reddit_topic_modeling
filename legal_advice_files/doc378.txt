 Whole story: i have a grandma who passed away....she has 3 kids... the kids are Rick, james, and lane, Lane is my father. Lane passed away 10 years ago. My grandma passed away 3 years ago...my grandma left a hand written will. The will has no signatures and no witnesses. She had no possessions of value other than her house. In her will she wrote that everything goes to Rick.....rick sold the house for 300k however the courts will not let him cash the check...the courts threw the case into probate and says that acording to washington law the money needs to be split between Rick, james and, Lane...however because Lane is dead the courts now say I am legally entitled to his portion...rick does not want to share i guess you could say, and has been fighting the courts with a lawyer for 3 years...i was just notified of this a week ago. What should i do? And can i get this money without lawyering up. I have had no idea about the case, they have purposely kept me out of the loop for 2 years in hopes of winning by default. And I'm pissed.... It appears that the will has not been accepted as valid by the court, so that rather than passing to Rick, The estate will pass to your grandmothers intestate heirs, which include you because your father pre-deceased grandma. Rick is likely trying to get the court to except the will as valid. Best bet is to hire an attorney who can investigate this and protect your rights. It is possible that if you fail to take action he might win by default. You can if he gives you the money willingly. Otherwise, you will need to hire an attorney. The term "lawyering up" is annoying to attorneys, FYI.
