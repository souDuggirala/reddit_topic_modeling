Recently I have experienced bouts of horrible insomnia. I think it is due to the fact that my new neighbor is burning a lot of incense. The landlord has told my neighbor to cease burning the incense as it's against the lease agreement, however last night I was awoken by the smell of burning incense. When I asked my neighbor if they were burning incense they denied it. If I go to the doctor to get my insomnia treated and it turns out that the incense is at fault, do I have a case for suing to recoup the costs of the diagnosis? I.E CT scans, blood work, etc?  psychosomatic

If you believe there is an illegal substance being used, call the police and let them deal with the witch. Or...you know...drop a house on her. Signed, Glenda Have you called the police and told them you believe illegal substances from your neighbor's apartment are affecting you? I have a hepa filter and carbon filter running 24-7. This is wierd incense, my neighbor is a witch. Yes, you read the correctly. The incense seems to have slight psychoactive effects and I have charged my heart rate and it goes through the roof when she lights the stuff. I can't imagine how a doctor would diagnose you with insomnia induced by incense. Get a deodorizer near your bed. Honestly I would try to get them to stop before you even start getting medical tests done. Harass the building managers into getting them to quit and see if your insomnia gets better.  You're going to have to prove its not only incense and that neighbor's incense. Uphill battle
