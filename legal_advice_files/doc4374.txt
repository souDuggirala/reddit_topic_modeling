 I work on a third party site (client) on behalf for my employer and have a client issued laptop and employer issued laptop. I sent several emails containing confidential data from my clients'/third parties' laptop to my: i) personal email address ii) company email address I thought it was fine sending certain type of documents (work that I have done for the client on the client's laptop) to my company email address, but also made the mistake of sending it to my personal email address . I sent it because I wanted to do work on my personal or company laptop whilst I didn't have access to my client's laptop (I was going away for extended leave and had to store the client issued laptop with a colleague). Initially it was to my company laptop but the email bounced due to size limits and I sent the same emails in haste to my personal laptop. I thought it was fine sending high level/summarized work documents and outputs which was work I produced, as long as it didn't contain granular data but I found out after the incident that I can't send anything out. The issue is: i) I mistakenly did not take out certain confidential information when I sent the emails; I was not careful when I zipped up the files to only include the high level work documents and summarized outputs ii) I signed a contract with the client saying NOTHING should be sent out from their laptop to external mail address (i didn't read the full contract and just signed it which is my fault) iii)My employment contract has a clause on obligation of confidentiality which I believe is breached I have already met and explained the situation to the the client and my employer about what was sent out( to my best ability/memory) and showed them I have deleted it off my personal email and company email. Also explained to them that there was no malicious intent on my part. I am being investigated by my own company for misconduct and wanted to ask , will I be sued by anyone? /r/LegalAdviceUK is going to be more knowledgeable about the pertinent laws. But this sounds like a situation beyond the realm of online legal advice
