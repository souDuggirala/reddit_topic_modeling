 I work with a small sporting organisation that has been in the process of eliminating paper and going electronic with the Google platform. All of our membership forms are now done through Google Forms and kept in Google Sheets. I was wondering if our consent forms, mainly that of the media waiver, will hold its legal standing if you check an "I agree" box, as opposed to the old-fashioned signing of paper.  Never, but I want it kept that way.  Well first of all how often do you have to take people to court? Do you have any suggestions? Or just keep it simple and stick to paper? Maybe. The storage medium is not the issue but rather if it came down to it how can you prove the person that signed it was who they said they were?
