 This is me asking for my girlfriend. Her parents made an error on the FAFSA, leaving a question blank that asked about their eligibility for a 1040EZ. For some reason, this error wasn't caught by FAFSA or our university, and she was offered a grant of $6000 that would be dispersed over three academic quarters. Unaware of the error, she accepted it and has been financially planning around it. She has received $4000 of $6000, but the error has been caught, and she is being asked to pay back the entirety of the $4000 she received, and obviously won't be receiving any money for Spring quarter. Does she have any options here? She and her parents can't afford to pay back $4000 out of pocket like this. Also I apologize if this is the wrong place for this. This might belong in PersonalFinance or FinancialAdvice, but it didn't seem quite right in either of those either.  I would also set up a meeting with someone in the financial aid office, they might be able to offer university grants. I messed up filling out a cal grant form resulting in my financial aid package missing a good chunk of my tuition. I met with Fin Aid, tried to remedy the situation retroactively, and ultimately nothing could be done but the university came through and matched what my cal grant wouldâ€™ve been.  It is a pell grant. Thanks for the confirmation, I figured this would be the case.   The only real thing to address is whether it's treated as an FSA overpayment (which is a Federal debt and restricts future Federal aid until it is paid back) or if the school is paying it back and then trying to collect from the student. Either way, the money is going to have to be paid back. She can take out a student loan to pay it back.
