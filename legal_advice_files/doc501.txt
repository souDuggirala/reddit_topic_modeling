 I was working as a temp through a staffing agency and my former coworker is full time at the company. Blue collar work. Friday my coworker and I were having our daily friendly (but coarse) banter that even management had partaken in. He snapped and went serious. He said he would stab me outside of work. He said it twice. Off camera, he spat on the back of my neck. (Convicted felon, knife scars all over) I went to management. They took my story and someone whom I thought was a witness. They took my coworkers story this Monday. HR did not believe I was in danger even after I told them that he continued to harass me throughout the work day Monday and that I did not feel safe working in the same area. I have a better than perfect record and multiple character witnesses describing me positively. I got a call today saying that the company requested that my employment be terminated. I've spoken with my managers and they cannot believe I was fired and my coworker was not. I already have another job lined up so I'm not worried about being fired, just about my coworker not having been fired as well. Is there any legal recourse, suit/action I can take against the company I was placed at, temp agency, or am I SOL? Is filing a police report against my coworker a viable option?  Not a lawyer but in Ohio here. We're an at will state so an employer could fire you for any reason, plus you're a temp. About all you can do is file a police report.  You're SOL. You can fire a temp for almost any reason. Move on.
