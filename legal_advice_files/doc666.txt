 Cited for 59 in a 45 in Chamblee, GA. The second speeding offense of my life, the other one was August of 2016 for which I took a class and paid a fine and that was the end of it. Fine for this one is only $150, is it worth hiring an attorney over? 4 lane road, laser, have until end of march. Always fight speeding tickets. It’s not like you will have legal grounds to contest the charge, but that doesn’t mean you can’t get an attorney to have the ticket reduced, PBJ, or some other remedy. 15 over will most likely raise your insurance rates as well.  If your guiding principal is to give the govt as little money as possible, don’t speed.  Except that if you go to court, you'll also be saddled with court costs etc...so this is not really a wonderful position. I mean do you. But you won't win, you'll be out attorney fees, lose time at work to be at the courthouse, and you'll have to pay a fine.  Out of a matter of principle, I would rather spend more to ensure the government "earns" less. There is a limit to this, however... Is your goal to spend as little money as possible on this, or to have the best shot at a clean driving record and lowest insurance rates possible? If the latter, consult a traffic attorney. If the former, just pay the ticket. Lol. No. You were going essentially 15 over the posted speed limit. Just pay your fine
