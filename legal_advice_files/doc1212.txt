 I live in Pennsylvania and today I was late for school and parked in front of a driveway by mistake. When I got to my car there was a note saying that my plate number was reported to the police. If it gets to the point where I have to I'll take responsibility and admit I made a mistake, I just want to know what to expect ticket wise. Could I possibly make it better by leaving like $100 in an envelope in their mailbox as an apology? I would still pay a ticket I just feel bad for what I've done. I've dealt with people blocking my driveway and it sucks, I wouldn't want anyone to have to go through that.  Even if it was an empty threat I might go put like $50'in an envelope in their mailbox for the trouble. I feel like Ike an absolute dick You probably incurred an empty threat.
