 Hello everyone, I'm new to the business world and am currently in my first real person job. I'm going to keep details to a minimum in case someone from my job happens to read this, doubt that would happen, but rather safe than sorry. Let's start with this: I made the mistake of taking a job without asking about salary/benefits (yes I get that this was a stupid decision but I was desperate for a job). Anyways, I was informed that I'd be considered an "individual contractor" (1099) but as weeks and months go by, I'm starting to think that my company is blatantly treating us like employees but calling us "independent contractors" to get a tax break. Here were the biggest red flags to me: \-they've just implemented "set business hours" that we need to work and are now getting on to us if we leave before them \-they're providing office space for us and have moved away from allowing us to choose where we do our work \-we have retainer hours but we're paid hourly every 2 weeks. Any hours we work that are over our retainer are to be used for "sick days"/"vacation days". Not to mention they have us all at 30 hour retainers but expect us to work at least 40 hours every week despite the retainer And with all of that, I really hate my job. I've wanted to quit for 2 months now and have been quietly looking for other jobs. This suspicion of my company misclassifying us as ICs has also made things worse. But I hate to be that person to quit before 6 months because I don't want to let the company down or have it reflect poorly on me. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't really know what to do and if anyone has any advice about this independent contractor situation or leaving my job so soon, that'd be sick.  Sounds like you are an employee to me. The best thing to do is 1) file [Form SS-8](); 2) look for a new job; and 3) sock away some money for taxes you might owe since they aren't withholding.
