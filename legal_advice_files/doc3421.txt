 My employer wants me to sign a non-compete and I need advice on how to proceed. I work for a small concrete staining and sealing company in California. Basically we paint concrete pool decks and interior floors. I've worked here for 3 years but I get laid off from mid December until mid March. By boss has recently started developing his own concrete sealer to shift away from application and start selling our own product. I've never been involved with this side of the company but I am in charge of the application side of the business. I only make $800 a week and have zero benefits, but I also only work 30 hours a weeks to go to school at night. I'm about half way to my transfer degree in earth science so when I go to a UC I most likely won't be working for this company after that. Should I just bite the bullet and sign? Should I try to get a good raise for signing? O totally forgot I'm laid off right now so I'm not even technically working for the company right now and he wants me to sign it. Sweet so I'll try to work a small raise out of it and sign. Ha. California doesn't recognize Non-Competes. They're automatically void. Non-competes agreements are not valid in California. Period.
