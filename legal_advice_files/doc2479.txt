 I moved out of my old apartment in the weeks leading up to me quitting the job. At no point during my employment did I ever get a paycheck sent home, so by the time I was notified that my paycheck was available I was fully expecting to pick it up from the store. Because I was planning on leaving anyway, I admittedly did not inform my boss of my address change. I did not expect this to be an issue because at no point was I notified that my final paycheck would explicitly be mailed. He is now saying that if I want my check, I personally am going to have to pay to cancel and reissue the check. Is his claim correct that, in this instance, it falls entirely on myself to pay the fee? If not, what is the best way to approach this situation so that I can collect my paycheck without having to pay extra? I am fairly new to the workforce so forgive me if this seems like a trivial question. Any help I can recieve is much appreciated.  Thank you :) good luck! Thank you for your insight- I will be sure to keep you updated. You can do it online now, just cost a dollar since they use a debit or credit card to verify name and new address (this obviously only works if you changed your address for that card though)  Unfortunately I did not- I will be sure to do so tomorrow. Did you file a change of address with USPS? Because if this was a recent move they should still be providing mail forwarding. It might take a couple days, especially with the holiday, but you'll get it.
