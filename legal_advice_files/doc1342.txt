 Hi LA, throwaway for anonymity. First, this is a question for within Australia. The situation: Mother/Father in-law have been married for 30+ years, they had several children early on and then separated over a decade ago. The issue is they never got a divorce, FIL just moved away and started a new life (has a new partner and I believe intends to divorce my MIL and marry her soon). Since they have still been legally married, FIL has walked in from time to time and stomped all over MIL taking her money saying "Its his right". This stresses MIL out very much, but she is scared to act and stand up. My wife says he was a very abusive father to both MIL and children alike who had zero role in their upbringing nor a job for any sort of financial input. He relied solely on taking from MIL earnings and she worked whilst raising kids. My concern is that he will apply for a divorce, swoop in and claim 50% of her assets and leave. He truely and genuinely believes he is entitled to her belongings/assets and believes he was a great father to his children (all kids disagree). Question time. As per title, what are the procedures for the divison of assets within Australia? Will it be possible for MIL to keep all her assets through divorce? I have tried reading family court information and federal laws, but i cant make much sense of it. Is someone able to dumb it down before I fork out cash for lawyers for MIL. Thanks I was unaware! Thanks :) Probably better to try r/AusLegal since this subreddit is only geared to the USA.
