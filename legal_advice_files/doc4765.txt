 I work at a Wal-Mart distribution center in Ca. They gave me mandatory overtime for thanksgiving and told me If I didn't come in I would have to use my ca. protected time to cover the hours or I would be written up for attendance. I called out and used my protected time to cover the hours. Now, my question is do they have to pay me at the overtime rate or my regular hourly wage rate for the hours I used? When working in retail, you are expected to work when they need ya. Holiday or not, if they want you to come in, you better be there. The part asking for scheduled time off in lieu is basically your manager giving you the nod that it was okay for you not to work that day due to being off. If walmart wants to pay you extra hours in a payperiod for booking time off on a normal day off -- some work the system for this benefit. Koodos! You would only be eligible for OT on hours worked in the day/week for OT. No worries. A lot of people don't realize how few protections there really are for employees in terms of things like schedules.  Holiday pay isn't a legal requirement. Time off is pretty much always paid at straight time.  Overtime is based on hours worked. There is never a time when you have to be paid leave at the overtime rate. Regular rate per CA law.
