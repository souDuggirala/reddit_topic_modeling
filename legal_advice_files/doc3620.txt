 Not me, a friend. Last night there was a bit of a scuffle at a night club. Long story short after the police reports were processed the other party decided to drop charges of simple assault, but couldnâ€™t because it was already processed. They gave me their contact information, to try and sort things out. Do we contact them or just wait for the court date in a couple weeks?  Absolutely not. Never contact the alleged victim of a crime. Contacting that person could be seen as an effort to intimidate them or interfere with them. This can lead to additional criminal charges. I don't care if the person agreed to the contact. You never know what they will claim happened. Not only should your friend not contact the person, no one else should contact them either. Your friend should retain a lawyer. The lawyer can contact the person. Thank you for the advice.  Yes, even then.  Even when they consented to the contact? You should not contact the victim, at all, for any reason. Doing so could be yet another criminal charge.
