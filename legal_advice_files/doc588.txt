 Frederick, MD - I attend a private high school. Recently the school has installed several security cameras within the buildings on campus. One of these cameras seems to be able to see into the girl's bathroom when the door is opened. Another camera can most definitely see into the boy's bathroom when the door is opened. The cameras were installed mid-school year without notifying either the parents or the students of the school. Furthermore, the cameras record audio as well as video. There are no signs posted or any other indication of the use of such cameras. The student handbook makes no mention of cameras or any other form of surveillance. I believe the cameras have been installed in response to rumors of students vaping in the bathrooms. No students have actually been found guilty of vaping, however. Is the school allowed to install and operate such cameras in their current configuration (seeing into the bathrooms when the doors are opened)? What are the possible legal repercussions the school could suffer?  Unless multiple administrators, budget planners, and multiple professionals who install cameras for a living all chose to ignore privacy laws, it's legal.  Completely legal as long as the cameras are not in stalls/aimed directly at urinals. The school has no legal obligation to notify anyone of new security measures. This is just shooting from the hip but...assuming the cameras can see no more than a passerby in the hall would it's probably legal.
