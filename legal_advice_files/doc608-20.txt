Update: So just got off the phone with the property manager and they evicted him yesterday for scamming multiple people.

I paid him $2,000 in cash for rent + security deposit. This is in Los Angeles. 

I have his name, phone number, emails and resume/work history found from his Linked in. 

Any advice? Should I just file a police report? Do you have a previous post to link to so we know what you're talking about? [removed] [removed]
