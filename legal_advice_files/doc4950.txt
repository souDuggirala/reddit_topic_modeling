 One of my friend's little brother got in trouble with private school over the possession and distribution of marijuana. He's around 16. No prior offence. The school is still investigating as of the moment. What are some option besides getting a lawyer? What would be a realistic plea if charges was pressed? Your best option is to get a lawyer that the best and really only option. No one can answer this without knowing what the charges are. If he is charged, he needs a lawyer.
