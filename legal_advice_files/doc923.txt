 Hey all, I unfortunately was pulled over and given a ticket for speeding (69 in a 55) and wanted to see what my options were. I planned on going to court to see about fighting it for a few reasons. 1) there was no sign posted saying 55. 2) I was keeping up with the flow of traffic but he just happened to make a u turn and pull me over. 3) I have been driving for about 8 years now and have never been pulled over. When I asked why I couldn’t receive just a warning because this is my first time he stated I’ve only been driving here for a month (I recently moved here) and “it’s not like I’ve been driving for 30 years” I thought that was a bad view from the officer but elected not to argue with him. I’ve now received a ton of junk mail from attorneys offering their services but I’m not sure what route to take. Do I go to fight it myself or hire an attorney? Hire one of the lawyers. None of your arguments will work in court.  From experience: a million lawyers will send mail to you. Choose one of them and pay them to take it off your record. You'll pay about $200 but they'll go to court for you, get it off your record, and your insurance won't go up. Otherwise a judge will not care about anything you've presented here.
