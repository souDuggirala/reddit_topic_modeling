 I’m a college student currently renting out a house near campus with friends, and my room has been very cold for the past couple months. The room is essentially a porch that has been renovated slightly but there is no insulation in the floor and minimal in the walls so even with a space heater and furnace constantly running my room averages about 55F degrees, dipping as low as 36F. I’ve been wearing winter jackets to sleep and do homework but other than that I try to avoid being in there. I texted my landlord and he said that it’s just because it’s been so cold lately and that he has no plans of adding insulation. Is there anything I can do about this? Any help is appreciated.
