 So this goes back to about January 3rd, possibly was going on for longer. On January 3rd, I looked up at my ceiling and noticed a spot of mold growing there. First instinct was to go upstairs to the neighbors to see if they had a leak in the general area above the spot (they did) and the same day they contacted their property manager to come out and look at it. Weeks pass, cut forward to Saturday (the 26th) and I go up again to try to find out any updates. They contact their property manager again, and come to find that somehow within 3 weeks the manager has changed, and this guy comes same day and gets someone to look at it and fix the leak. We speak to him the same day and he is already trying to get out of it, including literally telling me to just "paint over the mold to get rid of it," but the other problem is that water from the leak has made it's way under my laminate floor and has caused major damage to it. He comes back again today (the 28th) and is trying to say "the leak was only reported on Saturday" and because of that they can't be responsible. On the 23rd we had someone look at it and say it's been going for a while and definitely coming from upstairs. We have proof of contact between us and the HOA from as far back as the 3rd. After he left I went back and spoke to the neighbors and they told me what they told him was they knew about it for weeks, yet what he had told me was they said they only knew about it since Saturday. The HOA had corresponded with the old property manager and said it was their responsibility to pay for it. Tl;dr Leak happened upstairs, caused damage to my property, owner of upstairs trying to weasel out of responsibility for damages
