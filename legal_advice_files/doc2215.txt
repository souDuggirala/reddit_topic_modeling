 From what I can gather this woman (middle aged to older) lived here at one point with her family members. In fact, I still get mail for about 4 different people which I all mark as “return to sender, no such person lives here.” Anyways, all the mail I get for this one woman is obviously from bill collectors. I’m guessing she must live with her family and not be responsible for any utilities and therefore hasn’t changed her legal address. Maybe because of her major debt problems her family has decided to never change her legal address, I don’t know. But I have no way of contacting her or of knowing WITH WHOM or WHERE she lives. And now I’m getting people showing up banging on the door trying to serve her court papers I’m assuming. They say they’ll return. Any advice on how to proceed? Both with the people trying to serve her papers and with getting her to stop using my address as her legal address?? Put up a sign that says "No Trespassing" and "(lady's name) Does Not Live Here". Call the police everytime somebody you don't know bangs on the door.
