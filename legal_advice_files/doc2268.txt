 Recently purchased a four day live in-class course for a friend of mine. They messaged today saying that due to low turnout, the course will not be going ahead. They have offered alternatives that are of less quality and are insufficient monetarily. What rights/ Avenues do I have in this situation. Ideally the course would go ahead, can I make this happen contractually? No I dont want a refund, it was an expensive gift and I wanted her to have the course. Ive tried talking to them but have received no response Did you ask them for a refund? They're not obligated to provide you the class, as long as they don't keep your money.  Probably not. Most likely you agreed to some terms that covered these exact circumstances. Go read whatever you accepted.
