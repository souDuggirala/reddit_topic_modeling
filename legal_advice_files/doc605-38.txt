Location: Ontario Canada.

A few years ago a family tore down the house beside ours and built something new. We live on a small hill (very small incline), and house is on slightly higher ground than us.

During the new house build and landscaping, they significantly raised the grading of their land. They also removed a few large trees on the property. Ever since, during rainfall or snow water flows off their property (and roof) right into our house. We have spent well over $10K fixing flooded areas including the basement.

They are currently doing more landscaping which is making the problem worse. After last nights rain our whole backyard has turned into a swamp - we can’t sit out there anymore and will need to pay professionals to fix the flowerbeds and lay more soil.

We have contacted the homeowners many times, tried to contact the constructing and landscaping companies they use, and even wrote a letter to the city.

Is there anything else we can do to have them stop lifting the grade of their property? Or get some relief for the financial burden this has caused?

Edit: spelling and clarification on flooding areas Thank you!! You can sue for this, actually. Its in your neighbours best interest to solve this now.  See this page fro the government, and [http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/landuse/drain-eref/surface.htm](http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/landuse/drain-eref/surface.htm) and a case where someone was awarded significant damages: [https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/neighbour-must-pay-390k-in-damages-for-flooded-property-appeal-court](https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/neighbour-must-pay-390k-in-damages-for-flooded-property-appeal-court)

Try 311 again, and ask for the name of the person you should speak to. But if that doesn't work you'll need a real estate lawyer. Thanks, we have called 311 in the past and they said they’d “look into it”... never heard back unfortunately Your city likely has something like 311 or bylaw enforcement, call them and ask for someone to come out and check on the renovation.
