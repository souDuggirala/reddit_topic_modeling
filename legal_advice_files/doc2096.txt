 The place I work has a tendency to post the schedule 2-3 days before the schedule starts. Last week we got it 2:30pm the day before the schedule starts (store opens at 7am). I’m just wondering because it’s getting kind of hard to plan things in the week without knowing when I’ll be working.  Thank you, I really appreciate this! Legislation to change the law to provide employees with notice before a shift change or schedule was introduced a few years ago, but as of today, MN has no law regulating this and your employer is free to change or notify you of your schedule with little to no notice.
