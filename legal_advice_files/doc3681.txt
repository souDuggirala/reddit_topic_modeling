 I filed a formal EEO complaint. The acceptance of the complaint is imminent. It will be investigated. HOw important is it to have an attorney during the investigative process. I will obtain an attorney for the hearing.. BUt do i need to get one this early in the process Often the EEOC will give you a right to sue letter if they feel there is at least some merit to the case. You may want to consult now with an attorney to have your ducks in a row, since you only have a short time to bring suit once you get the right to sue letter.
