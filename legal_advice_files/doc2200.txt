 As the title says... I named my company a word that I thought I made up. Quickly I found that others made it up also, but there was no other company named exactly what I wanted. So I hopped on it in early 2016. I got somewhat established as a company since 2016 in the license process. I sell products to retail shops currently and will be looking to expand into more products in the future and want to make my brand solid and distinguishing. Today I was running a random word search online through US trademarks and my company name came up. It is in a similar realm of business but not identical. Should I change my business name? Thank you :)  Thanks for your advice, it is appreciated. I have the .com and the Twitter/Facebook/Instagram social media in my possession. They only have the trademark on the word.  If someone has trademarked it then probably good idea to change it. Have you done the following.... This is always a good thing to do whenever making a business name.... Buy the www..com address also the. Com.your country extention, also tlall the social media pages or at least the main ones like Facebook and Instagram. If any of those things are already taken then it's normally a good idea to find a different name, because the one that's already there is going to be where potential customers end up instead of your place.
