 So my partner took a lift home and the Lyft driver invited himself into her home. She obviously declined. How do we ensure the proper authorities know about this, and how do we make sure this doesnâ€™t happen again?  Thank you for you logical and considerate answer. This perspective is rare on Reddit. Especially with all the trumpets around.  Then complain to lyft. This isn't a legal issue.  Find him and whip his ass... thatâ€™s what Iâ€™d do  I donâ€™t really care if he broke a law or not. I just donâ€™t think he should be a driver. Asking to go into someone's house is not a crime. Nor is hitting on a woman. I imagine Lyft may not be happy. Your partner can complain to Lyft. Like others have said, he didn't commit a crime, so notifying Lyft and potentially getting him fired is likely your only recourse. But I would add that many drivers work for both Uber and Lyft, so you may want to contact both. The police /authorities do not care about a dude hitting on a chick. That's not illegal.  âœ‹ðŸ˜©âœ‹ I know, thatâ€™s what I said.  It's super unprofessional, if she felt unsafe she should report all the behavior to Lyft  Your partner should contact the customer service department of Lyft and if she feels for her safety then a call to the local authorities wouldnâ€™t hurt.  Report it to Lyft.
