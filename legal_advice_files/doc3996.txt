 I’m not going to do this cause it’s just hair but if I wanted to will I be able to sue a place like ihop if I found hair in my food? Troll. Removed.  [removed] [removed] Unless you found the hair by choking on it so severely someone had to call the ambulance to take you to the ER to get it surgically removed from your throat resulting in a $10,000 hospital bill.... No. Just finding a hair is not enough to successfully sue a restaurant.  [removed] If it was so easy to get a payday from finding a hair in your food, without specific damages, and without showing negligence, then restaurants wouldn't exist. If you find a hair in your meal at a restaurant, send it back. If they refuse, at most you would be able to prevail in small claims court for the cost of the meal. [removed] You can sue for whatever your damages are. Meaning what this hair cost you, which is likely to be nothing, aside from the cost of the meal itself, which any restaurant is almost certainly going to remake or refund for you.  What medical bills were incurred from finding the hair and how much psychological post care was required to make sure they were emotionally sound? The person can sue for that dollar amount. The dollar amount is 0.  Yes, but you’re probably more interested in whether you’re likely to get a judgment for damages in your favor.  [removed] what are your damages?
