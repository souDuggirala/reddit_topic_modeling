 My friend works for a national, employee friendly, grocery store. He had some soreness from working in the loading area, and like many other employees, attended a few sessions of insurance-covered acupuncture. He just received a letter from the insurance asking if his treatment was for a work-place injury. He doesnâ€™t know how to respond or what the ramifications of a yes or no answer is. Any insight?
