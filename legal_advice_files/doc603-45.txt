There are two rows of parking, a total of 4 spaces. In summer months, my fiancee and I have parked ours cars on the left ride of the driveway, one behind the other. The neighbors parked in the street. As of December 1st,  they are not allowed to park in the street. They have not parked their cars on the right side (that has always been left open). Although it's annoying, I know we cannot "call dibs" on the left side of our shared driveway. 
The issue is that the neighbors will park their cars in front, leaving my fiancee and I to park behind them and block them in. Are we forced into a position where they could have us towed? 
We are not on good terms with these neighbors. A verbal agreement will not solve this problem. How should we proceed? I had a similar problem at an apartment building in Grand Rapids MI and the landlord had to intervene. Our issue involved one of the business owners that was on the first floor of the building parking in the resident's spots. The landlord was the person who had the authority to designate where the tenants could and could not park, he told the business owner he could not park there and if he continued, he was authorizing the residential tenants to have him towed. Good luck! It got really ugly until the landlord put his foot down. Appeal to the landlord.  Our landlord owns all property. We are both renters, and the lease doesn't mention anything regarding parking. Who owns the units and the parking spaces? Are you all renters? Do the leases not specify any parking? Are you all owners of a townhouse, who owns the parking?
