 An old boss (well call him Joe) of mine recently passed away and one his 9 kids (we will call him Jr) contacted me asking about the will I signed witness to. I have absolutely no recollection of signing it but the handwriting/signature looks like mine. Jr pointed out another person signed with me , (another coworker at the time) and he doesn't recall signing it either. He said that's his signature and handwriting but has no recollection of signing it. Joes wife is a known con artist and owned the business with Joe. That being said, our signatures and the info we allegedly wrote on the contract, she has all of it already from all the paperwork we had to sign at the company, making it much easier to forge/fake. Jr wants me to testify in court tomorrow that I didn't sign it. It clearly states I'm facing purgary (I believe) if I were to lie in court about it. I don't know if I should go to court or not. If I do, I plan on saying the truth: "That appears to be my signature, and that handwriting looks like mine, but I have no recollection of any of this." Is that a good way to go? And If it turns out she did forge my signature on the will am I entitled to some sort of compensation? After Joe died she kicked out all of the 9 kids and the will gives her EVERYTHING while the kids get nothing. She also scammed my father, he started a go fund me for Joes headstone and money to help the family, she took all of it and has yet to buy a headstone (she wont). I am very nervous and i apologize if this is hard to read I'm using mobile. Any advice is greatly appreciated. If it helps, I am located in Indiana. And any additional information any wants, you can message me or just ask. Greatly appreciated. I'm only 25 I don't know the legal system at all. TL;DR A known con artist may have forged my signature on her husband's will and i don't know what to do.
