 I am being sued by CapitalOne for a 4K credit card debt. I do owe the money. I went through a really rough year including hospitalization and loss of a job — hence falling behind on payments. Any advice on how to move forward? I can’t afford to settle with a lump sum. I would like to offer to make monthly payments and possibly settle outside of court— will they laugh at me for this suggestion? Thanks for any help, this has me full of anxiety!! Thank you so much! That is reassuring to hear. Hello! Yes, I contacted them and agreed to make monthly payments— all worked out in the end. Good luck! Hello! Did you ever get resolution with this issue? My parents are in a similar situation and I am trying to figure out how to assist.
