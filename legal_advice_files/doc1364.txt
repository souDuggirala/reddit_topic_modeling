 Hello, reddit. One of my friends is having some problems. His stepmom is kinda crazy, and yesterday I heard she assualted his dad. I asked why his dad hasn't pressed charges, and he said that he tried it before, but when he did she cut herself and blamed it all on him and other false claims. Because of this, he even has an warrant out for his arrest. What can my friend's dad do to press charges and avoid the false claims? That is sad. Clearly this is a toxic and abusive relationship. Until he is ready to break free, y'all cant force him. Unless someone else witnesses the physical abuse. then the witnesses can help.corroborate the dads story.  His dad hasn't done that because he constantly gets guilt tripped into staying. Divorce would be step one.
