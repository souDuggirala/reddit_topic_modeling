 Hello, I hope this is the correct subreddit to post this to, but let me get straight to the point: I worked for a branch of a chain fast food business from July of 2018 until September of 2018, when decided to resign due to seeing some shady business practices. As far as I know, the chain is owned by a small group of entrepreneurs. On January 9th of 2019, I texted one of the owners in regard to my W-2 form, as I had not received it. He read the message, but did not reply. On January 29th, I sent him another text reminding him that he had until January 31st to send me my W-2 Form, or I would have to contact the IRS. He read that as well, but didn't reply until today when he sent my my form. I immediately filed it along with my forms from other businesses. My co-worker that also worked and quit the same time as me was also having troubles receiving his W-2, got his today as well. He thought he noticed some inconsistencies on his form. The amount of taxes it claimed that he paid seemed to be lower than they should've been. I reviewed my form as well and the numbers do seem a little off. I decided to check my ADP app and review the statements and pay-stubs from the period I worked there, but that data was no longer available, as if it had been deleted. Does this seem off to anyone else? What steps can I take to protect myself in this situation, and is it too late to correct my tax information if there was indeed an error? And if this was intentionally malicious, would we be able to build a legal case? Do you have any old pay stubs from physical checks or was the ADP system the one one used (direct deposit) ? Do you have a copy of your old w-4? This may be a bit hard to figure out without the numbers. If you really feel like they are off you can try and contact ADP and see if they have a copy directly.
