 Always wondered this. Not sure if it’s a Canadian thing or not. When charges are stayed is it because they think the accused is in fact guilty, but don’t have enough evidence yet to convict?  Usually to give more time to gather evidence. They might never find anything or the case gets forgotten. It’s basically just away to make people feel better about the fact charges are not being filed on someone by them saying they need more time and will get them in the future. They could one day get the evidence they need or won’t. Also like I said they could also end up forgetting about the case all together. Unless it’s a small area or a major case they usually have hundreds to deal with at a time.  Hmm.. wonder why they would choose to do this rather than leaving the suspect alone (maybe under surveillance so they don’t go on the run)...wait until they have substantial evidence, then move forward with pressing charges. Very weird - thanks for the reply!  Got it now. Thanks!  Your not wrong in your assumption. If they withdraw/drop charges your free and clear. When a charge is stayed they are saying we won’t be Pursuing the case at the time but might at a later date. In the US we do a similar thing the prosecutor keeping the case open but not pressing charges at this time. This can be done after police arrest someone or they could say not to arrest them we don’t have any “real” evidence to convict. Sometimes the police do something like that by saying we know this person did it but can’t prove it so they are marked at the prime suspect but no arrest or charges. It happens but then even if your innocent you still have to watch your back cause they could come for you anytime.  There's a good explanation here: [http://lawfacts.ca/node/195](http://lawfacts.ca/node/195) As you suspected, the difference is that for a period of 1 year, a stayed charge can be revived.
