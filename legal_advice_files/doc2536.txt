 My husband is being sued in small claims court in California along with his ex-girlfriend by their former landlord. The landlord is suing for utilities not paid. The landlord never charged for utilities until the end of their lease and it was like 7000. QUESTIONS: 1.Can I represent him in small claims court ? 2.Is there a way to have their cases split up? I hate her and am petty AF and would prefer to settle this issue separately from her. 3.If we lose the case, will they just collect the money 50/50 ? Does someone have more responsibility than the other? 1. No. Small claims court is for unrepresented people. It can be moved to district court (or whatever ya'll have in California) if a lawyer is to enter an appearance and represent one of the parties. What you are suggesting is actually illegal - unauthorized practice of law. 2. No. They were on the lease together so this is a joint debt. It saves everyone's time to address this in one matter. Plus, in small claims court no one is going to know how to properly petition for severance anyway, not that it would be granted. 3. It's actually most likely they are jointly and severally liable which means they would each be responsible for half of the debt but the landlord could go after either for the full amount (and then that person could go after their other co-tenant). Don't be petty. You won presumably. You got the guy.
