 Good evening all! I wish i could say i was pleased to be here, but not very much. On 12/29/18 i arrived back to Chicago and requested an Uber. The driver arrived quickly, i boarded, and we headed towards my house. It being VERY early in the morning (red eye), i rolled with whichever route the driver took, but upon looking back, realize he was doing several loops and turnarounds. Whatever. I arrived at my destination, grabbed my luggage, and groggily gave the driver a five star review. I slept for a few hours, but upon waking up and searching for my wallet, and work keycard, realized I'd left my coat in the Ubers car. I attempted to contact the driver a few times, to no avail, until 12/31/18, when he finally picked up and stated that he would not be available to return my coat until tomorrow. I understood and driver stated he would text me with details and hung up. Since then I've yet to receive any contact with the driver, and when i call it goes straight to voicemail. In my wallet i has two credit cards, debit card, a $100 dollar gift card, and about $47 in cash. My coat is also worth a decent amount (higher hundreds), but what i am most interested in recovering is the dog tag of my recently deceased pet. What are my steps going forward? I cannot express the sadness i feel at losing my dogs tag, and do not care about money amount (although it does hurt), as much as i want to get my tag back. Reddit, what are my options?  You need to tell uber and keep bugging the driver. If that doesn't work you sue him in small claims. You may or may not win.  Did you report the lost items through the app?
