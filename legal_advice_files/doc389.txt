 My husband and I recently signed a lease agreement for an apartment. We are interested in finding a cheaper apartment as our finances will soon be limited to only one of us working full-time. Admittedly, we felt rushed and signed/made the deposit far too quickly (our current lease will be jumping to a little over $900.00 in about a month and a half). Upon further inspection of the property, we discovered a host of issues and no longer feel comfortable living here (huge holes under the kitchen cabinets when you pull the drawers away, AC units plugged in via drop cords and 2-prong outlets, baseboard heaters missing dials, and such). I don't think the 3-Day Rescinding thing qualifies for rental situations, but we are curious if some of these other issues could qualify us to exit the lease, even if it means losing the deposit etc. To clarify, we signed yesterday (2-8-19). We are in NC. Thoughts? You didn't inspect the property beforehand? To me just sounds like you want to back out of the deal because you found something cheaper. Contracts once signed don't work that way. There is no three day cooling off period in this instance. Presumably you could have discovered those items prior to signing. You can try to negotiate an early exit but expect to pay a few months rent at least.  None of those issues amount to reasons to break the lease, I'm afraid. The penalties for breaking the lease early should be spelled out in the lease itself.
