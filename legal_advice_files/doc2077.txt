 I want to start a business that sells research chemicals online but it seems like it is a legal grey area. From my research I have found that they are not illegal to sell as long as they are not for human consumption. I’ve noticed many sellers are based in Canada but still can legally ship to the us. So I’m wondering if it’s legal to sell research chemicals domestically given they are not intended for human consumption.  That's like a drug dealer telling a cop, "No officer. I'm selling this cocaine. I'm giving it for free with these fancy decorative boxes I'm selling". No one would believe that (and believe me, its been tried) and no one will believe you either. You should look up the Federal Analogue act: This makes many "research chemicals" illegal to sell or possess without special certification/licensing/etc. RCPowders. That's as likely to work against you as in your favor. Having the disclaimer in place could be seen as a tacit acknowledgement that you knew your products could be abused. Can you provide an example of such a case? I'm willing to bet everyone who is in jail for running a website like this had a similar disclaimer. What if the website would have a warning that says “for research purposes only” and “not for human consumption” It's not a legal grey area at all. It's legally an area where shady businesses sling chemicals that are "not" meant for human consumption to people who have no education or background in chemistry. The entire industry is based on a thin layer of implausible deniability, which is why so many of these people go to jail. Yes, it's legal to sell research chemicals. It's how research is done. No, it's not legal to sell drugs to abusers in the way that you're likely to do.
