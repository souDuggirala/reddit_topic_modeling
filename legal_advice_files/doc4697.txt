 In Wisconsin. Building was recently sold to a new owner. I have been in the same apartment for 7 years with no issues. My new landlord just recently sent out an e-mail that they will now only be accepting payments and maintenance requests through this online portal that they are requiring tenants to sign up for? Is this legal? I have been paying by check for 7 years and would like to continue that. I'm also not too keen if there is a maintenance emergency to go online and file a request and hope it's seen... If it matters, I have not signed a lease with new owners, my lease is with the old owner which they took over and runs through 6/19. So I have not agreed that I would only pay rent online. Thanks!  What does your lease say about payment methods? They can't change the terms until renewal, so this will be your biggest ally.
