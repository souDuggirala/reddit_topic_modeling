 Hello legaladvice! Here's the story: My girlfriend and I are full time college students and are both 22 years old. She recently told me that her parents filed for bankruptcy - and by what she said, I am assuming they filed during the summer of 2017. Their bankruptcy case was approved - I am unfamiliar with how it works but I know they were successful in order to alleviate some of their debts. Part of their terms included that they couldn't open any new credit card accounts. My girlfriend started receiving emails that her credit score was going down. She has a credit card that she pays off every month and is very responsible for her own money. So this is where the suspicions rose. After some inquiry, she found out that her parents opened a credit card in her name to buy an oven that was around $500. These were purchased March 2018. Since then, they have missed multiple payments on the credit card and have gathered late fees - affecting my girlfriend's credit score. Her mom makes minimum payments around every other month so she can keep making purchases on this card. My girlfriend is going to get a Masters degree next fall and has terrible credit because of her parents. She doesn't know how she will get an apartment, car, so on because of this credit score hanging on her. My question is - what can be done here? Can I anonymously report her parents? My girlfriend won't do anything about it because she is afraid to. I am so frustrated for her and don't want her parents to keep going down this road.  She needs to lock her credit so her parents can't open new lines of credit in her name. She should also try contacting that credit card company and at least closing it so no new charges can be added. Then she needs to either file a police report for the ID theft, or accept that she is going to have bad credit and thus higher interest rates and insurance premiums until she can get that line of credit paid off.
