 As an SC resident can I buy a gun from a GA resident without an FFL transfer? I can legally own a gun. If not, can I purchases the gun from the GA resident, then drive it myself to an SC FFL to finish the transfer, or does it have to be taken to the SC FFL via the owner or shipped from a GA FFL? The ATF got back to me and you're right. The GA resident can transfer the long gun to a GA FFL and then they transfer it to me without it having to be shipped to an SC FFL. [removed] No. You can only buy from a dealer or have it shipped to a FFL in sc Not familiar with SC private sales... In GA, physically, private sales do not require FFL. Shipped, postage not personal transport, between states require FFL. If you buy it online between states and have it shipped, it requires FFL. Federal rule is you can buy a long gun from a dealer out of state but a pistol has to be shipped to an FFL in your home state to do the transfer. Don't buy private sale in person. Have it shipped to SC FFL.
