 I have a whole lot of issues with my job. There are many health violations and laws being broken, such as misclassification of workers against our will (without us ever seeing paperwork, and being lied to about being employees) and I have no clue where I stand in the legal grey area. My first concern is serving alcohol. I have a class 13 permit, and am 18. This is A coffee shop and I’m the only working during my shift. I am expected to serve alcohol, regardless. Am I at fault here? My follow up concern is - what can I do about being misclassified? I have expressed my concerns with my employer already, to no avail. Thanks guys!  Thanks!! I could only assume so. You boss cannot legally force you to break the law so it would only be logical for you to be protected (though I cannot confirm) Is there anything protecting me if I get fired for refusing to serve alcohol illegally? If you serve alcohol, you will in fact be at fault. Honestly, I would expose your boss because it sounds like he does that a lot and doesn’t care
