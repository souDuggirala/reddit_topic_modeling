 So I’m only just finding out about this, my 13 year old cousin just got a tattoo that says “fuck off love mom” on her hip. I’m fairly certain this is illegal in my state (Virginia) and I want to report it but they live in Norfolk and I live about 40 miles away from DC so there is a bit of distance between us. This is one of the many really really shitty things my aunt has done and I kinda just wanna see if they can nail her for this. What are the proper legal channels to go through to report this to the people with any authority where they are?  Im assuming it on the inner lip. Those tattoos will fuzz out and fade and no longer be legible after a few years. She will have a blob of ink to show for it in a few years.

If it was my kid, I'd take her to the doc for some bloodwork... No. If she has split custody then wouldn’t she need both parents permission?  Im hip trust me Va. Code §18.2-371.3. Tattooing and Body Piercing of a Minor - Prohibits anyone from tattooing or performing body piercing on a person under age 18, knowing or having reason to believe that the person is under 18 except in the presence of the person's parent or guardian or when done by or under the supervision of a medical doctor, registered nurse, or other medical services personnel in the performance of their duties. Excludes ear piercing as a form of body piercing. Norfolk may have different regs, but I doubt it.  r/trashy If the 13 year old had parent permission, it's legal.
