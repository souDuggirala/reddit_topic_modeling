 This is something I've heard a lot of conflicting information about. I've heard that they need a warrant for anything locked inside of the car (like the glovebox or the trunk), but they do not need a warrant for the rest of the car. Is this true? When they bring a K9 unit out and the dog signals that there's something in the car, is that all they need to produce a warrant? Thanks!  They do not need a warrant if they have probable cause to believe there is contraband or evidence in the vehicle and they've stopped you on traffic. If the car is parked in your driveway or at work or whatever, it's different. They do not need a warrant. It's called the automobile exception and allows law enforcement to search vehicles based on probable cause. The locked glove box thing is not true
