  Was teasing person, person punched me, I punched the person back. The person was sent to the E.R or hospital with an asthma attack What do I do? In california btw  back and attack what where I was not aware, that it would trigger an asthma attack. the individual hit me with about the same force. They threw a pretty hard punch. Full force on their side I believe. Slick rhyme. Those are his choices. I never said it was a good one.  No, do not go to the hospital unless the individual is already a long-standing good friend and this was the result of a misunderstanding. Although the punch can be considered self-defense, going to the hospital can actually be considered intimidation. You can be sympathetic and go see said person, or do nothing. Choice is yours.  Were you aware that punching the individual would cause the asthma attack? Generally, you can you use commensurate force in your own defense. Usually, someone punching you can permit punching them back to defend yourself. If you were aware that punching this individual could cause a severe asthma attack it's possible for them to argue you used excessive force in retaliation. Stop punching people? If the police want to talk to you decline.
