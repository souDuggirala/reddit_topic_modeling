 Hello legaladvice, didn't think I'd ever actually have to make a throwaway to make a post here. Much less a throwaway. In August I signed a lease for this apartment complex for a 12 month term. It's a 3 bedroom unit with 3 residents. It's now January and today we just received notice of new parking requirements / rules within the complex. Failure to meet these requirements and rules results in being towed, along with having to pay all the fees associated with the tow in order to retrieve the vehicle. In the lease, with regards to parking it reads: \ "21. PARKING; VEHICLE USE. We may regulate the time, manner, and place of parking cars, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, boats, trailers, and recreation vehicles by anyone. We may have unauthorized, improperly or illegally parked vehicles towed under an appropriate statute or in conformity with Oregon law. A vehicle is unauthorized, improperly, or illegally parked in the dwelling community if it: (1) has a flat tire or other condition rendering it inoperable; (2) is on jacks, blocks, or has wheel(s) missing; (3) has no current license or no current inspection sticker; (4) takes up more than one parking space; (5) belongs to a Resident or occupant who has surrendered or abandoned the dwelling; (6) is parked in a marked handicap space without the legally required handicap insignia; (7) is parked in a space marked for manager, staff, or guest at the office; (8) blocks another vehicle from exiting; (9) is parked in a fire lane or designated "no parking" area; (10) is parked in a space marked for other Resident(s) or unit(s); (11) is parked on the grass, sidewalk, or patio; (12) blocks garbage trucks from access to a dumpster. The apartment management just sent out the following email: \ EXPERIENCE THE DIFFERENCE Dear Residents, \[Business Name\] is updating the community parking program, which requires all parking BY PERMIT ONLY.

I know that landlords may be able to make reasonable changes to the lease if they're able to based on language in the lease, but to me this seems extremely unfair, if not illegal. In a phone call, one of my room mates was encouraged to have their guests park at Starbucks in a nearby shopping center. This requires the guest to cross streets which I feel opens the complex up to liability if injuries occur. She also states that staff in the office have agreed with her when she stated that these rules were illegal or in violation of the lease we signed in August. Is this legal and if not , what should I do. I wish this applied Mr. Robot.
