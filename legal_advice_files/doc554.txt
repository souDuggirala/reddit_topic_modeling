 My SO and I have been harassed several times spanning over the last few months. Without going too much into detail, someone has been making fake social media accounts and using a Google number to try to make it seem like my SO is cheating (they are not) or vice versa and overall just trying to cause problems between us. My SO thinks it could be an ex that's jealous (but not sure which one) because this has happened to them in previous relationships as well. Other than that, we have no idea who it is. nbsp; They have done everything from spamming my comments section with accusatory messages to messaging people that follow me to tell them to warn me that my SO is up to something. nbsp; The strange part is that they seem to always pop up and then fade away only to come back a few months later. With the way all of this is so long and drawn out, we feel like they are bound to eventually slip up in some way and hopefully this will work to our advantage. Recently, they have resorted to making accounts pretending to be me and contacting people I know saying that my SO cheating and I'm heartbroken, which is obviously untrue. nbsp; Social media is a substantial part of my work so I cannot make my pages private. With that being said, I do want to figure out what sort of legal action I can take. I have been compiling all of the screenshots of comments, messages sent to me by others, text messages, and the Google number they created and file a police report. Is there anything else I should do to try to eventually track this person down and file a restraining order against them? Any advice or suggestions would be very much appreciated. nbsp; TL;DR SO and I being continuously harassed online and over text. I want to file a police report and also want know if there are any other steps I should take or consider.
