 I am in the US. I want to obtain a license agreement to use footage for a film I am producing. There would be nothing in the contract that states derivative works can be made from the footage/edits can be made. Would this mean I am only allowed to use the footage in its raw form? Can a saturation boost breach the contract and open up the possibility of me being sued? I just want to be safe. Any information on this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.  One easy way to be safe is to discuss the matter with the rights holder and ensure the licensing agreement you purchase reasonably describes or includes your intended use.
