 Hi all, I have a question that’s popped up after seeing an acquaintances post on Facebook that made me go ‘huh, wonder if that’s appropriate.’ A person I know recently graduated as a nurse. They’ve added a profile picture to Facebook with a caption that basically makes light of being placed in the colorectal ward, calls it the ‘poo ward’ and makes it out to be their bad luck. Obviously that’s not breaching privacy, and this person is a really lovely human being, but it made me think wow if I somehow stumbled in as a patient after reading that I’d be really embarrassed and uncomfortable to be looked after by someone who was apparently grossed out by their job. It’s got me wondering whether this is acceptable behaviour, and what would constitute a breach of professional standard? My question is more for interests sake than suggesting that this individual has done something wrong. Due to their general oversharing, I know what hospital it is too - and it’s in Australia if it matters at all.  This isn't a legal question. It absolutely could get someone in trouble with their employer.  There's no legal definition of unprofessional, if that's your question. Even people with employment contracts generally have a clause that says "don't embarrass us or we'll fire you."  Acceptable behavior legally? Sure, nothing illegal about it. Acceptable behavior professionally? That's up to their employer. /r/auslegal might be a better place to ask, though.
