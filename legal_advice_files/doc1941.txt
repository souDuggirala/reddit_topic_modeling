 I received a call on my VOIP line from a Debt Collector that was attempting to collect on a debt from 2004. I called them back and of course the call was answered by a gentleman that attempted to use pressure tactics in order to get me to agree to pay a debt ..... a debt that I couldn't possibly owe, the car that he was speaking of was paid off after a collision that left it totaled in the winter of 2003. I've managed to track down a bit of information about the scam artist, it's a VOIP phone number 1.714.591.8134 With a toll-free number, 1.888.265.6346, that's apparently blocked on the information I can attain from it on the internets. Caller: Western Assets Call type: Debt collector I managed to track down the name of the company and its location in Irvine, CA, but I can't for the life of me figure out which agency in California I should report this to. These guys disturbed my 83-year-old grandmother, and I'd like to see them shut down. I'm quite willing to dedicate a small hill of hours to see these guys brought about to heel within the California legal system, but I'm not quite sure where to start. Any advice?
