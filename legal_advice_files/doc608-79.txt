Short and simple. Anyways we hired movers to help us move our stuff into Pods and I have all my personal belongings in my suitcase. Yesterday I had just decided to try pot for the first time from my friends wax cart (moving is stressful). Long story short I bought one from him and put it in my suitcase. I had work and just got home and noticed my cart isn't in my suitcase in the spot I put it. I have checked all my clothes spots and luggage to make sure. In conclusion I'm very confident one of the movers (insured) took my wax cart while I was at work.. What do I do? Its medical down here in FL should I contact them? What can I do?  Is it possible that it's legal to carry it for his mom? [deleted] So you want to know if you can report your illegal drugs stolen either to the police or to the insurance? Think about that... [deleted] Was it legal for you to possess that?
