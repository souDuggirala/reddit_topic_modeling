 I understand that I could easily do a Google search but I want to make sure that I'm being thorough. What are the complete context of laws which can be applied and used when addressing internet piracy I am drawing up a contract to hire web designers for my company and want to make sure I'm not held responsible for anything they might design in violation of internet piracy, trademarking, restriction, copyright, and licensing laws I'm hurting web designers cuz I know nothing about web design, otherwise I'd do it myself You're hiring web designers? Okay, let me put this into your language. Imagine that a typical end user's site is running slow so they decide to go in to the server, on their own, and fiddle with settings trying to get it to respond better. That's you writing a contract. If you want a standard contract, you can get boilerplate easily enough via Google. If you want something sophisticated, you hire a professional. The law is tricky, and copyright law even more so. You cannot do this by yourself.  Hire a lawyer. You don't really have a particular clear legal question here.  Hire a lawyer to write your contract. That is the best way to limit your liability as much as possible.
