 I'm watching the President of the United States and pondering his legal standing when I came up with something I honestly really have no idea of how to research so I thought I'd give it a try here. Let's say a President, does not have to be the current one, gets into legal trouble and is removed from office. At their trial they attempt to prove he is mentally incompetent to stand trial. And they are successful at this. My question is, if you could then show that he was never mentally competent as President of the United States, what happens to everything he signed? It's my understanding that that would void contracts, but does the President of the United States operate above those laws? An unfortunate backdoor to abuse someone whose mental capacity has diminished? The Constitution just assumes they would be removed without any other real footnotes that I can find. There are mechanisms in place for it, but what if nobody uses them? Obviously that puts everyone at a cabinet level and above up on some horrible charges, but again...what happens to the laws and judicial appointments?
