 So my dad was backing out from our garage and he accidentally hit a car behind him that he didn't see. It was a minor dent on the driver's side door. However the lady whose car was hit was parked in a fire lane zone. I have video and photo evidence of her parking. She was waiting for something or someone. I told her that her car was small enough to fit in her garage where there were was one car (also have photo evidence) but she laughed and walked off. My dad and the woman exchanged insurance information already as this happened 20 minutes ago. Is there any legal action that could be taken due to the fact that she wasn't supposed to be there in the first place? Any help is much appreciated. Thanks. Probably because your dad hit her, not the other way around. The party that is moving is almost always the one at fault. Thanks so much for the reply. Thing is I forgot to mention this and will make an edit she hesitated moderately to give us her insurance information.  Your dad will assume most if not all fault for the accident. Forward the photos and video to your providers and let them know the lady was parked illegally. Biggest thing is not to talk to their insurance without y'alls involved. Edit: Worse case he is 100% at fault. Other case he isn't found completely at fault or yalls insurance uses the photos and video to settle with their insurance. Either way the insurance rates are going to go up. No this isn't a "avoid responsibility on a technicality" scenario. Which seems to be what you're fishing for, and is generally a shitty fucking approach to life. A driver is always responsible for avoiding fixed objects. I completely understand however does being parked in a fire lane affect anything?  't supposed to be there in the first place? No. A driver is always responsible for avoiding fixed objects.
