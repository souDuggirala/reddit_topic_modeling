 The agreement for on-campus housing, which I live in, reads: "Weapons are prohibited on campus. No Licensee shall possess or discharge any weapon, including firearms (including licensee and guests who possess concealed weapons permits), BB guns, sling shots, pellet guns, airsoft guns, paint guns, ammunition, fireworks, explosives, archery equipment, or any other material or instrument that poses an unreasonable risk of damage or injury, in or around the housing facilities." (Emphasis added) My question is: Can I bring basic archery equipment(not the actual bow)? I want to bring finger guards, arm guards, a quiver, and arrows with points. I'm sure all of it is fine except for the arrows, which I'm not sure about. Would having arrows(with no bow) pose an unreasonable risk of damage? Not sure how relevant it is but the arrows are for recreational use, the points are designed to stick into Styrofoam and hay (they're not broadheads). Create an ornamental display with said arrows and accessories and call it artwork inspired by the heritage of the community involved. Let them try to criticize your artwork. Now go make it and frame it.  Why would you bring the archery equipment without the bow? Why not just leave everything with the bow? I dont think this sub can give you advice because it isnt really a legal issue, it is completely up to your university on what to allow in your dorm.  To what end to you want to have these things on campus? What has the resident coordinator said? I think in California you can get in trouble for even thinking about a weapon...even a big rock.
