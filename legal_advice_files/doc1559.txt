 This happened in Rhode Island though I don’t think it matters. I took liquid cold medicine a couple months ago from an almost empty plastic bottle. I felt something hard in my mouth and promptly spit it into a paper towel. I believe it’s glass, and there are several pieces at the bottom. So, I emailed the company and let them know what I found. They responded my sending me an envelope to send them the product and a coupon for a new bottle. Some notes: the (glass) was found 11/2018, the bottle expired 12/2018, I emailed the company I believe 1/2019. I can post the paperwork if necessary, but I figured I’d just check legaladvice before I sent it out.  That was nice of them to send an envelope.  What's your question?
