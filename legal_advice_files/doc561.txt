 Happened last week bought meds at a pharmacy but i was dispensed the wrong drug and only noticed it when i had to buy another stock for refills. this happened in the Philippines and i was wondering if i could get some just compensation since i was compromised, lost time and money and health and i could have been hospitalized due to the error. need help ty! Yeahhh...no
