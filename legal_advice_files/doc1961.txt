 USA, NC I am worried about part of my new employment contract, which I haven't signed yet. The employer says they won't change it. I don't want to quit the job over this. I've been there for a few months. The most worrying part is: Does this mean that in the future they could force me to come back here to help them in court indefinitely without compensation? Or even just to help from somewhere else, which could still be burdensome?
