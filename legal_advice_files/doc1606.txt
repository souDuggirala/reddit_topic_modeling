 Hi, I have been trying to find answers to this online without a lot of luck thought I'd try here. In 2013, my Mother was killed in a car accident. At that time, my brother was 11 years old. We had hired an attorney to file a wrongful death case toward the company who's truck blew the stop sign and through them, we had the adoption process taken care of for us through our attorney who sought the help of a family law firm. The legal guardianship then went to my younger sister. She was 27 at the time. Fast forward to now. My sister died on November 30th through complications of ESRD. She herself had a 13 year old daughter and of course my now 17 year old brother. She didn't leave a will or anything like it. I think she had a hard time accepting the circumstances of her condition and couldn't bring herself to do it. Her daughter's Father is not in the picture and neither is my brother's. Fortunately, last year I was able to purchase a home for them to live in with my 24 year old sister there to help as well. So everyone is safe and under one roof, but I know now I need to adopt the two kids and take over legal guardianship. I partially live at their home, but I work almost all hours of my life and have a second home which is my main home closer to where I do most of my work so a lot of the responsibility will be in the hands of my sister and she is all for it. I'd like to do this without the help a law firm because it was quite costly and I have lots of other major expenses at this time so saving is ideal. I just don't know where to begin.  Sorry, but you need an attorney. And you need to live there, and cut back on your work, or you aren't going to be approved to adopt.
