 I rented a room in a woman’s house for two months recently. Because I was in a rush to find somewhere to live, and also because I am apparently very naive, I did not sign a lease. Instead, I paid the two month’s rent, plus one month security deposit up front. When I left, she told me (in writing via text), that she would return the security deposit to me electronically within two weeks. The two weeks have passed, and she has now blocked my phone number. Do I have any options here? Thank you so much for any help!
