 I want to self-publish a book that includes some of Trump's tweets (including ones made years ago, before he was president or running for president), along with a bunch of his campaign statements. Are these tweets copyrighted? Or are they in the public domain? I give citations for them (the date, author, and the fact that they're tweets), but I want to know if Trump Co. will come after me for infringing one thing or another. Same goes for various statements he's made at rallies or while campaigning. What are my restrictions for publishing these statements? His statements since his election are very likely not covered by copyright since works of government are generally not copyrightable. Stuff from before he took office is another matter. There are "fair use" exceptions in copyright law related to study and commentary, this is dicey and you probably need to talk to a real lawyer rather than an armchair lawyer wannabe like myself. :) That being said, there are not really "copyright police". In order to get in trouble for this, Trump or his people would have to a) notice that you did it, and b) sue you. You'll have to decide how likely either of these things are.  Before doing anything related to Trump and his org, which are among the most litigious people in the world, you are going to want to meet with an attorney in person.
