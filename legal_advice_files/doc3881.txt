 Too bad you arenâ€™t in the states.  Basically sure, however they can still sue the person who controls the domain if they wanted to which I mean as a former employee a judge might see it as malicious. Also as long as your not holding it for ransom and turning down reasonable offers to sell. Again your talking some very grey areas as ICANN is not very clear on a lot of things and a lot of stuff like this is hard because usually it is international and just not a whole lot of precedence has been set globally. But generally falls into what was the intent, you were a former employee who knew the domain was coming to an end and were trying to take it they will try and prove you just wanted to ransom it back and I think a judge would most likely agree. Doing business in bad faith is always a bad idea. Sure could. I'd recommend using a new account not tied to the old one, though. So I could buy it and just stick a list of AdSense stuff on it and a "this domain is for sale" sign? No its violates ICANN, but if your buying it to use for your own purposes it would be legit. Sure, you'll get sued, lose, and need to pay huge fees amd damages but you can do that.
