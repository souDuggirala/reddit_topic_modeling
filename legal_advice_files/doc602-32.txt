I am truly asking for a friend in NC.  Works in IT dept at a "software as service" company, and said company has customers who need help at all hours.  Every six weeks each person has to be on call and available 24/7, for 7 days straight.  This is in addition to regular work responsibilities that happen during normal office hours.  For this on call duty, person gets an extra $100. I get that it's like being an emergency responder - nothing might happen or all hell might break loose.  But during that time if you're on call, you're expected to check every hour or so to see if a ticket has been submitted. This includes waking up during the night to check.  Legal?  In NC there are no limits to how much an employer can require their employees work (outside of regulated positions like commercial truck driving). No limits on hours or days in a row. 
 
If an employee is salary exempt, they are not eligible for overtime compensation. In NC, the maximum is therefore 24x7= 168, assuming weekly pay periods. 
 
If the employee is non-exempt, they are eligible for overtime for all hours worked over 40 in a defined week.  WOW!!  Thank you for info!! Is she salary exempt, or salary non-exempt (uncommon)? 
 
If she is properly salary exempt, her employer can expect her to be working 168 hours per week, before additional money is required. A $100 ‘on call’ bonus is legal, but not required. 
 
 &gt; She is a full-time employee, not a 1099. Paid a salary. So the on call money is a "bonus."

 [removed] Is the friend an exempt or non-exempt employee?
