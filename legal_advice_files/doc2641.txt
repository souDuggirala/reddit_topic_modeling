 Last week my truck was stolen from my driveway and it was filled with personal tools, according to my insurance agent my comprehensive policy will only pay for $250 worth of personal items inside the vehicle. I want to check if my homeowners policy through Allstate will cover the tool theft but I am afraid if I call and even ask that they will raise my rates whether I file a claim or not. Is there any way to know if they will cover, and for how much, and also how much it will raise my rates? r/insurance  These are all questions to ask your homeowner's policy. They're not likely going to raise your rates just for asking a question.
