 Basically my girlfriend's mom used her vehicle to run errands and ended up totaling the car. Insurance paid off loan and raised gf's rate due to "at fault accident" listed on her driving record. Does this sound right? Reach out to the Tennessee Department of Commerce Insurance, and find out if you have a basis to file a complaint.
