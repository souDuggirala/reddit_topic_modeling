I have worked for an independent insurance agency for the past few months as a 1099 agent.  They did provide some 'non-forgiven' draw, but I did not take much.  They now want me to leave because I am not producing enough, but they want me to pay back $1200 of draw.  I did do unpaid work for them (clerical things) and they will get paid on all the renewals of the policies I wrote while with them (they own the book of business).  Am I legally liable to pay the $1200 back?  I have told them I will service my business until the renewals pay off the draw, but they have already removed all my access to the company. This is in Indiana btw  [removed] Working on a draw and having to pay back if you come in under that draw is generally legal in a lot of places.  It's going to come down to the exact agreement in place for that draw, though.
