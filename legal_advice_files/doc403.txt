 I weld for a union contractor, but occasionally do some unsanctioned side work for cash. Typically these are very small jobs like bars on basement windows or small repairs with the occasional railing repair or replacement. I make it clear to my "clients" that independently, I am unlicensed, unbonded and uninsured, but I stand by my work and have not been concerned about potential liability until now... Our neighborhood swimming pool has reached out to me to repair some railings on the large concrete steps. It is not a hard job at all, but the money will be good and they are eager to give me the work because I'm a neighborhood guy and would be significantly cheaper than a licensed contractor. I explained that I am uninsured etc. and that before we agreed I would need to write up a contract that protects me from any and all potential liability, regardless of how improbable. So, back to my question: how to I write something airtight? Is there a form version I can find online? THANKS! TL;DR I want to do some light construction for the neighborhood pool, am not licensed, bonded or insured but they still want me to do it. I must produce a liability contract. Your state laws will matter a lot. In many states, though, you can be penalized for doing this sort of work without a license insurance, and because we're talking about government penalties you cannot protect yourself by making sure the client is OK with it. If you wanted to do this anyway, and have something so airtight that it could survive a lawsuit, you would need to speak to an attorney. Sorry but according to the rules of this subreddit we cannot help you with your contract. It's worth it to pay a lawyer to get it right, especially where liability is concerned.
