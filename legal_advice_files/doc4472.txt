 I had previously torn my ACL playing for my schools football team in March. In the tearing, I badly sprained my MCL and pretty much ripped my Meniscus. The ACL was reconstructed and the MCL is good. The Meniscus was initially repaired by stitching it together. That eventually broke and causing the meniscus pieces to be pushed out and leaving a hole that caused discomfort during rehab and general activities. I had a meniscus transplant surgery since there was nothing left to shave or repair. During the surgery, my peroneal nerve was damaged by improper stitching of the opening causing my foot to go numb and limp. I was put under again to fix the issue. Now, my foot has not gotten better. My knee is fine but it has been difficult to walk without an AFO splint. Getting my quad to flex and fire has also been difficult. Just wondering if there's some kind of recourse here. Thank you.  As the other commenter said nobody here is going to be able to tell you if you actually have a case or not. That being said, losing the ability to use your foot is not an acceptable side effect of acl surgery. If I were you I would contact a medical malpractice attorney as well as looking for a second opinion on how to fix your issues correctly. Whether or not malpractice is the case here is going to be at the discretion of your attorney  You can consult a medical malpractice attorney. Consults are usually free. Medical malpractice is too complex and fact-dependent for this sub to really be any help. Even if you have a case, it may not be worth the cost of litigation.
