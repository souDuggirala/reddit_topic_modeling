 First off I live in Ohio where reefer isn't totally legal yet. My friend has been so sick and has an intense cough. We also happen to take fat dabs often. He went to the doctor yesterday to get everything checked out and they noticed a film on the inside of his throat forming and they knew instantly he was a smoker. They ended up having to get it flushed and he said it looked a 2g resin ball came up. He was concerned for his safety so admitted to the doctor that he smoked, but while waiting they called the police. Once the police showed up he was actually CHARGED with possession. This is ridiculous, and frankly I don't know if it is legal. ANY advice to get him out of this mess would be great.
