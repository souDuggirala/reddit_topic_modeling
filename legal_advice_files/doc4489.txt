 I had recently asked about TOD and had my question answered but as I was reading more into the subject it states it’s only for properties with 4 units (rental). My mom owns apartments and wants me to get this ready for her. She has three different properties that she owns. One has 4 apartments but the other have 5 and 6, is the TOD fine for those too or is there a different form I have to find? Thank you. Also, she plans on disbursing each property to my brother, sister and me. Does she need a TOD for each property? Is it really that expensive later on? Yikes? She has a will, does that help her at all? I think she was trying to see if there were any easier ways other than probate. The phrase for this is "penny wise, pound foolish." Pay a couple grand now or $50k later bc it's all screwed up. Up to you. Ah, yeah - looks like there's a relatively new law in CA that limits TOD. My guess is that if she passes, the 5+ unit buildings would not be transferred to you and would have to go through probate. That would cost money. So it's really a question of paying a lawyer now or paying one later and incurring a lot of expense. Sorry I updated my post to include state. Ive read three different sites that keep bringing up the 4 unit thing that’s why I want to make sure. And yeah I’ve told her but she doesn’t want to because then she’d have to pay the lawyer. Would the TOD be accepted with errors or would it be caught and rejected allowing us to fix it? I’ll bring it up to her again hopefully she just chooses the lawyer. Edit: [4 units](http://www.edmundvincentlaw.com/blog/complete-guide-to-california-transfer-on-death-deeds) Here it says no more than 4 units. State might matter, but I don't think there's anywhere that the 4-unit rule is a thing. TOD is TOD. But to take a step back: if your mother owns multiple buildings, she has more than enough assets to make it worth doing real estate planning. Get a real lawyer to help you.
