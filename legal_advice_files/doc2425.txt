  I was wondering if its possible to sue facebook for banning me while i was hacked and had no control over it. They wouldn't even look at my IP logins and their facebook support is worse then Sprints Mobiles. This also has happened to many other people too. So would that technically be a cyber breach in their responsibility? PS: 2 hours before my account was fine took a nap and woke up too it being gone and loosing almost 7 and half years of my life gone. According to my mother someone posted a picture of a half naked girl while I was asleep and mind you again I had no control over it. I'm older then you think I am lol Facebook does not have a responsibility to provide service to you. They can choose not to have you as a customer.  No. A young kid with no money has 0 chance to sue the biggest social media company in the world.  What is "a breach in their service"? They're a private company and don't have to provide any service at all. Mark Zuckerberg could delete your account tomorrow because he had a bad dream about you.   No. It's a private service. Other than human rights issues such as race and gender, they have no obligation to provide service in the first place except as established by contract. The terms of service make it pretty clear they can terminate service at their sole discretion at any time. Frankly, it's not as settled as I'd like it to be that they have a legal duty not to ban people on protected class bases, either. I don't understand the question. Facebook can not allow you to use their service if they want to. But it's a breach in their service is it not? You have no case since you have no right to use Facebook in the first place. Facebook is private and can refuse to allow you to use their service if they want to.
