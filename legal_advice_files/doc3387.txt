 My dad and I aren’t on really on speaking terms but i am with the rest of my family and everyone tells me i need him to get my citizenship. I’ve done the google search but it gets overwhelming and the consulate didn’t seem eager to help. Was wondering if i could get citizenship? Thank you! Thank you! If you look at the [document checklist for applying for a Canadian citizenship certificate (PDF)](), you'll need to provide proof of your father's Canadian citizenship, like his birth certificate. The limits on who can get a person's birth certificate depend on which province/territory someone was born in. If your dad was [born in Ontario](), only he can apply for his birth certificate. [Apply for a Canadian citizenship certificate: About the process]() [You may want to read through CIC's info page on the subject](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=365 top=5). (The "you" in this page would be your father, not yourself.) I believe there's a good chance that you're _already_ a Canadian citizen, and that your problem is not applying for citizenship but rather proving your citizenship status.
