 like a goof ball I took a job for the federal government. seemed like a good idea right? the entire hiring and onboarding process was a mess. but i overlooked all the red flags. once i started the job i quickly realized the entire department was a mess and quickly put in my resignation. long story short its been about 60 days and they have never paid me. i was supposed to be paid for training, expenses, per diem etc i have turned in all expense receipts and we kept a paper time sheet in the office. however i get no replies from emails sent. when i call i get the rub around saying they dont have a time sheet or record of some kind. i keep providing them all necessary info. the amount owed to me is around $1,000. do i need to lawyer up and sue for unpaid wages? Defo talk to a lawyer and try and recuperate earnings  []() But I suspect with the shutdown, no one there is working right now.  Then agency HR or OPM.  Actual employee not contractor. what is OPM? Were you an actual federal employee or a contractor? If federal, did you contact OPM or your agencyâ€™s specific HR? If contractor, have you contacted their HR? If yes to contacting then you would follow up with a wage complaint with the department of labor.  fixed
