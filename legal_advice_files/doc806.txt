 We are selling our home and the buyers have made multiple addendums, one being that we need to cover all costs associated with damages from the move. The buyers have been a nightmare so far and if I had to guess, they are going to find any possible imperfection in the existing house and claim that it was due to our movers... Other than taking pictures of the house before and after the move, what else should we do... Should we agree and sign? Or should we reject that addendum. If you are hiring a professional moving company they typically are required to repair any property damage caused by their crew to your home. The claims person for the moving company is pretty used to dealing with new owners of homes or their realtors to get this handled directly.  I sold four homes and never heard that. I personally would not do it. The way they sound, you will end up paying for something. Just take thorough pictures. Here in California, the buyers do a walk through just right before it closes through escrow.  Realistically, it's a rather tooth-less addendum, I'd probably sign it. Assuming they don't get keys until they sign and the deal closes, there's not much they can do at that point except sue you. Which they'd have to do with or without the addendum. Or they can make a claim on their homeowner's insurance or go after the movers. Unless they ask you to actually escrow funds to be held until after they move it, it's silly. Don't agree to escrow funds, if they ask that and certainly don't volunteer it. Definitely take lots of detailed photos, include a newspaper or something with the date as proof. Perhaps even some video.  Aren't you moving out before the sale? They can do a walk-through immediately before closing, no? Pretty desperate... We are pending this sale to get into our next house. How desperate are you to sell?
