 Hi, I sent an email to several local sheriff's offices because I found out someone who was grooming me while I was in school has changed his vehicle and place of employment and didn't update his registry. He is also dating a girl who lives in my neighborhood and spends the night next to a school at her house. I am scared of him, terrified of him finding out it was me. I used a vpn. Will the vpn keep the report from going through? I asked the cops to keep me anonymous if they learned my name (vpns can only do so much), but will they still tell him who contacted them? I am so scared, but I'm tired of being scared of him.  This man broke the law (in quite a few states having a 17 year old girlfriend is indecent behavior with a juvenile) and served his punishment for it. For some reason he is subject to some additional requirements that a convicted murderer is not. People like you - anonymous snitches - were the ideal citizen in East Germany or the Soviet Union. You know, the evil empire. You're worrying too much. You reported what you felt was necessary, and now it's out of your hands. Law enforcement will decide what action if any is appropriate.  This is not an official answer as I am not a cop or lawyer, but I really don’t think they would have any reason or obligation to tell this man why they’re checking up on him or who gave them the tip.
