 Hello all. I'm in Tennessee and we sold a pair of beds to a lady and she came and paid 180 of 200(owes 20) and only got the headboards that day. It's been 2wks and she still hasn't came to get them, and we've texted her several times. I tried to find the law on this and got confused. .basically I need to know what we can do legally bc they're in the way now. Thanks for reading. [removed] It was for whole sets, including bedspreads.  Eat the $20. Follow abandoned property guidelines. Give her 30 days from day of initial pick-up to grab the rest. If she don't, resell what is left. Maybe she only wanted the headboards? For 200 bucks maybe OP gave her a low price so she would remove the beds but the lady just wanted the headboards and got a good deal on them. So now she's ghosting. I admit this isn't legal advice but rather common sense advice. It's been two weeks and she has made no effort to get the beds. You could document your text's to her or whatever but at this point you are not morally in the wrong by getting rid of the beds another way. I mean at this point what else are you going to do??? Think about it you have no real options here. She payed you but left the stuff she payed you for... after too long it becomes yours again IMO. Try calling the police department and ask them what you can do with the stuff. I bet they will tell you to do whatever with it. Tell her to pick them up by ____ or you’re reselling them. If you don’t want to do that say she has____ days to pick them up and then you’re setting them outside. I doubt any legal issues would even come into play for such a small thing. She’s just being inconsiderate  Do you have some actual state law description that supports this? No offense but your statement is the obvious answer but we don't want her to have a legal leg to stand on if we do have to sell them again.  She payed cash? Tell her she will lose the beds if she doesn't get them immediately then just resell them if she doesn't show.
