 [CA] Is it legal for a customer to take sneakily take a photo of me if they are upset ? I told my manager about it but they said not to worry about it . But the last time this happened a customer followed our coworker all the way to their house.  Tried that and she refused to send them away ...shady tactics on her end I guess  Yes. They could even take a very obvious photo of you. Your recourse would be for the business to trespass this customer off the property.
