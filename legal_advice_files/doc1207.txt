 Hi, So I have a mandatory work meeting coming up on Thursday. I was told it was going to be regarding the part times employees (myself included) and that they’re going to cut our hours and have the freedom to transfer us to different sites as needed. I work at a preschool. In order for such a change to occur, I would imagine I’ll be presented with a new contract, considering that my current one is valid until July and states when and where I’ll be working (one location, set hours and days). I don’t agree with these changes, and wish to carry out my current contract. Can I be fired for neglecting to sign a contract I disagree with? And if I do get fired for that reason, is there any action I can take? If your current contract actually lists a term length and says how many hours you'll get each week and doesn't have any language that allows it to be canceled or modified before that date - you've got a chance, at least, of forcing them to stick to the terms of the original agreement. If they present you with a new contract... don't sign it yet. Politely let them know you want to look it over with your lawyer... then take both contracts to someone who does employment law right away. They'll examine the old contract to see if your employer has an easy out, or if they think it's enforceable.  Look at your existing contract if you actually have one and see what it says about changes.  Do you have an actual contract or a job offer? Are you sure you are actually a contract employee, and not at-will with a set schedule / location? If you truly are contracted to a fixed location then the language of the contract will determine each of your rights.
