 So my friend was at a red light and she was hit from behind and then another car hit the car behind her which caused her car to jerk twice. Well she was sending a friend a video on Marco Polo application. It was hands free and not holding or touching the phone. But the video is proof that she was hit twice as opposed to once. I'm just curious if it's ok if she was taking that video so she doesn't get in trouble if that video is brought up in court. Insurance covers it, so why would it go to court?  Could be used against her as distracted driving as it was not a "dash cam". Only bring in if she really needs it.  'm just curious if it's ok if she was taking that video so she doesn't get in trouble if that video is brought up in court. That will depend on her local "hands free" driving laws.
