 I loaned $500 to a friend last December via Venmo, under the condition that he sign a written loan agreement. He signed it and everything, and included a copy of his Texas driver's license Social Security card on the loan agreement. Based on the terms of the agreement, he now owes $600 to me, but he hasn't responded to any of my messages or phone calls. What I'm concerned about is my ability to take him to small claims court because the loan was done through Venmo, and he and I live in 2 different counties (I'm in Tarrant County, he's in Jackson County 300 miles away). If I were to take him to small claims court, would I have to file in Tarrant County or Jackson County? Would I be able to take him to small claims court despite the loan being conducted via Venmo and him and I being in 2 different counties? All of this occurred in Texas. I appreciate any assistance or advice you can provide regarding this matter. Thank you. That's probably what I'm going to do after speaking to legal counsel. I was hoping to resolve this matter without going to small claims, but the guy's basically ghosted me and I feel like a total idiot. forget about the interest and just ask for the 500 bucks. The loan was taken out December 6th, 2018, and it was supposed to be paid back for the full amount on December 12th, with a $100 penalty (20%) if still unpaid by December 31st 2018. Nuts. I didn't know about usury law, but I will speak to legal aid prior to doing anything. Still 2x-3x the usury limit. It sounds like he means December 2017 in which case, his fees would be on par with a 20% to 30% interest rate. Not insane. To be clear, the loan was taken out in December 2018 and was due this month, correct? I'm concerned [because you likely violated Texas's criminal usury statute if that's the case]() by charging an interest rate that was eons past the allowable rate. You may want to speak to someone before moving forward.
