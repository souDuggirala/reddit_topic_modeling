 I am confused, is dating someone underage (under 18) and you are legal age (18 and over), (like a 14 year old dating a 20 year old or a 15 year old dating a 19 year old?) Is that illegal or not? Basically, very bad at conversations Is that all you say? Ok Lmao like 2 or 3 posts  Stop commenting on basically all my posts Pretty sure thatâ€™s illegal, but if not really weird  Ok thanks I didn't know that Oh ok, thank you for saying that Well, that might be true. But the adult is still at risk of a charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, or whatever the forum state calls it. Being friends someone isn't illegal at any age. "Dating" is not a legally defined term. While there are issues of contributing to delinquency its not illegal to "date" a minor so long as there is no sexual activity. Depending on the state and the relationship of the individuals (like a teacher and student) sex may or may not be legal. That's generally the case in a really simplified sense but there may be other laws that cover "grooming" the child that may make some common behaviors associated with dating illegal on the adult's part. Ah ok, its just I had this discussion with my mom and I was just basically confused because she said if they don't have sex that it's not illegal It depends on state law.
