 My fiance of 14 years left me almost a month ago for another man whom she works with. As of Monday she will have been out of the house for a month although she still has some of her possessions at the house. The house deed is under only my name although we had a joint bank account and the mortgage was paid from both of our paychecks. I'm curious how long she has to have vacated the premises before I'm legally clear to get rid of her stuff. Although this is not my intention, I would like to know what my legal rights are. I live in Florida. Do I need to evict her? I've been pressuring her to get the rest of her stuff out of the house and she's not taking me seriously or is dragging her feet. Is there a set time limit she has to have been out of the house before I'm in the clear or before I can legally change the locks? Obviously I cannot force her to move her stuff out or to change her mailing address but the sooner she is out of my house the better I will be. Thank you in advance for the help.   Since she is a legal tenant there, you will indeed have to formally evict her in order to remove the rest of her belongings.
