 Hello, not a real life, happening right now situation, and there is every chance my parents don't get divorced, but on the off-chance their dysfunction manifests into something concrete like a divorce how will my parents (or at least my biological dad, but probably both him and my step-dad, it depends on a variety of factors that will basically just be explaining the specific dysfunction that belongs to another subreddit) be affected by them signing off on any student loans I have plus those my older sister has while splitting assets? Thanks in advance and if this is the wrong sub please let me know. I honestly don't know what to flair this as.
