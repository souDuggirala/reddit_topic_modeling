 Hey guys, First time poster to this subreddit but I wanted to check in regarding a defamation email I received recently. Basically, My partner bought me an artwork. The artist in question then aligned himself with a band that have been known to be racist and commit violence against women. My partner spoke out about this on a post he had put out saying he would be doing work for them. She had said something along the lines of 'I don't want to support abusers or anyone that aligns themselves with abusers'. The comments were deleted from the post and we were contacted personally saying that our posts have damaged his business and given him emotional mental distress. An instagram post had come up from a gallery showing the artists work. The same thing happened, except this time it was just my partner commenting. She posted once. We received an email saying that we need to delete the comment, stop commenting all together, and that a lawyer will be in contact with us shortly. He mentioned that we have caused emotional distress and loss of business (from comments he had deleted within minutes of us posting. 3 or 4 in total which was back and forth with the artist.) and the recent comment which is now down (only up for a day or two). The artist then said we bullied him and that he feels attacked. My question is, does he still have legal standing after everything has been taken down? He mentioned he can and will sue us if it continued but then goes on to say that his lawyer will be in contact with us. I haven't replied yet as I wasn't exactly sure what to do, apart from deleting the post in question.
