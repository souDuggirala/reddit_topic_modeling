 In 2017 I was involved in a car accident in PA and it was determined that I was not at fault. I was with State farm at the time of the car accident. The damage to the back end of the car was substantial and I didn't know this till now but it had also sustained structural damage as well. Shortly after that I had the vehicle towed to a manufacturer affiliated repair shop near the site of the accident in PA . Their original estimate on the car was $14,000 in damage. The dealership told me the vehicle was NOT a total loss. I asked the repair shop if they would consider the car a total loss cause I didn't want to have a car in a not so favorable condition no matter how good it looked $14,000 later. I was told because the repairs were less than how much I still owed on the car my options were either to have the repair shop fix the car or be without car and no payout. So I would still be making monthly payments on a car that was undrivable. Thus I requested that the guilty party pay my deductable and for the repair shop to start the repairs. A short time later the repair shop requested another $5,000. Which was still not more than I owed, but yeah. Fast forward nearly a year later... I'm now trying to sell the vehicle but when pulling the car fax I find out that the vehicle was declared a total loss, something I was was never aware of when authorizing the repairs. Do I have any recourse here? Thanks for the advice. NAL but it looks like there are specific things that have to happen in PA for a total or partial loss claim. [link]()
