 I loaned a friend $6.00. They said they'd pay me back that Friday. Well several Fridays came and went and they didn't give me back my $6.00. When I asked about it, they gave me $2.50 and said they'd give me the rest later. Later hasn't came yet. Can I sue them for the $3.50? Sure you can. You're wasting your time if you do though.  Court costs are generally recoverable in addition to the claimed amount.  $3.50? Yes, but it would be a waste of time. Sheesh. You can. There's no minimum to sue in small claims. You will have to pay a filing fee, which is likely more than the $3.50 you're looking to recover. For further reference: [Indiana Small Claims Manual]() Troll  It costs money to file a claim in small claims court.  The court costs alone would make it not worth it.
