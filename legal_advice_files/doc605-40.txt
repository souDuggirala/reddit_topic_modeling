I recently sent a spoofed email to some teachers from another school saying a few things about a few of the students which are friends of mine. The email was sent from the email of another kid I know. The friends didnt take it as a joke and will probably be called down to the office tomorrow. I sent a follow up saying that it was all a big mix up. I was just wondering how much trouble they could get in for my false claim of "cyberbullying" which I know isnt a big deal. And how much trouble I could get in for the spoofed email. I'm in Pennsylvania, USA. This isn't a legal issue.

The school can punish you as they deem fit.
