 This takes place in a high school in New Jersey, if it makes a difference. Our school’s National Honor Society (NHS) program is requiring of each member to pay $3 towards a fundraiser, we receive “demerits”. I’ve heard from alumni this is not an isolated incident and that even things like prom are far more expensive for NHS members. As this is not a program just within our school (I believe the NHS is a national organization), does the school have jurisdiction to threaten or revoke my membership if I don’t pay money?
