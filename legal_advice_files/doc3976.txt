 Completely fine. Did it all the time in DMV. OP- If you're charging for your time, your students probably ought to be required to purchase copies of the book for themselves. Yes, that would be fine. You can't make photocopies and it would probably be best if your "students" bought a copy so they could do the practice problems and tests.
