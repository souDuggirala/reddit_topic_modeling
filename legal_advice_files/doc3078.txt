 My ex boyfriend has not stopped calling, texting, sending letters, coming to my house, and following me in his car for the past 9 months, despite me telling him I don’t want contact. It’s about once a week, and he is not threatening or dangerous in any way. It’s just annoying and upsets my kids when he shows up. I’m not scared of him, I just want him to stop. However, he’s a teacher, and I wouldn’t want to cause any trouble for him if something shows up on a background check. He has a disabled son who depends on him having a job.  Any restraining order, peace order or no contact order will generally show up on background checks for as long as they are in effect.
