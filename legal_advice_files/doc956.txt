 Brief description of the preludes that lead up to the event. Snow storm came through and had lots of ice. Landlord's hired snow removal guy came over early in the morning and took care of snow issues. Later in the afternoon, roommate was walking to class (2pm) and rolled ankle on huge patch of ice in the driveway that was failed to be treated by hired man. Went in to nearest hospital and ended up having a broken fibula. This has lead to extensive medical bills and loss of being able to work (uses to pay for rent). He is not a Reddit user and is wondering what his options might be to take action against landlord. NAL but attended condo board meetings. When I attended board meetings at our condo complex, we would payout to slip injuries via our insurance but also we would hold the plow company contracted with us liable also. Try to find out if you landlord has a contract with a company and go after that company and if not go after the landlord. You send a demand letter for hospital bills to be paid and contact a reputable personal injury lawyer. Also look over the lease and see if there is anything about snow/ice removal for the sake of it.
