This chick I had sex with a few times over a year ago came at me with a knife yesterday while I was at a friends. we never had a courtship, just sex. Am I able to charge her with domestic violence?
What constitutes a dating relationship in a domestic violence case? File a police report for the assault and let them figure out how to code it.  While I am not a lawyer, I am certain that counts as assault with a deadly weapon.
