 So a few months back i pawned off an xbox one and an apple watch at my local pawn shop. Fast forward to now and I've been able to come up with the money to recover my items. My question is my items are due to be put up for sale in 5 days unless i pay my loan, in the agreement i signed it said the shop must send me a notice no later than 10 days before the property is to be sold. I haven't received that notice. Am I due to receive my items back or compensation from the shop since I never received the notice. Really dude, go away if all you’re going to give is bs answers  Death  : A pawnbroker may sell any article pawned after the expiration of sixty (60) days from the maturity of the loan, provided that, not less than ten (10) days before making the sale, the pawnbroker shall have given notice to the person by whom the article was pawned, by mail addressed to the post office address of such person as shown on the pawnbroker's register, notifying such person that, unless he redeems the article within ten (10) days from the date of mailing said notice, the article will be sold. THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE PENALTY FOR THIS  [removed] Call them up and ask Typo- meant to say I haven’t been able to come up with the money  Why can't you just try to go in and pay off the loan to get your items back?
