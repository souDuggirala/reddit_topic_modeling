 I was wondering if it is legal to bug someone's house. For context, my Uncle lives with my elderly Grandfather (92) and recently, my Uncle threatened to kill my dad while he was in a rage. My pop-pop was in the room, and he was screaming and cursing at him and slamming his hands on the table. My Uncle is a big guy, over six feet and clearly unstable. My family is concerned about what goes on in the house when no one is around, though we don't think there is physical abuse at this point because my pop-pop is frail so it'd be easy to tell. My pop-pop owns the house so in order to plant a recording device would we only need his consent? or the consent of everyone who lives in the house, even if their names aren't on the mortgage? Or is it plain and simple illegal to bug someone's house? We are working on changing the living situation currently.  I don't know about PA, but some two-party-consent states have exceptions related to crimes. You won't be able to use any conversation recorded in a 2 party state. You can call Adult Protective Services now and see if they can help your grandfather immediately. Pennsylvania is a "two party consent" state. Everyone in the conversation has to consent to the recording or it's illegal wiretapping
