 We are selling our home in Michigan. The buyers missed their due diligence/ inspection period. We now have claims to complete the deal as the contract states or they lose earnest money. Now they are asking us to sign an appraisal contingency. My question is – how is the appraisal contingency different than the financing contingency? If appraisal goes low, under the mortgage contingency, can they walk away and keep their earnest money? Or because they were actually able to get mortgage in the first place and they don’t have an appraisal contingency, is this just a sneaky way to get earnest money back and get out of the deal? The relationship of these questions to your particularly contract to sell is something to review with an attorney. Whether or not you have an obligation to sign such a contingency or why they're asking for it now, apparently already under contract to purchase, is something to review with your attorney.
