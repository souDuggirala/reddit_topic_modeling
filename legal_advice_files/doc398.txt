 When I was a baby my dad committed suicide. At the time my parents weren't living together anymore due to him being abusive. When this terrible incident happened I was told within days that my dad's side of the family went into his place and packed everything up and brought it to a family owned hotel into the basement and locked it away. Several members of my dads family made up fake receipts and said the items were sold. Since there wasn't a will my dad's father named himself the executor. him and his whole family blamed my mom for my dad's death and in retaliation they made sure we had nothing. My mother has some paperwork from lawyers when she tried to fight.. but at 22 years old and suffering from the loss of my dad it was just to much for her. There was no trust set aside for me. My grandfather is now on his death bed and my aunt keeps telling me she wants to get me some money from the estate but has to clear it with her brothers and sisters first. What I want to know is how can I fight this injustice? Can I even do anything? I want to consult a lawyer but I'm not sure how to go about it. Can I contest his will once he passes? I am located in Ontario.  Not sure what nal means.. but i was robbed of my trust. As an executor isn't it his responsibility that something be left for his next of kin? Instead of pretending to sell all his stuff.. and claiming all the money went to the funeral. All the stuff is distributed to family members in their houses.. my grandparents have the living room and kitchen suite. My uncle's got his tools.. my aunt's got his toys (he built and flew model aeroplane's) I was given nothing. I feel like I deserve a piece of his estate when he passes now because he stole what belonged to me.. which was supposed to be put away in a trust. Hire a lawyer.  NAL, but not sure what it is you want to fight as an injustice?
