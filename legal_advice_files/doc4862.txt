 About an hour ago I went to check on my moped before driving to Portland for the holiday and it was gone. I called the police immediately and I am waiting to make a report. The moped was in what was supposed to be a secure room with a camera. There is no onsite manager at my apartment complex, and I am having a really hard time getting ahold of anybody for the camera footage. I am mostly wondering what to do next.. is this something I can report to renters insurance? Is there a better way to get the camera footage? I feel so violated and I really need help on what to do next. Thank you in advance for any help.  You'd have to ask your insurance whether they'd entertain a claim for something stolen from a location that isn't in your unit. There's no need for you to track down the security camera feed. The police will do that. Unfortunately you were the victim of a crime. Hopefully it has a positive outcome, but be forewarned that not all crimes are solved. Do you have insurance?
