 Every first of the month I go and pay all of my bills. My mortgage, utilities all that. Like clockwork. I'm never late. Recently I noticed that Comcast was charging me late fees. I looked it up and it was every month so I contacted them. They said it was based on the date when the product was installed and I get that, but I asked if they could move it up so that I could pay it when the other bills are paid and they said they couldn't. What the hell is the point of that? Just to make a few dollars off me every month? I'm two years in now so I can't just catch up to make a double payment in one month. Any advice on this situation? I don't know if this could be hurting my credit having past dues every month or whatever. Why is it not just easy to just say "Sure! We'll split the balance and charge you the difference and move the date to the 1st"? I just pay every other paycheck and over time I’ve built up about a $200 credit so I’m never late. I have Comcast also Pay 2 months, then the next time you pay you won't be late. This is on you, not them.  Try again to get your bill date changed. That was a minor (though still annoying) problem for me as well, but they DID shift the billing date when I asked. It's possible that the rep you spoke to didn't know how, didn't know they could, or wasn't authorized for such an action. But I think, based on the fact that I got my billing date shifted to something more convenient, that it IS possible if the rep you speak to will do it.
