 Would his father (my ex-husband) be in charge of the money until he becomes an adult? Is there a better way to do this which would allow me to direct the use of the money specifically to my child's education, etc? You need to see an attorney and have a trust created, otherwise the money will not go to a minor, and the courts will have to decide who/how money should be handled....and that may mean the ex controls it. You want to set up a trust. If you have a close family member that you trust, you can have them be the trustee. You could also pick a lawyer to do it - less chance of shenanigans, but they'd be likely to subtract legal fees for the work they do, so it's not a cost-effective solution unless we're talking about a lot of money. An insurance company will typically appoint a trustee to look over the money if a minor is designated a beneficiary. Unless your goal is to drop a lot of money into an 18 year old's lap with zero control or restraints over how that money is spent, the smart move is to create a trust, name the trust the beneficiary, and pick who you want to run the trust.
