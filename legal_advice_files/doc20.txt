 About 3 months ago, someone obtained and used my credit card info to make about $1200 of purchases before I caught it and reported it to my bank. Recently, I received a mailer from one of the merchants involved -- where the merchant had unknowingly sent the mailer to the address associated with my card (my home address), but inside it contained the name and mailing address of the individual who made the fraudulent purchase. I have verified that this person does, in fact, exist, and county records show them residing at the listed address. Am I able to pursue legal action, here? I contacted my bank, who didn't want anything to do with this, and referred me to my local law enforcement. Should I contact a private attorney, the credit bureaus, or law enforcement in the county of the offender? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks! The address might just someone the thief knew would be not home for long enough to grab packages. You don't prosecute. You inform the police, they assign charges and the court enforces them. You should inform the police, and give them all the details. If the bank reversed the charges then you are not the victim the bank and/or the store are the victim. You can let the merchant and bank know about it. Ok, so can I prosecute the mule? Or sue them for damages?  In many instances, the person who uses the credit info to make the purchases uses a "mule" to handle receiving the packages and forwarding them. That "mule" is very likely the name you have. I think they have to be in the same city you live in to press charges with your local law enforcement. You can submit this to the 3 credit report agencies and dispute these charges due to the fraud. I dont think you calling their local police department will do much, but it cant hurt to try. However, that being said, you can still file a police report for the fraud.
