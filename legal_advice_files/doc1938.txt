 Hey all, My partner was the sole employee of a Domestic Profit Corporation in Colorado and was in charge of sales. They believed in it so much that she and her father invested over $10,000 in exchange for 10% equity. There were soon issues at the company. I'll be vague, but her boss was in charge of production and soon there was nothing left to sell. There were also issues in the workplace, for instance: one time she came as normally scheduled in to find him totally naked. She also believed he was having sex with a woman that was not his wife at their place of work. Eventually, she became dissatisfied that her only source of income (commission on sales) was gone because there was no product. He became indignant and, one month later, dissolved the business without paying her a dime. Several months prior, however, he had registered a new company at the same address with an almost identical name. Everything under the new name now redirects to the original website and social media. Does she have any recourse? You can speak with an attorney about the prospects of suing for a portion of the value of assets taken out of the company.  There were assets, including IP that went on to become the backbone of the new company. He claims there was 24K in debt and unpaid wages to himself to the tune of an additional 16K. None of this was documented or provided.  Did the old company have any assets? If the boss took assets from the company, he may owe his investors a portion.
