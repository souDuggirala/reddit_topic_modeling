 A little over a month ago I received a ticket for a minor moving violation. it’s taken longer than expected to get enough extra cash to pay it (only $120 but I’m a broke college student), and it’s gone past the original due date to pay the fine. I revived a notice that an additional $50 was added to the ticket fine for ‘bail’ or something of the like. My question: is it possible to get that extra fee removed If I just call the traffic court and explain i only have the money for the original ticket, or does that decision require me to actually go in front of the judge? Any advice is helpful-thanks!
