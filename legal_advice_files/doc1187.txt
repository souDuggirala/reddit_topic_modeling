 So a couple of days ago I have to at will tenant a verbal notice and then a written notice that she needs to leave in the next thirty days ect. She has now got a lawyer to kick me out of my apartment complex what do I do? Is she just crazy can she do that. SOS Eh, ignore her. Unless you actually violated the lease.  She is moving out I gave the notice to her ! Only issue is she keeps saying sheâ€™s going to get me kicked out of the complex bc she is spiteful  She cannot evict you if you are the actual tenant and she is leasing from you. Which, it sounds like she is. If she actually has a lawyer, then you will probably want to get one to deal with it. If she refuses to move out, you will have to take her to court to get her out.  That sounds like you are her landlord then. If so, you can give her notice to terminate her tenancy with proper notice. I have no idea how she thinks she can get your tenancy terminated, unless you're in violation of your lease.  Not her landlord but I am the only on on the actual lease with the complex I was being nice and renting her a room, I told her if everything worked out (which it did not) we could get her out on the actual lease  No lease, it is a verbal month to month agreement. We had spoken at one point if things worked out ( which the did not ) we could put her on the lease.  Are you her landlord? So, to be clear, there is no lease?
