 Over a year ago, somebody I know sold me a few hundred dollars of product. I won't say what it was as I feel it doesn't matter here, It is nothing bad or illegal in any way. I was surprised the contact was able to acquire such products however I was in no position to question his sale, as I was benefiting from the transaction. I fast forward a little while and I find out that they were stolen and who they were stolen from. I obviously had (and hae) no intention of returning a product I rightfully paid for and had no actual direct influence in stealing Fast forward further to today and we have some arguments happening over new year's. They are threatening to bring back that old news (as I still have the product indeed) and have me arrested or even if it's not that bad they would still make the police return the product. I of course have no interest in losing an expensive product for something I didn't do. I strongly feel I have done nothing wrong personally and was simply involved so another party could gain and now they are trying to take advantage again. Can I do anything against this? Or do I have no right in this due to currently possessing a stolen product (despite it happening over a year ago)? There IS chat history including the rather rude discussion where I found out the product was stolen, so I can show I didn't know, and that I'm not the actual person who stole it. As I said, even if police are not involved whatsoever, it would still be a rather big blow if the item(s) had to be returned. Thanks all If the deal is too good to be true, it probably is.  Despite not having knowledge of the fact that it was stolen? Receiving stolen property is a crime in most states. In CA, if the value of the stolen property is over $950, it can be charged as a felony.
