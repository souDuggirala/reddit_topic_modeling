 Posted yesterday about having trouble tracking down payment on a small claims judgement. I called a local PI and asked if their location services were able to be written off as legal fees and added to the debtors total bill, I was told that many times in his experience yes, especially if I have proof of him being unresponsive and uncooperative, which I definitely do. Just wondering if anyone's experience is similar? The location services are only like a hundred dollars more than process serving, which is the other option for filing a debtors exam, but knowing his employer to file garnishment is the easier option.
