 Hello! I am just asking this question because Im interested to see if my school is doing something wrong. Due to vandalism and vaping in my school, the administration bolted open the door to the boys bathroom. There is a small door blocking view to any urinals, but if you looked hard enough you could probably see someone using a urinal through the mirror. The girls bathroom is not bolted open (I am a girl). Just wanted to know if my school is legally allowed to do this. I find it to be an extreme invasion of privacy and many boys in my school are really pissed off about this.
