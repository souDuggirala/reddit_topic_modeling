 Can someone who has a felony warrant simply move to Canada and live a free life? If not where would a person go to escape the backwards legal system of the USA? As most people know being involved in the United States Justice system can have a revolving door effect. I am not asking this because I am a fugitive I am simply wondering if there is a better place to reside for a person who has expierence with this revolving door effect and the tough punnishment the US inflict's on its own citizens for petty harmless "crimes". Canada has an extradition treaty with the USA, so it's possible this individual would be extradited back to face the charges. If this individual wants to exit the USA and not be at risk of extradition back to the USA, they would need to choose a country that does not have an extradition treaty with the USA. The selection of countries that meet this criteria might be somewhat limiting. Here's the ones that do: []() The type of crime that a country might extradite for, or that the USA would seek extradition for, may be a factor -- generally, this includes and might be somewhat limited to violent crimes. Good luck to them for getting into Canada (unless they do that illegally, too). They're pretty picky about letting in felons.
