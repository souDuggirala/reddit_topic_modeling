Three weeks ago my roommate and I wanted to renew our leases (individual leases) for our apartment. I emailed my complex asking to renew my lease for next year. They replied telling me to call them to verbally request it. I told this to my roommate so he just called and didn't email them, he was told the cost of rent and that they will send him the lease. I called right after he finished. On the phone they told me the price of the rent for the following year and that I was all set, I asked if there was anything else to do and they told me they will send me the lease.

My roommate got a call from them a few days ago telling him to sign it and so he did and he got the price that we were both told at the same time. I didn't know he had already received his lease so I kept waiting until he told me yesterday he already signed it. I called today asking them what happened and they say they have no proof of me asking for the renewal and that the rates have already gone up $15 a month.

Is there anything I can do to get the rate that I was told from the beginning since they are the ones that messed up by not sending me the lease when I first asked for it.  I have proof of the email I first sent and the time of my call just 2 hours after they replied to my email.  Then that's the new rent.  What they told you verbally earlier likely doesn't matter; what you sign and agree to is what matters.

You're free to negotiate with them.  They're free to refuse to negotiate. They just sent it to me now but it shows the $15 increase so I havent signed it.

 Did you or did you not sign a new lease?

What is the amount of monthly rent specified in that new lease?
