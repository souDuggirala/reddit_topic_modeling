 Bad divorce experience here. I am forced to file motion after motion to gain cooperation from my exs attorney. They are asking for things that are incredibly tedious and my ex should be able to produce. I am going to produce it so they don't file more motions against myself, but my question is does my paperwork have to be in order or can I supply the paperwork messy and out of order? I know its petty but will make me feel slightly better. I just spent 7 hours printing emails and text messages and want to let the attorney put it all in order. This guy has been a real jerk btw. I have 497 pages of documents and Ill post my satisfaction in r/pettyrevenge after No one here is going to help you abuse legal process for spite.  Lol ask your attorney to do it and they will put you right in your place. You're essentially asking him to shit on his reputation which won't happen. There isn't going to be any satisfaction because court is not a game and this is not happening.  Ask your own attorney. Pissing off a lawyer is rarely wise. Trying to piss one off in a court process can get you put in contempt.
