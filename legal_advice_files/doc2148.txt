 Back in July, I left my wife of two years due to emotional abuse and communication issues. I won't get into it too much, but I discuss much of it [here.]() Since then, I had been sleeping on my friend's couch until I could get a place. I recently managed to do so, and when I tried to arrange a time to get my cat, my ex said she's keeping him. There are a few things worth mentioning here. 1. I got my cat before we were even in a relationship. There are two others that we got together, and I'm not even fighting for those. Although I should, because: 2. I have screenshots of her admitting to me via text saying that she hurt one of the cats intentionally several times. This was upsetting to me, and I wanted to report her. I should have, but I was afraid of losing my cat as well. I was there to make sure the behavior stopped, but now that I'm not I worry it will begin again. 3. I have a document from my former therapist that the cat was an Emotional Support Animal, or ESA. This letter has since expired, although I planned on getting a new one. 4. He does not get along with one of the other cats very well; the other, he adores. I'm kind of at a loss. I was thinking of calling the police, but I don't know that they can really do anything. An attorney can be expensive, and since our divorce is considered a "simple divorce" in this state (no kids, shared assets), I wasn't planning to hire one. But now I'm thinking that might not be a bad idea? I want to get him out of there as soon as possible. What should I do? [removed] This is what I was attempting to say, but with a little bit more tact. His ex isn’t well grounded. She’s a fucking lunatic NAL But I did read your linked post and based on that, I'd recommend seeing into a lawyer. Your soon-to-be ex does not sound like the most well-grounded person at the moment and it sounds like your care deeply for your cat. Good luck!
