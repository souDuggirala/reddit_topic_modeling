 I booked a table of 5 and they asked me to pay £50 deposit as it’s Xmas yadda yadda and that it would be redeemable on the bill. I then changed the booking to 8 people and paid £80. The extra 3 people then dropped out so I let the restaurant know (this all happened in one day - yesterday). They told me today I can only redeem £50 and tough shit about the extra £30 - I’ll have to get it from the family members who dropped out. There is NOTHING on their website about this rule of only being able to redeem £10 per person against the bill. I have paid £80 on my debit card and I want £80 off my total bill. Can they enforce this rule if it isn’t in their t cs?  You have let people down though. They might not be able to recoup that cost. Do you understand what a deposit is? Also wrong sub Not at all. But 5 of us are showing up so what’s wrong with me wanting my £80 off the bill? I communicated with the restaurant that people had dropped out - I didn’t have to do that and could’ve taken a table for 8 when we have 5. I don’t let companies down and I don’t think they should penalise me as it’s days before the booking? If none of you showed up, would you have expected the full 80 back? /r/legaladviceUK
