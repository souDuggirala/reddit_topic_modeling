 If someone wanted to use the Fyre name to put on a festival, could they do it? Do criminals retain the trademarks associated with their criminal enterprises?  [William Needham Finley IV]() bought it. The balding guy from the documentaries. He said he wants to do his own Fyre Fest. Ironically, it doesn't look like he has any experience putting on festivals.  gotcha. if Billy did own it, would sueing me from prison count as "conducting business" It's a [live trademark](http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc state=4805:dvgt0.2.11), so you'd have a hard time doing so, yes. Though it doesn't look like McFarland owns it - the guy who sued him from the documentary does (very interesting conspiracy theories going on in r/fyrefestival). No, it is still trademarked. Someone bought the trademark in the aftermath of the avalanche of lawsuits.
