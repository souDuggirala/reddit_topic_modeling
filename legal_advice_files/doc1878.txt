 (LA) A group of us started a youtube channel for privacy I wont say what channel it is. So we started a Skateboard stunt channel on youtube and we gained 200k subs in 2 years now we got our youtube partnership we had to wait months to be approved but now we are all fighting for a fair share of the profits the person who setup the channel wont give us any of the money he is only giving it to his brother and closes friend and shunning the rest of us out all in all there are 8 of us involved the channel was setup in his name but the channel is named after the group.  Do you have an agreement that he would pay you royalties? Did you agree to be filmed originally? If he is the one that filmed it by law he is the owner of those videos and without an agreement he legally doesn't have to pay you anything if it wasn't agreed on at first.
