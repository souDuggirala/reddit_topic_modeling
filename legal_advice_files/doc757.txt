 I was in a band with three other people, but we broke up a little while back because of personal and creative differences. while we were together, we recorded, mixed, and mastered a few tracks at a professional studio, for which our guitarist paid on behalf of all of us as a group, since he was the one most able to at the time, and he never asked any of us to pay him back a portion. these songs were composed collaboratively (basically each member composed the part for their own instrument), but all the lyrics were written by the guitarist. I was thinking of making my own Bandcamp page, and wondering if I would be allowed to post the recordings we had made there as a record of my past work. do I need permission from the other three members to do so? do I only need permission if I intend to monetize songs? I believe Bandcamp allows buyers the option to pay more than the artist asks; if I make them available for free, but someone decides to pay anyway, do I have a financial obligation to the other members? if so, would the money just be split evenly four ways, or would the guitarist get a larger cut for the lyrics? what if the song is an instrumental? I would appreciate any and all advice in relation to these questions, or other issues that might arise from this situation. we were based in Chicago, IL, which is where we made the recordings, if that makes any difference.
