 Hello, My ex and I lost our virginities to each other when we were both 15. We had sex a few times during the period where she was 16 and I was 15 (my ex is 7-8 months older than me), and the age of consent in Singapore is 16 years old. I'm asking this because my ex has been harassing me recently (using my Spotify and messing up my songs, posting our old private conversations to people, and generally talking shit) so I've been trying to message her asking her to stop, and to have a mature conversation. She's unwilling to do that; she says that me contacting her on Discord multiple times is harassment and keeps threatening to go to the police. In the event that she does go to the police, or if she continues harassing me and I can't stop it, I just want to know whether what she did is considered a crime or not (the 15/16 sex) and how serious it is. Thanks! We are situated in Singapore (in case that wasn't obvious p:) Stop contacting her. My brief googling suggests that the age of consent for girls is 16 but under the most conventional of circumstances there is no age of consent for boys, so no crime was committed.
