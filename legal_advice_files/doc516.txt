 I work for a franchised business in Mississippi, but the owner and main company is based in Alabama. I was hired by the previous owner who then sold the franchise to the current owner. The current owner paid his employees in Alabama less than the previous owner and began hiring on new workers at the lower rate. Anyone who had already had a higher rate did not get theirs lowered. I had to get a pay stub for something today and realized that my rate had dropped down from the rate I was hired on at. Is this legal and if not what steps should I take? They need to pay you at the rate you were getting for hours worked. If they notified you of the change then its legal going forward, but they can not change your pay retroactively. Call the labor board.
