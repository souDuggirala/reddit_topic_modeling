 I was arrested in early 2016 for a DWI. I took a breath test at the jail and blew higher than .15 which is a class A misdemeanor. I hired an attorney and was told that because of problems with the arrest I had the possibility of the judge suppressing or dismissing evidence and I might not be able to be charged if we went to trial. My trial date was repeatedly delayed for various reasons such as my attorney having another trial scheduled at the same time and the arresting officer being on vacation in early 2018 until November 27 2018. Today I heard from my attorney that the DA has been granted a continuance which will delay my case until after the end of the year when a new judge will take office. The new judge is highly unlikely to suppress the evidence of my arrest and if I go to trial I have been advised I will almost certainly lose. The DA working my case has offered a plea bargain reducing my sentence to a class b misdemeanor but he can withdraw the offer at any time and I have been advised that if he talks to his superior DA about my case he will be forced to do so. I feel like I am being rushed to accept a guilty plea or be forced into a worse situation with the new judge. Any advice you can give me would be very much appreciated.  Do you have a follow up? What did you end up doing? [removed] You should listen to your lawyer. If you don’t trust that lawyer you should seek a second opinion from a new lawyer. What you’re describing sounds like the fairly ordinary machinations of a legal case and the sorts of decisions defendants must make with the advise of their attorney.
