 So the situation is as follows: A new gym (Gym B) opened up that made a lot of members from Gym A leave. Gym A owner wouldn't let anyone cancel their memberships because he said they were on a contract. However, the contract they signed was for only 2016-2017. He never made anyone sign a new contract year after year and tried claiming that it "auto renews" even though it never said that in the original contract. So people canceled their debit cards so they wouldn't be charged anymore, and now the owner is threatening to take some people to collections. Without any current contract signed, there is nothing the owner can do correct? Or am I missing anything? Let me know if more information is needed. Yup, also always make sure you get your cancellation notice in writing using certified mail. It seems like there are a lot of posts in here with people having problems with their gym charging their card even after they have verbally cancelled. You can use a tool like [jimbgone]() or [docsmit](http://docsmit.com), to send a certified notice online.  Thank you!  It depends on the specifics of the contract. There are really two things the owner would need to make a solid case 1) the contracts noted that it auto-renewed unless otherwise cancelled and 2) there were clear terms on how cancellation needed to occur (i.e. customer must provide notice of cancellation so many days before end of current term). If both of those are in the contract then the owner may be able to argue the contracts are still valid. If those aren't spelled out in the contract then the owner has weak footing as 1) customers didn't agree to auto-renewal and/or 2) customers have voiced their wish to cease the arrangement. The only thing that might give the owner a case if those aren't in the contract is if the customer(s) used the gym after the term ended, it might be usable to show a customer consented to an extension.
