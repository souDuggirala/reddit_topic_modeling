 Is there evidence that water actually reduces the lifespan of these parts or just the companies word for it? How do would know that a given failure was attributable to past water damage or not? If it failed for an unrelated reason why should they be responsible for it? But wear and tear is surely different to water damage. Wear and tear is use over time, water damage is not. Would it not be reasonable to expect them to cover likely future failure? r/legaladviceuk This all depends on the exact legal wording of the guarantee (which I am assuming is an indemnity agreement included in the rental contract). Generally such arrangements cover only direct, physical damage (not wear and tear). Since there is no provable damage at this point and they are not obligated to take any action. If there is a failure of in the future, you have evidence directly linking it to the prior water damage, and the statute of limitations has not expired, you may be due some compensation.
