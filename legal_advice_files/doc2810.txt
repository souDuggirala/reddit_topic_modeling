 Several people have suggested this to me. Just wondering if it is common/legal? Yes, she pays taxes for herself--for her property, because it's her obligation. That's one of our many socialist programs; we pay for things we don't use, or may never use, for the benefit of everyone in our community. The taxpayers in that town, including your mother, collectively pay for the school system: the salaries, and the maintenance, and the materials, and the insurance, and the utilities, etc. They shouldn't, and don't, have to pay to educate the children of parents who don't contribute to paying anything toward the expenses. The people suggesting it to you are encouraging you to commit a crime. Well their grandmother does pay school taxes there, which I suppose is why several people have suggested it to me. You'd be using other people's money, and none of your own, to educate your children. Do you think that's right? It's neither right nor legal. Common, yes. Legal, no. It's fraud, and schools are really getting vicious about convicting people who engage in it. Illegal. That is not legal, the kids need to be registered in the district they actually live in.  This is illegal, and can result in their enrollment being cancelled later.
