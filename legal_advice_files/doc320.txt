 I just found out that one of my college professors is colorblind. I asked him if he has ever heard of Enchroma, which lets colorblind people see colors, and had him take the test to see if he has the right type of colorblindness. Anyways, I was thinking of creating a poster for a bottle depot to raise funds for get him Enchroma glasses, but I want it to be a surprise. Is there a legal issue of using his public image without consent, and also, what is your personal opinion on having your face on a “charity” poster. I don’t want to offend him after all. This is Canada btw It may not be something he broadcasts or wants to be the face of - so consider his privacy. This isn’t legal advice but I knew someone who tried to do something similar and the recipient was extremely embarrassed and upset about it because they felt it violated their privacy. I definitely think it’s a good idea to get his ok on this. Some people feel very weird about taking any type of charity and it would suck that an attempt at a kind gesture on your part could turn into something negative for both of you.
