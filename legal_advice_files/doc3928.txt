 We paid a substantial deposit for a puppy without knowledge of contract terms that put the life of our puppy at serious risk (per our vet), believing it was a home raised puppy based on conversations with and pictures from the breeder. After 6 hour drive we arrived at what I could only describe puppy mill and presented with a ridiculous contract, effectively giving the 'breeder' control over vet decisions and the right to enter our property to take the dog back if they decided we were not caring for it to their standards. The facility was NOT the loving home in the pictures provided, it was a serious of out buildings and what I would call a trailer or manufactured home. It was not some grand palace like the pictured showed. We were told the money we paid was not refundable, and we could leave without the money and without the dog, or sign the contract and take the dog. Being my kids were already holding and naming their puppy, we took the dog back home. The contract demands that we get the dog fixed asap or they can come get him and we have to pay a $25,000 fine (we want him fixed, and want him health as can be), but both our vet and our pet insurance on call vet are encouraging us to wait until his growth plates are fused (im not sure if this is the right term) at 12-18 months. My question is, do I have ground to challenge the following clause based on the recommendation of two vets that we do not fix him until his growth plates are done, and the fact that we were stuck unaware of the terms until after the money was "non refundable". "Buyer agrees to have this puppy spayed/neutered no later than the day the puppy turns 6 months old. If the buyer fails to spay/neuter the above said puppy or uses puppy for breeding the buyer agree to surrender ownership rights of this puppy back to the breeder and buyer agrees to pay $25,000 above the purchase price of the puppy payable to the breeder for liquidated damages if buyer does not have puppy spayed/neutered by said age." I am willing to spend money on an attorney to ensure our pet is maintained in optimal health. TLDR: Dog breeder is demanding via a contract signed under duress that we have surgery performed soon that two vets recommended we wait on, as it will put the dog's life at risk. Puppy tax: , Meet Titan the St Bernard. His normally white fur is stained yellow, and he has a massive flea infestation, but we love him. He will see the groomers later today, to get nice and clean.  Generally speaking, you would have the responsibility to review the contract before sending the money. If you asked and they refused, that should have been a huge red flag. At that point I'd really have a local lawyer who knows contract law well look it over, especially with $25k on the line. I could see needing to do some sort of court action to invalidate that portion of the contract, but what sort, I have no idea. Good luck! Edit: in being curious what, exactly, liquidated damages are I came across the [wiki page](). It has this interesting bit: [common law](), a liquidated damages clause will not be enforced if its purpose is to punish the wrongdoer/party in breach rather than to compensate the injured party[\[2\]]()[\[3\]]()[\[4\]]() (in which case it is referred to as a [penal or penalty clause]()).[\[5\]](,_penalties_and_the_Just_Compensation_rule:_Some_notes_on_an_enforcement_model_and_a_theory_of_efficient_breach-5) One reason for this is that the enforcement of the term would, in effect, require an equitable order of [specific performance](). However, courts sitting in [equity]((law)) will seek to achieve a fair result and will not enforce a term that will lead to the [unjust enrichment]() of the enforcing party.[\[6\]]() First, the amount of the damages identified must roughly approximate the damages likely to fall upon the party seeking the benefit of the term.[\[5\]](,_penalties_and_the_Just_Compensation_rule:_Some_notes_on_an_enforcement_model_and_a_theory_of_efficient_breach-5) Second, the damages must be sufficiently uncertain at the time the contract is made that such a clause will likely save both parties the future difficulty of estimating damages. unliquidated damages, and may be so categorized because they are not mathematically calculable or are subject to a [contingency]() which makes the amount of damages uncertain. This would make it seem like the breeder would need to sue you for specific performance of the contract before they could make the $25k penalty enforceable. Then there's that bit about "courts... will not enforce a term that will lead to the unjust enrichment of the enforcing party". It would be really interesting to hear what an actual lawyer would have to say about all of this. It seems to be a potentially unenforceable clause to your contract...  [deleted] [deleted] Generally, duress needs to be an illegal or illegitimate economic, physical, or psychological threat. Losing your deposit, legally, does not constitute Duress. Whereas, if they'd implied that unless you signed, you'd never be able to own another dog anywhere cause you were on a secret breeders list, and you'd have to pay a fine even beyond the deposit... That gets into Duress.  Generally, in the legal sense, "duress" is pretty extreme. I really. really get that it was a bad no good situation for you. But in most cases, hundreds of dollars would not be "duress". Hundreds of thousands would be. I'm not trying to nitpick words; I'm suggesting that, legally speaking, this is a term that is frequently misunderstood and therefore might not be an angle worth pursuing. [deleted] Your jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of the breeder are actually important here. But as always, the best advice is to talk to a lawyer in real life.  This is nowhere near the legal definition of duress -- that would be realistically fearing for your life or your livelihood, not wanting to say no to your kids (and I am a parent and a pet parent so I get it, but still not duress). Since your vet is on board might he fudge the actual dates and possibly fill out the form early? This may be the shadier side of ethical though... And I completely understand waiting to get dogs fixed. We waited on both of our puppies (not at the same time; consecutive dogs) until 2 for the first and a year and a half for the second. I've only got boxers and don't have some of the problems the bigger dogs have. (we also didn't end up with any puppies from either of them).   $25,000 fine (we want him fixed, and want him health as can be), but both our vet and our pet insurance on call vet are encouraging us to wait until his growth plates are fused (im not sure if this is the right term) at 12-18 months. Your vet is of course correct; early spay/neuter can lead to medical problems for your pet down the road and we lowly pet owners have known this for years. There's no reason for your breeder to not know this. Whether this meets the standard of an "unconscionable" contract in your mystery jurisdiction, and what it'd cost you to prove it in court if the breeder came after you for this ridiculous fine, is definitely one for the lawyers. In your position I'd absolutely stand my ground and not subject my animal to any contracturally-obligated harm from an early neutering; obviously he will be neutered as soon as medically advisable. The more pregnant your dog makes another, the more likely these damages are to become real. [deleted] More and more breeders are having clauses like this, because they do not want you to breed dogs from their line without paying extra to do so. I am not sure this is enforceable in your particular case because the way it was handled seems off, but I have read several other stories like this where it was said to be enforceable. That said, while many vets recommend waiting later in life to fix dogs, others are more than willing to do it earlier. I have had 3 dogs that have all been fixed at 6 months or earlier, and they have had no problems from it. Generally, you should assume what you sign is enforceable. You can take a chance that the breeder won't give a crap about the puppy now that they've got the money. You can always get a short consultation with a local lawyer to get their opinion. I'm not sure what liquidated damages the breeder has if you don't get the puppy neutered that early, but I'm not a lawyer. Maybe someone else will weigh in on that bit. Personally, I'd chance that the breeder doesn't care now that they've got their money. But, a $25k 'fine' is a lot of potentially enforceable money, so it's probably worth the hour with the lawyer to get a real opinion on the matter.
