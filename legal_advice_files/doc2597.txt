 I called the police about someone playing obnoxiously loud bass music down the street. The police said because I live in a rural area they can't do anything about it until 10pm. There has to be some kind of law against someone making sounds that mess with your health such as getting a headache? Why isn't there any law about people weaponizing music? They can enjoy all the music they want idc what they do I just don't want to hear thumping in my walls when I'm trying to work.  If the municipality does not have a sound ordinance they are exceeding, the police can not do anything. Have you, I dunno, \talked\ to the neighbor about it? I don't think the word "weaponizing" really applies here... Call the police and tell them your neighbor is disturbing the peace.
