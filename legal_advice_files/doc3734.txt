 I started working in a hospital about a month ago. They said before I was hired my shift would be 7a-3p. A couple days ago my boss told me I was leaving a half an hour early (I would leave at 3) and I was required to stay until 3:30 until because of my half an hour lunch. I told her okay, I’ll just stop taking lunch since I don’t even eat anyway and I need to leave at 3 because of child care. She told me I was mandated to take a half hour unpaid lunch and stay late to meet my 80 hour biweekly requirement. Before I start anything with her/ hr, am I legally required to take this lunch and stay late?  Thank you for your reply and link to the codes. It’s good to know Ohio is an “at will state”.  You're not legally required to take lunch or stay late, but you can be terminated for refusing, assuming you're under at-will employment with no binding employment contract. There is no legal issue with your boss changing your schedule on-the-fly, or requiring you to work surprise overtime, so long as they're sticking to their own internal policies on the matter. [http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/4113.85v1](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/4113.85v1) In a nutshell, you're asking if you are legally-protected in setting your own schedule against your boss' wishes, and the answer to that is, "No." Employers can mandate lunch Oh sorry I didn't see that OH is Ohio It says Ohio in the title Where at- what state? It's legal to require you to take a lunch. If you continue to work through lunch that's insubordination and you can be legally fired.
