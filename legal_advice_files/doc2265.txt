 My father killed a family member a long time ago. Pretty much no one talks to him now, that I know of. He had a few siblings that did, but they've since passed away. The last time I had contact was about 10 years ago. He doesn't have my address since I moved a lot. Someone contacted me two days ago saying that my father had written a book and needs to talk to me about it. This person that contacted me is a relative of someone that is in the same prison as my father. I was curious as to why he would need to speak to me, so I asked the person what the book was about. It is not about our family or the murder in any way. Let's say it's about something as innocent as bicycles. My father is in a West Virginia prison. Would he have to forfeit the money from book sales were this to make any actual money? Would it go to the state or to the victims family? And lastly, does he need someone on the outside to publish this book/why might he be saying he needs to talk to me (I know it's probably some b.s. reason)?  Because the book isn't about the crime, the state probably can't confiscate any of the profits, except to the extent he owes money for court-ordered restitution as part of a criminal case. If there is an outstanding civil judgment, then whomever holds that judgment would go through the normal steps to collect it. Well, yes, presumably.
