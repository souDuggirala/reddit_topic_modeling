 Hi LA, I’m in Australia, South Australia to be specific. We’ve been in our unit now for just over a year and it’s a pretty decent place overall, a few things that have gone/are wrong but they’re mostly small things that we don’t care about (like not have a toilet roll holder that the owner said would be installed the month after we moved in, in Nov 2017, and having to deal with a bathroom flooding problem for almost a week before it was fixed). But for our last three quarterly inspections I’ve put in a request for the fly screens to be fixed/replaced and have barely gotten a word in response. It’s summer, we want to be opening windows and letting air in but if we do we let all the bugs in and our young cats out (both just over a year). This has resulted in one of our cats getting a broken leg (which cost us $3.5K to fix) after we started opening our kitchen window to let air in, and this morning I’ve woken up with bites all over my arms because I left the bedroom window open and our bed is directly next to it and I’m just sick of it. Can I do anything to fix this myself? The kitchen, bathroom and largest bedroom have no screens (one fell out of the window), the lounge screen has been bent and warped since we moved in and the mesh has fallen out of the second bedroom’s frame and is flapping about.
