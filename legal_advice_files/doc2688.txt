 My father pasted away in 2014, while he was alive I assisted with some of his bills. After his passing I was able to clear most of his creditors with his death certificate with the exception of one. It was a personal loan he took out and I was repaying for him, I presented them with his death certificate and they claimed since I was paying it back most of the time I was liable for the remaining amount. They also told me my name was on the application. I asked for the original application for proof in which they couldn't provide. I have checked my credit score and the company isn't listed there. I then asked for it to be transferred under my name and was told I needed his signature for that. My question is, I've been paying monthly payments for five years now am I actually responsible for this loan? They also threatened a lien on my house and garnish my paychecks. The funny thing is they also send me pre approved offers via mail to me in my name monthly. NAL: If you aren’t on the loan as a co-signer, or the original loan applicant, then you aren’t on the hook for a dime. Since your father passed away, you have 0 obligations outside of presenting the death certificate to dissolve what’s left of the loan. You can safely stop paying on it at any time. My mother could take over my car payment at any point, but I’m still liable for the loan no matter what. I would stop paying on it, and do not make any offers to take ownership of the loan. I would send them a letter with a copy of the death certificate informing them of his passing, and that future payments will no longer be possible.
