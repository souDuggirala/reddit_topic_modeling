 I posted elsewhere asking for home improvement and landscaping advice, but I think this might be more of a legal issue... I'm in NJ I want to fence or otherwise block off the back of my yard to keep my kids from falling off a cliff at the end of my property. Both of my neighbors have fences, so I was trying to connect to those fences along the property line. The issue is that one of my neighbor's yard is higher than mine, and so his fence isn't along the property line, but set in about 5 feet. So, to close in my yard on the property line, I'd need to run a lot of fence just to close in this unused, sloped section of his yard. Seems like a waste of money and will look rather weird too since he has a privacy fence, and I will have a picket or chain-link. I would think it would be ideal for me to just buy that section of his yard, but I assume the legal work would be more expensive than a fence? I also considered just connecting to his fence at the end of the yard, but I think I'd be taking adverse possession of that land? If I did a natural hedge along the back in lieu of a fence, would it still be possible adverse possession? This neighbor is nice, and I'm sure he'll be open to whatever, but I just don't want to screw him over. I just wanted to understand the legal implications before talking to him. So if I make it clear that I’m just planting or fencing without the intent to posses that plot of land, we’d be OK? Sounds good Adverse possession in NJ requires 20 years before it can even be a thing. And if he gives you his permission, then adverse possession cannot apply in any case.
