 Unfortunately, I don't have much more information than what's in the title. She was pulled over today for driving on a suspended license, but never received notification from the DMV that it was suspended. She hasn't moved since she got her license, so there's no reason for the notification to not end up in her mailbox. What steps should she expect to take moving forward? [deleted] Happens all the time. Was she given a civil or criminal citation?  Pay the ticket and pay the fee to have the license reinstated. Also find out why it was suspended.
