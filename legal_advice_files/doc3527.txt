 As the title says, I got a speeding ticket late 2013 but moved out of country for work and been living here (South Korea) since. I wanted to renew my drivers license and I can't until this ticket is cleared up. How should I deal with this collection agent? I just want to get my license renewed. Thanks! (FYI it happened in WA where I am a resident of)  So frustrating... thanks for the advice. How can I check for a warrant? It would be a bench warrant right? Do you know what that means exactly vs another type of warrant? Yes. Failure to appear to court. You can do what I did, I had an attorney take care of it for me. I also live out of the country and I didnt have to do anything. Except pay the ticket after the court date but the attorney got one violation removed and my speeding ticket became a parking ticket. Oh jesus. That can happen for a speeding ticket? You should make sure you don't have a warrant for your arrest.
