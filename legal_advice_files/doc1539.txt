 One of my family members has been trying to access tax refunds from 2018 but the bank is refusing to release them. She filed with an accountant and requested a check, but the accountant had it sent as a Walmart Money Card without telling her. My family member received the card and was extremely suspicious of it because she didn't sign up for any cards. There was no information about why the card was sent her way, and there was no balance. She immediately called to report identity theft and her account has been locked. She eventually found out that it was the refund but by then she's been given the runaround by everybody-- by the bank, the accountant, and the IRS. The bank refuses to release the refund because the freeze could apparently only be undone by a written letter from the IRS. The IRS says they are only responsible for ensuring the refund was deposited to the correct account (it technically was), and will not take further action because they did their part. They suggested to pressure the bank by speaking with higher ups but the reps just hang up when they don't want to deal with the call. The accountant disappeared. She's been trying to get her refund back for the last year and it's been really trying. How can she get it back? What can we do? Alternatively, if this isn't the right place to post, what other places do you suggest posting? This is in the US.  Keep calling. Over and over. You need to find a time when you can camp on the phone and hold till they will answer The supervisors are conveniently not available. The one time I got a higher up person they hung up on me. The bank is with the Walmart money card and they don't have any local branches. Their headquarters are located in California. I don't live there.  How far down the line have they gone with the bank? Keep making noise with more senior individuals until you get someone more helpful than a call center agent. Set an appointment with the local branch manager if there is one
