 I don't mind paying the ticket, it's actually old car, has a flat and I'm waiting for Kars 4 kids to pick up. I had left in my parents driveway and they felt necessary to put in street. I'm expecting it to be towed within week. Should I be fine leaving on street or will I keep being ticketed in upcoming days? Stupid question any help would be appreciated
