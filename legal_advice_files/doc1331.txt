 Maryland. Wife is being sued for a credit card debt. Last time we were sued in Circuit Court, and I had to write up and submit a formal answer. We won that case. This time, we are being sued in small claims District Court. In the summons packet we were served with, I see a simple Notice of Intention to Defend doc, which has a small line that says "Brief explanation of defense". Is that it? No formal answer? She just writes a sentence and signs the Intention to Defend? Thanks Small claims cases are typically more informal than a full lawsuit is. Maryland has a full list of differences [online](), but a few major notes: It is less common to use lawyers, though Maryland does allow them. There is a $5000 limit on awards. Appeals are a full retrial in normal court. It looks like Maryland also has a [short (\~7 minute) video]() with the basics for how to defend against a small claims case. You can also [get advice]() in person or via phone.
