 Good afternoon! This past Tuesday, my dad was leaving work (he was coming out of a very dark parking lot, and making a right hand turn) at about midnight. The company he works for was having some paving done, and they left an equipment trailer (like you'd put a backhoe on) sitting in the road, it was sort of off to the side, but still more than half on the road. My dad made the turn and by the time he saw the trailer, he couldn't react and he crashed into the ramp on the back of the trailer. We contacted our insurance company and the car is now totaled. We have tons of pictures, and the police report says that the trailer was parked in the road. The trailer was more than half on the road, was on a dark road, with no cones or anything like that around it and no reflectors or lights of any kind. Now, my parents dont have a car, and the payout from the insurance company isnt enough to cover the cost of the loan. They dont have money at the moment to make up the balance, or to put a down payment on something else. Can we go after the paving company?  Your insurance company could attempt to go after the company to recoup what they've paid out. You've already been paid out for the car, which is all your entitled to. It's unlikely the insurance company would be successful as drivers are responsible for avoiding stationary objects, but in the case of black trailer lacking required safety equipment there is a chance.
