 Over a month ago, we complained to our property manager (who is a liaison between the tenants and the landlord) that something needed to be done about our driveway because it floods every time it rains, causing us to either not park in the driveway or have to wade through inches of water to get to our cars. Landlord agreed to have more gravel put down. As I said, it has now been over a month. We are only getting updates from the property manager if we contact her. She never calls us back, only texts, and overall the communication has been poor. The landlord was supposed to find out a delivery date Monday and so far we have no answers. Not only is this a nuisance, but it has become a safety hazard as well. With the freezing temperatures, the puddles in the gravel (which is now mostly dirt in some places) have frozen and my s/o slipped and nearly fell this morning when going to his car. According to what I have found online, Virginia law requires that a landlord: Make all repairs needed to keep the place fit and habitable (livable). Keep the common areas clean and safe. Maintain the place so as to prevent the accumulation of moisture and the growth of mold. ... among other things, but these requirements seem most applicable to the situation. Do we have any grounds to take legal action if this continues to be a problem? We don't ask for much, but the property manager has been very snippy about the whole situation, stating that she can't make the landlord do anything. All I have asked for is some open communication regarding a timeline, especially considering the landlord and the people he has hired to do work have shown up without giving us notice in the past. I am also worried that they will refuse to offer us a lease renewal because of our request and because we have been asking for some kind of update. We are otherwise decent tenants who pay on time and rarely ask for anything, and when we do it's a legitimate concern. Any insight would be helpful. TIA.
