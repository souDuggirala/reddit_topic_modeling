 This all happened in the late 80s, I am relaying information from my parents. My grandfather passed away many years ago, and more recently my grandmother passed. We were going through their documents and found a minerals right claim to a natural gas well on a piece of property they had owned previously. Purportedly, the gas company had set the well and leased their land, but never pumped any gas or paid any royalties then bought out the rights for a couple thousand dollars" after saying the well was a bust. My grandparents moved shortly after, a couple of years later my parents drove by the property and saw they had started pumping gas well. Do we have any rights to reclaim royalty payments? It seems like the gas company bought the mineral claim back in bad faith. I had added some information to my original post. There are management companies that evaluate royalty properties in terms of selling prices. It might be useful to find one and just run the facts past them for the peace of mind. Just google natural gas royalty property sales. Here is one at random - I don't know anything about them - I'm betting that your grandparents sold at the bottom when NG was $1/MMBTU and the company purchased in speculation of higher prices - plus having the additional 1/8 would be a plus - especially since the well(s) were already drilled and thus a sunk cost. They - the company probably did a production estimate, so they knew what actually was in the ground, so there was probably very little risk to them.  Thanks, I am doing my due diligence for my folks on this, I generally feel the same way. I was researching to see if this was common practice or not, and it has been difficult to find information. Not an attorney, but owns some oil gas interests. At best it's going to be difficult, at worst perhaps impossible. The best you can do is to find an attorney who specializes in contracts and hopefully has some oil and gas background. The core of the issue is that your grandparents probably had no real knowledge in oil and gas and just relied on what ever the company told them - essentially the core issue is contracts law. Were they being induced to sell based on untrue facts. On one hand at the time of the sale, the well(s) might not have been commercially viable, but with new technology - possibly became commercially viable. Thus, the company may not have deceived your grandparents - or perhaps, just didn't provide the entire story. A third issue is, if the well(s) were not commercially viable, why would the company want to buy the property? Another question will be - was the selling price below market - were your grandparents taken advantage of? With your grandparents having passed away, this all essentially becomes the traditional he said, she said issue. ______________________________ Most states require production companies to submit monthly production data, so you can go back in time and see the exact production data for that well(s). It's usually publicly accessible via the internet if you have the well identifier numbers. With this data, you can go back and see historically, how profitable the well was and if it's even worthwhile pursuing anything given that your grandparents may have been taken advantage of. ---- There is usually a printed sign near the well with the well identifier numbers(s) Natural gas spiked ($14 per MMBTUs) a number of years ago, then fell to $1 per MMBTUs - so, based on the time frame, due to natural gas prices, it might have been unprofitable to put the well(s) into production. The company may have purchased the property based on speculation of rising natural gas prices (prices currently at around $4 +/- and change). =NG p=m1 Royalty rates are traditionally 1/8 or 12.5% of the well head price. Also, it may have not been commercially viable for the company (just owning the working interest) if they did not own the royalty stream. Lots of variables to all of this.
