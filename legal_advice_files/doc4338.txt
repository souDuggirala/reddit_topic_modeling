 My 20yr old brother who lives in MA has received 3 speeding tickets in the past year and will have his license suspended for 30 days once he pays for this third ticket. He has already told me that he will continue driving even with the suspended license to get to work. He has to drive quite a distance for some of his job sites, so the potential for him to be caught is very high. What consequence could he face if caught driving with a suspended license? I’m assuming misdemeanor charges and jail time. He is a member of a union and does most of his work with the union, as well as taking apprenticeship classes with the union. Could this effect his union membership? He also rents an apartment. Any possible consequences relating to this? I just don’t think he grasps the gravity of the situation he is currently in and I need to explain this to him as someone who cares about his future.  Operating a motor vehicle after your driver's license has been suspended is a criminal violation in Massachusetts. The penalty upon conviction, 1st offense for operating after suspension (OAS) is up to 10 days in jail, or a fine not less than $500 up to $1,000; or both jail and fine
