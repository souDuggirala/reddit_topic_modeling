 So almost a year ago, the property was purchased by someone else. It's a 3 floor, (2 and a basement w/access) we currently occupied the ground floor, and the basement is used by us. Landlord just informed us today that they're going to be remodeling it to another apartment starting next week. Now we're not under contract anymore and I understand it is his property to do so whatever he so chooses. However, I feel like that is a little short notice on top of the fact that I've been living in this residence for over 2 years nearly 3 years. So what can I do or say about it? We will still have access to a portion of the basement (however I own a motorcycle, which makes this a little more difficult, since I store it down there for the winter. How does the lease describe the leased premises? Updated Original Post We need to know the location.
