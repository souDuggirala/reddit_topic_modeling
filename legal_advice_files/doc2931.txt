 Sorry for the complex question, here's the foundation. Lets say, hypothetically, that I am registered to practice before the USPTO, and am registered to practice law in my home state. I decide to move to Virginia to practice patent law. I know I don't need to be admitted to Virginia prosecute patent law in Virginia, but will I need admission to Virginia's bar to participate in post-grant proceedings at the USPTO? Or would it be DC? or the Federal court of appeals? Is the answer the same for filing a patent infringement suit? Next question. Lets say I do get admitted to Virginia's bar. I have a client in Delaware that wants to lease patents from an overseas company. Do I need to be admitted to practice in Delaware to write up the licensing contract for the Delaware client? Would the answer change if the Delaware client is leasing patents from a Virginia company? Thanks for the advice.
