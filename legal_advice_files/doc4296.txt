 Negotiating a severance agreement with a law firm. I am not an attorney. I have very strong arguments as confirmed by legal counsel I have consulted with. the strongest being a potential grievance against the firm for paying a non atty as a partner. the firm initiated negotiations with a low ball offer and I responded with a simple - My number is \_\_\_\_. The firm responded by asking what my basis for my number was. I believe I should respond with short simple answer such as - it is based on my desire to resolve this matter in an amicable fashion so all can proceed forward accordingly. I do not want to be tricked into giving a threatening answer or other that will only hurt me down the road. Suggestions on a response?  You have an attorney. You need to ask them We really cannot tell you how to respond in negotiations. That could create an attorney client relationship. Post deleted
