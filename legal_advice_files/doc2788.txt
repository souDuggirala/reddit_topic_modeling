 It's looking more and more likely that I'm going to be leaving my verbally/emotionally abusive spouse and heading back to my home country to start over. Since I don't want to linger any longer than I have to, I understand an uncontested divorce can be completed without a court hearing. I haven't been divorced before and don't really know how the property division works. We have no debts to speak of. The house is paid off. We have one vehicle between us. We have a savings account and each have a business account for separate small businesses. I have an annuity which was paid into while our finances were completely merged. She took early retirement and we currently live primarily on those payments (she wanted to move to a rural area). Do we split everything down the middle? Do we ignore the annuity and pension to keep it simple? What happens with business accounts? I just want to do what's fair, and as I would be leaving I wouldn't want to leave her with a payout she can't afford. I also don't want the judge to call a hearing if at all possible, so he/she would obviously need to see what looks like a fair settlement.
