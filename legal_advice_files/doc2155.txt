 I'm in the process of buying a condo and 4 days before the closing, my lender informs me that I the condo unit didnt qualify for a conventional loan due to it being a new building. My lender was able to offer me a portfolio loan that uses an ARM 7 rate. The question I have is that he promised that I could refinance into a 30 year fixed loan at no cost at a later date if I wanted to. I asked him to put that in writing and he sent me an email saying that would be sufficient. Is that email sufficient enough? Trust has no place here. If it's not in the signed contract, you will have a hard time enforcing it. Your interests come first when making a business deal.  If he can offer you a 30 year loan, why can't he do it now? Only way you could do it with a non-warrantable condo would be a portfolio loan. Once the complex is complete, you can probably do a 30 year conventional loan. Only thing the lender can legitimately promise is the no cost refi. It would still have to meet all Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac guidelines, at a minimum. I'm not sure what kind of document that would be. The lender hasn't been shady at all with me so I would trust him but I do want to have my ass covered. If you want to eventually end up in litigation or arbitration to get them to follow through on what they promised in the e-mail then it's enough. If you want a smooth process down the road when you refinance I would make certain it's in any loan documents you sign.
