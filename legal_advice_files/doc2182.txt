 New Year’s Eve a water line busted on my side of the meter and wasn’t discovered until late that night. While I still had water, the pressure was low. I contacted my landlord the next morning (01/01). Plumbers weren’t sent to the property until yesterday (01/03) when they couldn’t find the leak before dark, they turned my water off and left. They called me today and said they couldn’t work because of rain and won’t be back until Monday. So now I’m left without water until at least Monday. I’ve contacted my landlord and he suggested that I go shower at the neighbors (who I’ve never met) and that was about it. Is this even legal and is there anything I can do?
