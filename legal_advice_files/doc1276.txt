 I'm being sued and the person suing me contacted me and left me a voicemail. Should I not contact him? Should this communication not go through his lawyer? Is that some kind of rule or guideline? OP didn't indicate if the plaintiff was represented or not; it seems more likely to me that OP is assuming the plaintiff has representation (rather than explicitly indicating it). But OP's summons will indicate whether the plaintiff has representation. If the plaintiff has representation, then of course any communications should go through said representation.  Thank you.  's small claims the plaintiff might not have a lawyer. OP indicated that the plaintiff is represented: his lawyer?  Ignore the other guy who responded. There's nothing unlawful about the plaintiff contacting you directly. But it might not be in your interest to respond to him. Since you're being sued by a lawyer, it would be in your best interest to hire a defense attorney, if you can. Sounds good. Thank you. If it's small claims the plaintiff might not have a lawyer. It's not an uncommon tactic for people who don't have representation to call the defendant/respondent and try to negotiate settlement rather than going through the rigmarole of a trial and subsequent collection efforts. You should play back the voicemail, determine if the plaintiff is interested in negotiating in good faith, and proceed from there. Without knowing the content of the voicemail any other advice would be speculative.
