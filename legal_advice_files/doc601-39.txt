I need a lawyer that can do our case pro bono in Southern Illinois.
We got illegally evicted, currently living in a camper. This woman has harassed us, threatened us, and slandered us. All of the things that we own are still in the home. She won’t let us come get them.
My mom is disabled and we cannot afford a lawyer. We’re losing everything. We can’t afford to go up to Chicago to get a lawyer for pro bono, that’s why I am asking here. I am desperate. Please help my family.
