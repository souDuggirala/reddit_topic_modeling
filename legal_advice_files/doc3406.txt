 Im not sure if im posting to the correct place. I have only read 3 book series and the book I'd like to write isn't related to either of them at all. I know there are a plethora of books in the world, but I haven't read many of them. How does one know whether their idea is original or not? Is this the publishers job? Is there some way to search for this? I'm in Alabama so the bot doesn't come for me.  You can't copyright an idea, so you're good there. My writing advice is to read plentifully, both in your genre and outside it. Yeah, generally, as long as you're not copying another book word for word or using the exact same plot, you're clear. You can write a book on the same topic or story line somebody else has already written.
