 Is it illegal to inform someone's employer via email about an employee of theirs' bad behavior outside of work? If someone was taking your pictures on Facebook and adding rude captions and posting them to Facebook and saying vulgar things, while simultaneously bragging about their position in a company, is it illegal to screenshot and send to their employer to inform them of their employees behavior?  The editorializing is unnecessary.  Thanks for the response, appreciate it.  Nope, go right ahead. No, it's just immature.
