 I’m in Montreal and some guy in the uk pressured me into sending him nudes through Instagram. And now he’s threatening to expose me if I don’t give him my address and he’s threatening to make me his sex slave and that he’ll rape me every hour of the day. He’s only 16 but I’m 13. Can I take legal action?
