 I had suicidal thoughts and admitted myself to a mental hospital. I asked before I admitted myself if I could leave whenever I wanted. They said yes.The environment made me more anxious and I wanted to leave badly. My condition worsened. Yes, I did sign paperwork when I was admitted which likely went against what I was told. Is any of this illegal? NY. You voluntarily admitted yourself and then you say that your "condition worsened." He will probably then put on a 72-hour hold if your condition worsened. It's completely legal. Yeah what they did was perfectly legal and proper procedure on any locked ward.  I'm home now. This already happened. I just wasn sure if it was legal. And when I said "it", I meant depression, not willingness to hurt myself. I wasn't clear on that
