 I was wrongly accused of theft and it would be my first offense in my 21 years of living and nothing valuable was stolen, i think its like $35 worth of items. Its labelled a class B misdemeanor so it doesnt seem too serious but it means i dont get a public defender. I cant afford a private lawyer and im not confident in myself to defend myself and i dont trust the justice system to find me innocent ( have a very bleak view on the situation). Is it possible to request the charges be dropped against me? Im aware they are not obligated to do so i was just wondering if i can do that. Because ive been extremely stressed out for months because of this and i was thinking they might drop them because of the circumstances. Im also worried because the police change details of my encounter with them and it feels hopeless. Sure you can ask. But they are under no obligation to do so.
