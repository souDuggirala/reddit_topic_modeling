 So I bought a mattress from purple and it started to sag, I went thru the warranty process and they agreed to send a replacement. They accidentally sent two replacement mattresses. I tried in good faith to return the extra one, they have become real tools though and are making it over burdensome for me to return it. Do I have any legal right to not return it? See, Iâ€™m kind of thinking that the second mattress is unsolicited and if i understand correctly, If something arrives through the mail unsolicited at your house you can keep it without being charged?  I don't really see any legal standing for the company to have them bring down the duplicate. I can't even find a law that address the shipping of duplicates It seems reasonable that you would need to bring it down to the front door if it was originally delivered there and not your door. It's not yours and you don't get to keep it. I bet they'll let you buy it, if it's too much of a hassle to bring it down.  [removed] They have made fedex appointments without telling me therefor I miss it, they expect me to carry the mattress down 4 stories. After I had to pay someone to get it up.  What is the burden in the return process?
