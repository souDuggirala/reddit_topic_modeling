 We moved into new construction a month ago during winter and heat seemed to work fine. Turns out we've been using emergency heat all month because the heat pump outside wasn't connected to the system. We called a service technician to fix it and we paid him for it. Is the home builder responsible for this or are we at fault since we took delivery of the home as is? There's no way to know without looking at the details of your warranty. I would file a claim with them anyway.  We have a warranty but I didn't think it would cover stuff they didn't even finish. I thought it was for stuff that broke before it should have. Are you sure you don't have a new build warranty?
