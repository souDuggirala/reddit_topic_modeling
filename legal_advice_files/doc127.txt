 Plain and simple: my UFC gym told me that in order to cancel my membership, I’d have to pay hundreds of dollars because of the year contract. I had an idea of just closing the college debit account that the subscription is tied to and starting a new bank account. Then I thought, “wow that sounds very illegal”. Is it? "I wanna quit the gym!!" "I wanna quit the bank!!" Sorry, couldn't help the "Friends" reference. I'm not a lawyer. It's not illegal (at least not criminally so), but you would be sent to collections and possibly sued. In my more irresponsible days, I had a recurring gym membership charged to a credit card. I didn’t want to pay anymore, so I thought I would just cancel the credit card. They simply sent my account to collections. Eventually I had to write them a check to get the debt off my back. Now it’s not illegal to not pay your debt. We stopped prosecuting people for that in the 19th century. But not paying your debt to the gym will negatively effect your credit, and of course, they can sue you for the money. They can still take you to collections, if they're motivated to make you honor your contract. I'd guess at least 50% chance they'll do that. Why not just keep going? Why are you trying to weasel out of a contract that you signed willingly? If you want out, pay the fine. It's not illegal to close a bank account but you will still owe them the money. No, but they will just send it to a collection agency which will negatively impact your credit. They also can ban you from ever returning to one of their gyms (including ones owned by them which may not go by the UFC name). It's not worth potentially ruining your credit. Certainly. Won't solve your problem. They will just ruin your credit and you will likely end up sued I don't think it is illegal. But they may send your bill to collections or sue you.
