 Well, the law's only good here for getting her money or out of her lease. If she doesn't want either of those things, you can always just yell at the landlord until you feel better. Maybe the city has a program this type of thing can be reported to, but likely if landlord is already in process of fixing the issue diligently, there's not much else they would do. IANYL. Its a good thing you said any state other than Arkansas. The landlords here don't have any duty to provide a habitable house. They roof could be caving in and they don't have to fix it. Thankfully Texas landlords do. Did they report it to the landlord that there was no heathing?
