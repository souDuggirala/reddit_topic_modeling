 My company is currently in progress of being taken to court for not compensating for a 30 minute lunch break that is potentially interrupted. In Colorado, after 5 hours you are entitled to a 30 minute uninterrupted lunch otherwise it will have to be compensated for. Since this is a collective action and not class action lawsuit, what would happen if the first filing of the lawsuit is pushed through and I have yet to sign on as a plaintiff? Do I still ha r any time to sign onto this lawsuit? Iâ€™ve worked for over 4 years and each yeah I lose out on 42 hours of time and a half pay (even more since I pick up overtime). We all know the company is going to lose the lawsuit, as it has previously in another state but is there anything I can do to become part of the lawsuit? FYI this is a throwaway.
