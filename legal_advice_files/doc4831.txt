  Good friend of mine has crashed into a ditch after realizing that drinking and driving is hard. We’re not sure how the DWIs work in Colorado, and I’m just looking to find the best course of action. Also happy Thanksgiving. Being in a crash means the police had probable cause to investigate him for DUI. The court also universally treats crashed DUIs as far more serious than normal DUI. His options are now incredibly limited. He needs a lawyer to properly investigate those options. He needs to look through his paperwork, contact a lawyer, and get that lawyer to work out whether or not it's worth appealing his year long DMV suspension before it kicks in (7 DAYS from the arrest).  [removed] Your friend needs a lawyer.  He should get a lawyer. He should not talk to the police about this.
