 My mother rented a room to a couple and after a couple of month's we got sick and tired of their fights and toxicity and now we're trying to kick them out. One of them told my mother straight to her face that she can't because the law says she has to give them a 30 day notice. How can we get rid of them? You can ask them to leave but if they won’t you have to lawfully evict them.  You don’t need a written lease to be a tenent. If they cause damage, you can itemize it and withhold an appropriate amount of the security deposit. If the damage exceeds the deposit, you sue them for the difference. You can’t just throw them out with a moments notice. The law looks poorly on forcing someone to be suddenly homeless.  Then start the eviction process. Since they're not paying you will be a lot better off than if they were paying. But the problem here now is that they were supposed to pay us 2 days ago and now they're coming up with excuses. Could we tell them to leave due to failure of payment? They are tenants and they are entitled to notice. One way around this is to pay them to leave and take all their stuff with them. Make them sign a receipt for the payment and acknowledgment that they are leaving the premises voluntarily. It doesn't matter. They're tenants. You have to give them notice. You might offer to waive some rent or give them some money to leave sooner, but you can't force it. They're not on the lease or anything. Plus I'm worried what they'd do if we left them alone.  They're not wrong. Give them 30 days written notice right now.  Give them 30 days notice.  Are they month to month tenants? Start by giving them a written 30 day notice.
