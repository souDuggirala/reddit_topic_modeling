 Check Thanks for your input! I appreciate it.  You have zero legal right to move. They are being nice and letting you change units, even if they are charging their normal fees. Your right to quiet enjoyment isn't being infringed upon, and no one can guarantee you your safety. Call the police if you're worried about someone hurting you. When talking to management, be nice, make no demands, because you have no legal leg to stand on here.
