 Hello. I've lived in the same apartment for 2 1/2 years, and recently my dog put a nice chunk in my carpet that's beyond repair. When I move out, I'll have been at this unit for 3 years and the complex itself for 6. I do pay pet rent, I believe I paid a pet deposit as well. My question is- after this much time in the same unit are they able to charge me for the cost of the carpet? I had pets when I moved in and I'm pretty sure the carpet was not new then so the question isnt what should they do, but what can they do? I want to make sure I have the appropriate amount of money set aside for when I move out, or knowledge if there's something stating that there's a max I should be charged. I could attempt to patch it..but it would probably be noticeable and I'm 75% sure they would want to replace it new for the next tenant anyways. Thanks! It seems to be tacked, so even if it was new when I moved in (it wasn't) it's over halfway through it's life. Thanks!! Thank you! Luckily it's just in one room so I will try to get an estimate before that happens. I've been toying with the idea of letting them know about the damage now but I don't want them to have any incentive to charge me if they already may plan on replacing when I decide not to renew.   The amount you could owe would cap at that depreciated value. They can charge you for replacement cost, and for the whole apartment, but they have to take depreciation into account and have to provide for the age of the carpet.
