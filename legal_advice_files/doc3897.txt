 Last month I got a call from a number I didn't know so I ignored it. They left a message regarding my estranged sister and they knew my name. Company seems like a legitimate bail bonds company((although I could be wrong) 9093322906). I live in California and all the websites I've visited to try and see what is going on fine print has been dubious at best. She is my sister and I love her, I don't think it is a scam, I'm more than willing to bail her out but i need to know what she did. I don't want to be involved in something terrible. How do I find out what happened?  Thank you. I will do that. I was really looking to see if I could do it online without having to call 1,000,000 people but I guess not. Thanks again! Call back the number, ask for the court case number/county of the bond request. Then check the information they give you with the county courthouse (or its website) to verify your sister has a pending case against her.
