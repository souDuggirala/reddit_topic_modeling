 Hi there! My doctor is amazing and I wanted to show my appreciation. I made him a card and I wanted to make some gingerbread men aswell. I know ots illegal for doctors to accept gifts but I was hoping homemade things would be acceptable. I live in Canada by the way.  You can avoid many of the issues with gifts by giving them to “you and your wonderful staff” In general, medical staff are usually told they can’t accept gifts (in the USA) because it’s against company policy. However, people usually bring in food/goodies and you bet the medical staff eats them. Usually if it’s “for the staff” or food it’s fine.  I think OP is confusing the illegality of gifts from medical supply companies/pharmaceutical reps with gifts from unaffiliated patients. I believe there is nothing wrong with the latter  I don't know for certain, but it's possible OP was thinking of limitations on doctors accepting gifts from vendors or interest groups. Great, thanks. If he says not then I get to eat them all so it's a win/win Okay, I think I'm going to offer them still, if he says no then more cookies for me :) Awesome, thank you! Give it to em Yes.  Many doctors will not accept gifts to avoid any boundary violations or claims of misconduct. However, from the literature I've found, it's not illegal. That being said, the card would suffice. I don't think this is the kind of gifts the law is designed to prevent. There is no harm in offering them, so long as you are not bothered if the doctor has to reject them.  What makes you think that?
