 My landlord requires me to inform them of any guest that will be staying at my place and also requires me to pay $5 per night per guest. The contract says that I need to give them a notice whenever someone stays at my place (which I am fine with) but there is nothing about paying $5/night for guests staying over. Is this grounds for breaking my lease? Stop paying. Be prepared to move out when the lease is up.  You did as a matter of fact agree to pay, since you paid. But you can argue in court you felt threatened by the risk of eviction. Never agreed to pay. I figured it was in the contract. But after reading the contract multiple times, there is nothing in there about paying the $5/night. maybe. You can always sue and let the judge decide. But it sounds like you agreed to pay it. If you stop paying it going forward, and your LL tries to evict you, then go to the court hearing and show it's not in your lease. How any months and how frequently were you paying? There's an argument to be made that because you repeatedly paid, you agreed to the fee.  Can I get my money back for all the months I have already paid?  If it's not in the lease, it's grounds for not paying. This isn't a material breach of the lease at this point.  I can't imagine it's grounds to break the lease, but it is grounds to tell the landlord you won't pay anything you haven't agreed to in writing.
