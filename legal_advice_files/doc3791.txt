 I live in California, but spend a lot of time in Missouri for work. A friend of mine is letting me keep a car in his garage in Missouri. Missouri seems to require Missouri plates registration in order for a car to be kept there. But the car is in my name, and I do not have a residential address there. Surely there is a way to keep a car in Missouri that I own, while only having a California residential address. What can I do? (If it helps, I have family in Missouri)
