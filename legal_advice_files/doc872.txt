 So today I got a call from Thomas George Associates about a recent file opened against me. I got into a car accident last May, uninsured thanks to a Geico glitch telling me I was insured but actually wasnt. No one was hurt, my roommate was in the passenger side and got a slight cut. Other person was completely fine. Played property damage of settlement of 2700 last September. But now he is coming after me for bodily injury for 100k. This doesnt add up since he was walking and talking just fine immediately after the accident. I dont know what to do about this since I'm pretty sure 100k is way too much for any car related incident, and I shouldn't be having to pay this. Is there any way I can fight against it?  By the way, opening demands from attorneys are often vastly overvalued because they expect negotiation and it gives them the ability to move the value down and induce you to move your offer up. Also, some injury does not manifest itself as pain until hours or days following an accident.
