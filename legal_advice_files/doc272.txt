 So I work in IT and currently we only get paid half our hourly rate for any overtime hours we work. My lead says according to his boss it's because we're classified as exempt since we're salaried and have fluctuating work schedules....but we dont have fluctuating schedules, we have scheduled shifts and our management requires us to work at least 40 hours a week and to make up hours if we miss them for whatever reason. Is this something I can report to the TWC? I don't really wanna talk to HR or anyone here for fear of retribution if they end up having to backpay us or at least start paying us overtime going forward.
