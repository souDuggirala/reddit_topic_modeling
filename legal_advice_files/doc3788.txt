 So in this article by buzzfeed they just rip the top posts from /r/penmanshipporn and that’s it. They credit the users who posted the pictures but never asked for permission or anything. If they are making revenue off of views to the page, is stealing our content without permission ethical? Or is this a non-issue?  Buzzfeed and another site has done that to one of my posts. There's a way of requesting they remove the image, however it got me nowhere, they just ignored it. You can file a dmca and that's about it.  FTFY Yep. Buzzfeed is horrible.  Gotcha, that’s good to know. Thank you. This shitty “journalist” doesn’t even talk about the art, just copies and pastes other people work and he gets credit for the article? Pretty annoying The owner of the image can request that the images be removed under copyright law. Lots of ^shitty websites do this. There is a site call BoredPanda that steals every single top post (and comments!) from choosingbeggars.
