 I got injured (badly) at work a couple months ago, long story short I'm still dealing with concussion symptoms 2 months out and was diagnosed with PTSD as well. With PTSD I am eligible for a medical marijuana card in my state (Illinois) however I know my work is receiving every medical record for me, even pre injury. For the record, I peed clean (legitimately) in the emergency room so they can't say I was high at the time of the accident. But I do want to use medical cannabis as I'm positive it will help alleviate my symptoms and I feel like it's my right to be able to with my condition. My real question here is what can my work really do about this aside from threaten to drug test me upon my return to work? What if I go to one of those weed friendly doctor places and don't tell them about it? Would that constitute fraud? (Since my PTSD was caused by the work injury). This all seems like a really gray area to me and I thought you guys may have some good advice for me so thank you in advance to anyone for your responses. NAL: If your disability is temporary, and you intend to go back to the same job, I would say to steer clear of weed. They will likely drug test you at least once when you go back to work, and popping hot for weed is grounds for termination on the spot. Furthermore, weed is not a miracle drug that’s going to help your PTSD symptoms. I and several of my friends who are war vets manage our PTSD just fine without weed. As far as going to a weed friendly doctor, if they are required to send your medical information to your employer for your workman’s comp, the weed doctor will be no different. He will have to report everything, the same as any other doctor.
