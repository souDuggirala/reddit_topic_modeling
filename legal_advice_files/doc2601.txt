 (Mobile, rip formatting, also lurker.) The business I work at recently discovered our pipes are completely clogged and backed up. When we called in a plumber over the weekend to determine the issue, he said that the pipes were set up completely different from the blueprints we were given when the store was originally set up ~7 or 8 years ago and they were not sloped whatsoever. This store is not owned by the business, but is a rental space. As I'm not technically management (I'm a keyholder), I'm not sure what the specifics of the contract are without revising the email our landlord had sent us about facility repair responsibility. From what it sounds like, we will end up needing to pull out the concrete and piping to completely replace them. As far as I'm aware, there should be no food waste, feminine products, flushable wipes or other similar items going down the drain. There is a good amount of pet hair in our store, but we do our best to ensure pet hair is kept out of the pipes. There aren't many trees located around our store, so I'm unsure if tree roots are a problem. Any advice on this issue is appreciated since it looks like it could be a massive expense for our store. From what I was told by the plumber, it sounded like these pipes were going to clog eventually regardless due to how they were set up, but we haven't torn up the floor yet to get down to the area of concern. What is your legal question? Commercial leases can be complicated, even with respect to responsibility for repairs. If landlord is responsible for some repairs then there may be a reasonable argument that the instant repair is not a result of misuse of the drains but of the state of the property. Obviously there may be arguments on both sides of that.
