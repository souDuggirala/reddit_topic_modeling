 I live in a duplex that has been turned into two condos. I own one, and we'll call the other owner Brad. As a result, the HOA consists of only two units. Now Brad has been difficult since he bought his unit. Spray painting inside the house then closing it up so the fumes permeate my place, hiring sub par contractors to do work where they end up cutting into the structural members of the house, etc. Recently, he hasn't been paying his monthly HOA dues. He's now several months behind. When we contact him (via email so there's a paper trail) about it, he says he'll pay it right away, but doesn't. It's been weeks of this. Because there are only two units, there isn't much in the HOA account so we can't afford to have him not pay. What are my options moving forward? I'm in CA if that matters. Yep, an association with only 2 members. It super blows because Brad sucks and isn't really willing to work things out. Always says he'll do something, but never does. So as far as the HOA sueing him, I assume I need a lawyer then right? What kind?  You have whatever options are provided for in the association documents. It is perhaps likely that "the association" can sue Brad or even file a lien against his property. That may be somewhat complicated based on Brad apparently having an equal vote in each matter, but it may be possible to act on the association documents since Brad equally lacks the votes to change them. More likely your best move is to find a way to work something out with Brad. And perhaps to rethink this association arrangement.
