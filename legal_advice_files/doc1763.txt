 But of a complicated situation. I was dating a man for a few months. I broke up with him after I discovered that he runs a photography website and blog about his relationships with overweight women. At first when you look at the website, it seems to be from a place of appreciation, however on closer inspection one can clearly see that his motives are much darker. Many of the models (who he also had relations with, many simultaneously) have come forward with claims of revenge porn and claims that he has violated release conditions. On top of that, many are claiming that their releases were signed under duress, saying that he had threatened them. There are a few women who say that he would detain them at his place or residence and would only allow them to leave if they signed. At one point, Buzzfeed Japan was involved in trying to expose him. No photos of me have been posted and I have not signed anything, but he has taken photos of me (just regular photos, not nudes, to my knowledge) although I am suspicious that he may have taken explicit photos of me without my knowledge. I feel very strongly that he is an abuser who uses his power position as a photographer to take advantage of these women. He tells them they will be models and pop idols but it is pretty clear that he uses these promises to convince them to take explicit photos or emotionally abuse them. I have contacted a few of the victims. They have been trying to challenge him for about a year, as far as I know. Their numbers are growing all the time as more women come forward. His defense now is ‘nothing can be proved, and you all signed releases’ What I want to know is, if there are a number of women who corroborate the forced signing of these releases, can the legality of said releases be challenged and how? If any photos taken of me appear, can I have them removed? What can we do?
