So my husband and I need our window to be tinted at our new place of business. Through his job, he gets to know a lot of people. So if he ever needs anything done, he always knows someone who does what he’s looking for. 

He met this guy there, who offered to tint our windows. He works for an actual tinting place but he said he’d do it on the side, for less. 

We made a deal for $700, he asked for $300 upfront, we gave it to him and he got started.
He came in, did a couple windows and said he’d be back that Saturday to finish.

He calls the Friday before, saying his car broke down and if we could pay him the rest of the money upfront to get another car, and he’d see us the next day. 
Saturday comes, he doesn’t show and keeps making other appointments dates to finish and just stops showing up. 
A month passed and we got fed up and we asked him for our money back. He says he’s going on vacation out of the country for 2 months and he can’t give it back because he has bills to pay. 

We know he’s still in town because my husband has him as a friend on Facebook and he’s been tagged in pictures at multiple events around town. 

We have messaged him multiple times, we are friendly but he will just read it and not reply. 

What is our best course of action?  
 Small claims? How would that work? Should we speak to his employer?  Thanks for the advice! Last thing he replied was three weeks ago, saying he’d return $600 after he got back from ‘vacation’. He was supposedly leaving the week before thanksgiving. We know he didn’t ever go anywhere and we’ve seen he’s still around town.  I will have my husband message him what you said. Truly appreciate it.  [deleted]
