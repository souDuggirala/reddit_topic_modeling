 Hi! First time poster, long time lurker. I just recently moved into a new apartment complex back in September. And since we have lived there, only one maintenance issue has been fixed. And it's getting pretty bad now. 1. They have not addressed the foundation issues. It's so bad, I feel like another wet season that comes through, my building will collapse. 2. Ant's are now coming in. So pest control hasn't come by. I work from home, and no one has been by. 3. And I have a laundry list of other issues. What are my options? I feel like the management team is lazy and nothing is getting done. I'm about to have my first child arrive next month, and I don't feel safe.
