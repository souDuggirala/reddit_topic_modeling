I know, I shouldn’t have. But I did. 


I wrote #MeToo on the school bathroom stall. Below it, I wrote, “You too? Leave a tally mark.” I’m not so concerned about getting in trouble for the graffiti itself because the walls are COVERED in it. I’m more concerned - because we’re a school with minors, can the school start an investigation to try and locate me due to the fact that #MeToo is associated with sexual assault.
