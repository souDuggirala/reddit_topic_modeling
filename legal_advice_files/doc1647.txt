 Most of the trust info I am finding just talks about the estate and tax benefits of trusts. I am more interested at this point of my life, protecting assets from the perils of the courtroom rather than my own mortality. Does anyone have any good online resources or book recommendations regarding trusts or other vehicles to become an expert at protecting what I've earned from litigation and divorce? A true visionary and asset to the board. Thank you for your helpful and in-depth response.  To protect your assets from litigation: insurance plus refraining from bad behaviour. To protect your assets from divorce: don't get married.
