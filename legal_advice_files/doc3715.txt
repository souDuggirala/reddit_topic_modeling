 Basically what the title said. I'd be slightly less annoyed if I was at least notified that work was going to be done/scheduled rather than finding random people in my backyard on my security cameras. They also used my hose (again without permission) and left garbage after more-or-less clear cutting everything on the edge of my yard. I basically just want to know if this is allowed and I just have to tolerate being annoyed or if this was out of bounds and I need to file a complaint. Yup, there it is. Whoosh---check your thread title. Pubic workers Like that guy last week who went for a Brazillian and got told to leave. Contact the company and complain about the water and the mess. They have an easement so they donâ€™t have to notify you, but they normally do. Probably a bureaucratic snafu.  Or else what? I appreciate they have a tough job but that doesn't give them a license to potentially damage property and leave garbage... Pubic workers doing trimming should be given the utmost care and courtesy. You don't want them upset with you. They almost certainly have an easement which allows them to conduct reasonable maintenance. In which case they would be allowed to hop a fence.  If they have an easement they don't have to tell you. As to using the hose and leaving garbage, you can file a complaint for that.
