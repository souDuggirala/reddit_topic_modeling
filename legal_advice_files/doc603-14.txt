I get along with my cousins from my dad's side. They have had sleepovers at my house. But I don't like to go to their house. One time when I was 7 I was having a sleepover at their house. When I woke up I lifted my head and I saw my aunt near my feet. She was nibbling on my nails. It felt so weird so I pretended to be asleep. She then got up.

I was going to my cousins house today. And thinking of what happened when I was seven I though it was a dream. Long Story Short, she was licking my toes today and taking pictures of my toes and feet.

I need help what should I do?

Can i file a harassment claim or something? Or should i tell the police? Troll. Removed.  [deleted] NAL but it Sounds like she has a foot fetish. Im curious it this qualifies as sexual assault. My advice is donâ€™t go over there any more
