 I have definitely messed up a little bit here but the whole situation became very stressful and I made a few decisions in attempt to offset that stress which may come back to bite me in the ass now. I have a boat slipped in a marina in San Diego, Ca. I have sold the boat to a new buyer and have sent them the title and filled out a Release of Liability form with the buyer’s name but have not filed a Bill of Sale. The only thing I have stating that the buyer has purchased the boat is an ongoing text message thread where he has agreed to purchasing the boat. My slip rental contract expires at the end of the month. The new owner has not contacted the Marina about moving the boat so the Marina is harassing me about how I intend to proceed with slip fees. Do I just send the Marina the new owners info and tell them their problems are not mine or could I still be held liable for something here? Your advice and comments are deeply appreciated.  [removed] Because you are responsible for the slip. How could the Marina come after me for a boat being kept on their property that I no longer am attached to? If the new owner doesn’t contact them wouldn’t the Marina need to try to get their information? It seems to me that this problem should now be addressed between the Marina and new owner.  Whether the boat is yours or not, you still owe them for the slip if it's in use. You need to remove the boat from the slip (or have it removed) post haste.
