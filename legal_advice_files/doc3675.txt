 Location: United States I was talking with my friends last night and they mentioned that if you buy marijuana in a legal state, you are not allowed to buy any more firearms. Is that true? I can’t imagine someone shooting a person on purpose because they were stoned. Any responses are appreciated! To the ATF update the 4473 question 11, e to cover possessing marijuana. So, any FFL would not be able to sell or transfer you any firearm unless you lie on the form. Private sales may be another issue since they don't need the 4473 but individual states may have a different form for private sales that may cover it as well. Oh yeah you’re right, I forgot there’s a question about marijuana on the form you fill out before they do a background check. I guess I’ll just have to buy from the dispensary under the name of rusty shackleford  mari jane is still on the federal ban listing for substances. during the purchase of a new firearm, you will fill out a FFL form for a validation check. one of those questions asks if you are a drug abuser. its a damned if you do, damned if you dont question. you violate federal policy if you say yes. you lie on a .gov form if you say no. sooner or later the feds will have to deal with it all.
