 I'm just being a paranoid parrot, but I'm curious about this. If I have important business conversations with my client on Slack that would defend me in court, but they delete or edit their message to prove otherwise, how would this work? Does this mean I should avoid communicating with clients on this rich communication tool? Slack has an edit history. Enough said. I don't own it. I think I'm getting a clear answer from this thread. It's an unfortunate one... Thanks! Is this a Slack you own and pay for? If so, you can do a “compliance export”. If you don’t pay, you may be able to get the data via request: “Workspace Owners must contact Slack and apply to export content from private channels and direct/group messages. We will reject applications unless Workspace Owners show in each instance (a) valid legal process, or (b) consent of members, or (c) a requirement or right under applicable laws in order to export data.” -   You could disable that. If something goes to court, you can testify to the authenticity of the messages. If you're running a business, it might be worth running your concerns by an attorney in your state.
