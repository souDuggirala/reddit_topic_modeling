 Hi there, first time posting here. Hope to get some advice with my situation. My wife's car was in a fender bender about a month ago. No liability on our part, she was rear ended at a complete stop. Car goes into shop for repair about 5 days later. I'm told when I drop it off that it will be a 3-4 day repair. OK, no sweat. After a few weeks of follow ups and parts delays etc, I'm now told they found more damage and they think it's totaled. Still waiting on Allstate to confirm this (was supposed to hear back today). I have gap coverage, so I'm OK in that regard. My question really lands on the rental car we've been driving. Allstate is picking up the tab for said rental, but I had to make a choice to insure it at 15 dollars a day. I was told up front this cost would be on me. I'm thinking, OK, 3-4 days.. no big deal. I can handle that. Now it's going on 4 weeks and I'm going to be looking at a roughly 500 dollar bill for this rental for an accident that I had no liability in. I should mention I could have opted to use my insurance for the rental in a transferable setup, but I really didn't want to take the risk of having to throw up my deductible (500 coincidentally) if anything happened. Now I'm realizing I should have done it this way since it looks like I'm going to have to pay about that anyways. Allstate won't pick up this tab, despite my expressing my concerns. My main defense is the time the repair took and how that affected my decision to buy the Enterprise insurance. So, am I screwed here or is there anything I can do to get reimbursed for this? Thanks for any comments. NAL: You could always try going after the other parties insurance for the costs, but due to rental insurance being optional is what is likely going to get it denied. Especially because you could have canceled the rental insurance at any time once it got past 4 days. Youâ€™re better off just paying what you owe now and canceling the additional insurance.
