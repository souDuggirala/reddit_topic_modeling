 I worked for a year and a half as an apprentice electrician. I had accumulated over 70 hours of PTO. They are now refusing to pay this to me because they said I owe them for the money for paying for my schooling. The way I understand indiana law is that they can only deduct things like the cost of schooling if it's in writing and signed. Which it is, but my point to them is that this is not pay and that it is accrued benefits. I do not see in the law where they are allowed to take from my benefits. I'm trying to figure out whether I have any rights to sue or contact the state to file a claim for pto they never paid. I have a link to the indiana site where under deductions it states the laws. www.in.gov/dol/2345.htm Thanks for any help. You left out a pretty key fact. Do you owe them back for tuition? Did you agree to repay tuition as a condition of receiving that financial assistance?   Who owes more? You for your educational costs, or them for the PTO?
