 Hello r/legaladvice I have an important question and I hope I am right in asking here. I have seen the other types of questions from people on here and this feels kind of insignificant, I hope you can help. I am a minor (in high school) and I have a PayPal account linked to my mothers debit card, she allows me to get stuff in exchange for chores and such. I recently sold an iPhone on eBay with my eBay linked to my PayPal, and now PayPal is requesting verification (Photo ID or SSN) before I can take my money. I did not think it through whether it was legal to even have a PayPal account at my age with no real financial connection to myself. Help? How do I get my money? Is there anything I can do. Help would be very greatly appreciated. Well, I set it up in my name a while ago and did not really read into my rights, rushed into it. I have contacted customer support but it looks like I may lose a couple hundred bucks, which is a lot for me. Oh well, I appreciate you commenting. Thank you very much Is the PayPal account in your name or your mother's? If the latter, then she's the one to send over her ID/SSN, and there's no issue there. If it's in your name, how did you open the account in the first place? You would be violating their Terms of Service, and they have every right to shut the account down -- and there's unfortunately not much you can do. As an aside, eBay's minimum age is also 18.
