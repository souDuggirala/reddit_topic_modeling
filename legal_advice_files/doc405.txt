  I believe I signed a stipulated Vehicle Agreement over 7 yrs ago. Shouldn't that have been thrown out by now? Can they still keep my car if I signed this paper over 7 yrs ago? Upon looking in CA Legislative info I found in article 3. 1806.1 "If a person has entered into a stipulated Vehicle release agreement pursuant to paragraph 2, of sub vision D of section 14607.6, the dept shall maintain a record of that fact for 7 yrs from the date the person signed the agreement. A little more background. The original agreement was signed about 8 yrs ago on an old car for someone else that had been driving. Fast forward to present and my current bf was pulled over. In addition to all of this, our registration shows my name OR another partys name whom does not have any type of agreement. Since her name is on there as OR instead of AND, shouldn't she be able to get the car released once the 30 days is up? Tow yard DMV both say yes, but cop says no?  Just interpreting the statute subsection you posted, it sets seven years as the minimum amount of time the record must be kept, but it does not require the record to be destroyed at that point.
