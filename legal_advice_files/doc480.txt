 My SIL is going through initial divorce process with her husband. She has been staying with both of her kids (biological with her and her husband) at her parents, my in laws. Her husband has been out of state with his parents. Before she told her husband she wanted a divorce, he was not interested in calling or seeing either of his children. After she told him, he has pressed the issue that he wants to see his oldest daughter and talk to her on a regular basis. Tonight, he and his parents, took her while visiting and going out for ice cream. The police have been contacted and stated they canâ€™t do anything. What sort of legal avenues can we pursue?  She needs to file for custody. That is not kidnapping, he has the same rights to the children as she does. You said he is out of state, does she live in the state where the kids have been for 6 months? Or did they move more recently? She can file for custody in the jurisdiction where the Children lived for the last 6 months. Your SIL can file for divorce and an agreement as to custody and parenting time. In he absence of a court order, neither parent has any particular obligation to do anything in terms of splitting parenting time.
