 I've recently come into some money, and some friends and I would like to pool our money together to invest. Just us, no outsiders. As I understand it, people who invest in hedge funds must be accredited investors, and the founders of mutual funds must be accredited as well. Is there any way that my friends and I can pool our money together for investment and have the flexibility to purchase options and derivatives, etc., without too much red tape. No outside investment, just us. Thank you so much. It isn't a hedge fund, it is [an investment club](). I would get a lawyer because this is a red tape ball and the state you are in is aggressively regulatory.
