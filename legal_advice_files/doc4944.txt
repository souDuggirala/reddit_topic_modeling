 I am 55. I have only been a therapist for 4 and 1/2 years. I often tell people older than 19, (20, 21 and 22 year olds) that they are way too old for college and that they are messed up in the head if they do not have a career yet(talking about a career, not reg, jobs everyone those ages has). I sometimes mis diagnose people all the time. And it ends up offending some people and they refuse to come back. Why am I not allowed to tell people this stuff? Majority of people I see have depression the normal stuff you see a therapist for, but once I find out they are 20, 21 or 22 and don't have a career yet I find the need to put them down and I just cannot stop doing it. This is throwaway account as I'm needing legal advice and I am serious and not being jokey. Wyoming It sounds like you're just bad at your job and not suited to working with people. This isn't a legal issue, you just need a different career.  Trollolololol, lololol
