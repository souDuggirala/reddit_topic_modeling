  I used to work at a restaurant in Georgia until my boss recently "fired" me. He took away all of my scheduled hours this coming week after a conflict with him a few days ago with the intention of never giving me hours again. This guy has done this to every employee he's ever "fired" just so they can't claim unemployment. I've been working there for 8 years and am going to need income until I find a new job. Is there a way for me to fill for unemployment anyway or is his loophole going to screw me over? Can I sue? How do I get income in the meantime while searching for a new job? Many places dispute UI claims as a matter of course. If the place you were working at folks out their paperwork and doesn't argue, it's a smooth process. If the employer fights it, there will need to be a hearing. Are people really denied UI that often? I thought that advice was usually for disability. Just curious! You can usually file for [unemployment benefits]() if your hours are cut. Your state office will have details. You would need to qualify otherwise, and the benefit will fill in that gap for your wages. The legal term for what your boss has done is "constructive dismissal." File for unemployment and start applying for other jobs. If you're denied benefits (most people are on the first application), appeal. Agree with above. You’ve have been “constructively terminated.” File for unemployment. If he contests, then point out his actions.  Yes, you have been fired. Yes, you can file for unemployment. Your boss is an idiot. This does not magically unqualify you for UI. So file unemployment, your boss did not figure out the one neat trick to defeat the department of labor. There is no loophole. If you're out of work file for unemployment. 't claim unemployment. Yes they can.
