 I got a speeding ticket in November, I had the flu during the court date and genuinely forgot about it. I do not have a single thing on my record whatsoever. This is my first speeding ticket in my life. When I mentioned it to my friends I was told this now means I have a warrant for my arrest. I’m just looking for my next steps so I don’t lose my job. If I get “arrested” while I pay the ticket even for the technicality of it I will be fired from my job. Just looking for any advice anybody is willing to give. Google was not super helpful. It said to “turn myself in” but I feel like that is self incrimination. Thanks in advance! Retain a lawyer and turn yourself into the police. Once you go before a judge explain that you had the flu, etc and hope for the best.  You may have a warrant out for failing to appear. If you go to the courthouse and the traffic window they can look it up. Have your credit /debit card ready because you'll have to pay fines right then and there, and it won't be cheap.  I’m definitely going to call in the morning. By the time I realized my catastrophic mistake it was closed for the day.   “turn myself in” but I feel like that is self incrimination. It's not. This happens fairly often. Call the court and explain what happened and ask about your options. best bet is to go into the police station and pay the ticket.
