 In mid December, a check that was sent as payment was misread by their optical readers and instead of being chased for the face value, they added nearly $20,000 to the amount despite that the amount was properly written out in words. I called them immediately and while it took some time to identify what happened, they admitted fault and said they would reverse the debit in 3-5 business days. That time went by and several calls later, I was still being promised an expedited processing but days turned into weeks. It's now almost the end of the year and that $20k has not been returned to me. This may not seem like a lot of money to some but this is life ruining money for me. My life has been nothing but fear and anxiety. My holidays are completely ruined. Today I got another voicemail responding to mine that they're not sure what happened and that they're looking into it. It's Friday today so I imagine I'm faced with another weekend of anxiety. As far as I know Great Lakes is a third party company that the Dept of Education uses to service their loans. The payments go to the Dept of Education and so I assume they're trying to get this money back from them / The US Treasury. This is however not my problem and it seems fair that this should be handled between them and the Dept of Ed and not drag me through this personal hell. I don't know what else I can do here but air this out here. Im reaching out to the FTC and The Consumer Protection Board but I fear that lodging a complaint wont expedite this nor make up for the month and a half of hell they caused. I cant afford a lawyer to intervene and not sure one would for that amount of money. What are my options?
