 I had a tenant break a toilet and sent in a plumber too repair it because I hate water with a passion. He had to do a full repair on the toilet gaskets and all about four months ago. Just got a call from a tenant and said there was water coming up from the flooring in her bathroom. I found out it was coming from a bolt that attached the toilet from the top to bottom. It's been going on so long there is calcium build up between the cracks. Now having to replace flooring pull trim and damage to cabinets. How liable is he? You’ll most likely have signed away your right for holding the company who did the plumbing liable by signing off on there work when they were there. It’s certainly going to be an uphill battle depending on the size of the company who did the work. You’d also need to determine if it was a bad install job or failure of parts used.
