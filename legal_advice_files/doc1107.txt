 My mother recently died and we discovered that she had a second life insurance policy that she maybe forgot about. I haven't been able to locate the trust document. The beneficiary of the life insurance policy is a revocable living trust from 1993. The insurance company didn't have any info about the trust. I have checked with the original broker who sold mom the policy, but she has moved agencies and didn't remember or have anything about the trust. I've contacted two attorneys who represented my mom during the same time period for a divorce to ask if they know about the trust or maybe referred my mom to someone to have it written. One of them responded to tell me she didn't draft the trust. The financial company managing her assets for the last several years doesn't have any info on it. If we can't find the trust document, what are our options? How would we transfer the money from the trust to her heirs? Can we have the trust revoked because she failed to keep the documentation and never told anyone about it? If the trust is revoked, does it revert to her estate and get distributed per the terms of her will?
