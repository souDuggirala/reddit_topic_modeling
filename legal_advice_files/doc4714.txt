 Hi Reddit, I’ve been put in somewhat of a sketchy situation due to my mother’s guillable decision to hire someone to replace our heat pump without any research. We’re based in Montreal, Canada My mom found this person through someone at her club but he had only done a maintenance check for her friend. He has promised that the whole process would take two days, and after asking for the money in advance my mom has told him that she will pay a portion in intervals (thank god). It’s been 4 days now, and everytime we try to contact him he doesn’t answer his phone and now he has told my mom that he’s been in the emergency all day. Other red flags: - he’s constantly chatting with my mom instead of working, even breaking down and crying to her all night yesterday about his life. - his google reviews are atrocious, as most if not all reviews have been about him taking the money and not doing a good job and then never replying his calls. - the name he gave to us is different than the name stated on his drivers license (which we have a copy of) - his office address is of some residential apartment My mom has stated that he has a permit that he showed her, but at this point there is so much sketchy business going on and we cannot risk losing any more money. What can we do? My mom has signed a contract which I have not seen yet, but the time to have the job completed isn’t on there.
