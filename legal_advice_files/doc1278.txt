 If my PO didn't drug test me on the initial meeting is it likely he won't unless he becomes suspicious. Also, how long after the initial meeting is he likely to show up for a home visit ? He will test you whenever the hell he wants and no one can hazard any sort of a schedule. It is random for a reason.  There is no way for us to answer this without knowing the policies of your PO's office, the charges you are on probation for, your local laws and many other factors that you shouldn't tell us.
