 I just got a citation for possession of marijuana and paraphernalia, and was wondering what to say if and when the judge asks if i have any prior charges. I got in trouble when I was a minor for the same thing and another incident, but those charges were dropped. I guess I dont know for sure if they would still keep record of this somehow. A previous incident shouldn't affect the verdict, no. And for maximum possible penalty purposes (not to say that you would receive this), this should be considered a first offense. So it would most likely still effect the outcome of of this case? Prior convictions = no, prior charges = yes with explanation that charges were dropped, prior arrests = yes (if true) with explanation that charges were dropped.
