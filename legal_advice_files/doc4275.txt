 Hello reddit! In this specific case, the step-parent is a US citizen, married to the mother of the child (mother is a permanent resident). Child falls into second preference, 2B category. Who can fill the form in this scenario? Just the biological mother or the step-father as well? Thanks! The person with the parent/child relationship files the petition. Step relationships aren't recognized for immigration purposes unless a legal adoption happens (and an adoption would have to happen before 16 or 18th birthday). So the mother should file. If she later naturalizes, the petition can be converted to the appropriate category while retaining the same date.
