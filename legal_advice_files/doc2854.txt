 Today at the beginning of the my math class I was bouncing a racquetball out of boredom. My teacher said “hey let me see that ball”, as he wanted to bounce it himself. After throwing the ball I remembered that on the ball I had written “friends=star of david” and “goot=sexy” with goot being a nickname for another student (my teacher is not aware of this). He noticed these statements on the ball and sent it down to our discipline office. Was this allowed? Well it wasn’t illegal. You were not incriminated. Yes
