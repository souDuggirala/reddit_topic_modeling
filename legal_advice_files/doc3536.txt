 My girlfriend lives in one of her mother's apartments in Dusseldorf, Germany, and a few days ago, 3 of 6 apartment units in our complex signed a document forcing us to muzzle our dog. My girlfriend's mother was one of them. So far, our dog hasn't bit anyone, but there was an incident that precipitated this. A few months ago, a neighbor asked to pet my dog. I said no, but she did it anyways. I asked her to stop; but she reached in again and this time my dog growled at her. This whole situation seems fishy to me, and I'd rather not muzzle my dog every time I have to take him for a walk. He hates it and it just seems cruel and unnecessary. Why is it even socially acceptable to put your hands on other people's pets without permission? It's happened so many times, but there's never been an incident where someone's been bitten. Am I the one being crazy here? What if we don't comply with the order and walk him unmuzzled anyways? What does it say on this document in summary? Normally no you wouldnâ€™t be allowed to do this, since you warned the person petting your animal multiple times not to pet it Please review the [Landlord Tenant Questions]() section of the /r/LegalAdvice Wiki for common questions and answers regarding landlord tenant issues.
