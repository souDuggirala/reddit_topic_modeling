 So this might take a minute. I am pretty sure it's not a giant thing but I would at least like people to be aware. About 5 months ago I decided to quit watching Hulu and switch to Netflix. I uninstalled the app and ironically lost my debit card around the same time. I went online with the email account I thought I had used to create my Hulu account and could not find any account. So I called Hulu about a 3 months later after realizing they were still charging me. The lady on the phone was really nice and had no problem refunding me for the 3 months I was charged. My first question was how did they get the card information seeing as I never updated it with Hulu. My Girlfriend had started her own account on our Xbox with the app redownladed and Hulu snatched my card information and had kept charging me with the updated Xbox information. The real kicker here is the Hulu employee informed me that I have actually had a second Hulu account that was also being charged since 2017! I was charged twice a month, once for an inactive account and once for an active account for years! She told me Hulu policy is only able to refund up to six months. My questions here are, how many people are being charged a month without their knowledge? Is there anyway to get the rest back? Why don't they just stop charging inactive accounts? I have already contacted my bank, there is an investigation pending and I was issued two temporary credits; 192$ for the Hulu payments and 132$ for "minimum balance payments reversed".  You may complain to Hulu. They didn't fetch payment info, you gave it to them. It's not their fault you didn't cancel a subscription and never check your bank statements. Feel free to call some law firms to see if they want to start a class action lawsuit, but don't be surprised when they laugh and hang up.
