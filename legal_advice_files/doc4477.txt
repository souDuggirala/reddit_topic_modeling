 My wife and I rent the first floor of a duplex in MA. We were just told by one of our neighbors that woman who lives above us's adult son who lives with her is a level 2 sex offender. Our landlord did not inform us of this at the time of signing our lease. He's been convicted multiple times of lewd and lascivious conduct, including showing his genitals in public and peeping into dorm rooms at a local women's college that my wife happened to attend. We're both pretty unhappy about this, I've called city hall as well as the state AG's office and they said they're not sure about the notification requirements. Do we have any justification to break our lease over this at this point? We have 7 months to go, and my wife is particularly concerned about this. Thank you! No law in Massachusetts requires a landlord to disclose a person's sex offender status. And your landlord has not breached any term of your lease, so you cannot break the lease without incurring the penalties described in it for an early lease break. Does your lease state that your landlord has to inform you of any sex offenders that reside on property? I would wager no. While your concerns aren't undue, and wanting to move is reasonable, sex offenders have to live places and the majority of them don't have to inform neighbors. You don't have cause to break your lease without penalty.  That's kind of what I figured. Thanks! The landlord has no requirement to notify you, so if you want to break the lease, you'll have to negotiate with him and pay whatever fee/penalty he requires. Sorry.
