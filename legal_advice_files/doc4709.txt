 Business im not nameing unless someone asks is bringing on a contraveral service and thier landlord is against that practice and is refusing to renew their lease so i am wondering is that legal  I might add that this is provided the lease does not include a renewal option provision for the Tenant. In other words, the Landlord may not prevent you from exercising an option he has already agreed to. Such things are very common in commercial leases.  thanks for the answer Yes, a commercial landlord can generally decide who they will and will not do business with or continue to do business with.  Yes, it’s legal. They aren’t renewing based on race, gender, a protected class.
