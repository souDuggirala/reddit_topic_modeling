 Hey guys, So I received a court summons today over some unpaid debt that I had toward my University; about $1k that wasn't covered by my financial aid at the time. I thought I could just pile it on the the tens of thousands of dollars I'm already in debt with, but I suppose not and I digress. I'm still a teenager, and I'm not really sure what this court situation would look like. Is this an open and shut case of the university getting their money back (garnishing my wages, collection agencies etc)? Do I need to delete Facebook and lawyer up? Is there any way I can talk to my university about an installment plan or something? Just not really sure what to expect, so some kind of explanation would be helpful! Note: I work directly for my Uni and I am a student as well, if that makes any difference.  The usual course of events for these kinds of cases is that the creditor will file a summons and complaint against the debtor; move for a default judgment when the debtor does not answer or appear; obtain a default judgment against the debtor; and then begin the execution process (which can include liens on property and wage garnishment depending on the jurisdiction). We don't know enough about your situation to gauge whether you could successfully fend off a judgment in court. Usually, many creditors will try to work with you on doing an installment plan because some money is usually better than nothing if the defendant is uncollectible. First, try to work something out with the creditor, and if that fails, obtain a low-cost consult with an attorney who can give you some advice. If you can't hire an attorney or pay for a consult, absolutely appear for every single court hearing and explain your situation to the judge. You may or may not defeat liability, but, in many cases, the creditor's attorney can settle with you on the spot in lieu of a judgment.
