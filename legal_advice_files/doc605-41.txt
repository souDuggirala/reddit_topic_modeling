I was involved in a traffic accident one month ago where I was at fault. My insurance is covering all damage costs for both parties. I received a letter from my insurance with a copy of a letter sent through fax. It states the form must be returned to their office within 10 days and to notify them if I'm unable to meet this deadline.

The actual form itself asks me to input my insurance policies, umbrella and excess insurance, as well as household members.
I plan on calling my insurance company to understand the situation more, but in the meanwhile it would be helpful if anyone knows what this is.  They are trying to see if they can spread the load.    It's fairly normal, and very likely a condition of your coverage to cooperate.
