 In California. I was wondering if my HOA is under the jurisdiction of the Fair Housing Act for providing handicapped parking? It is comprised of about 60 detached townhouses built in the late 80's. There's two private roads and parking is very limited, with only 11 or so spaces on each street. We're given parking permits but they aren't enforced and often there are houses that let their guests park without a second permit. I have a neurological disease which causes waxing and waning severe fatigue. I have a handicapped placard but there are no designated handicapped spots. It is getting to the point where I'm afraid to leave my house to go run errands or go to the doctor because there's no where to park when I get back. If I request that they stripe a handicapped space, are they obligated to do so under the Fair Housing Act? They are the type of HOA to not care about this sort of issue unless there's a law for it. Check your bylaws and see if you have a parking space that is defined under limited common element. Meaning that it's a space owned by the HOA but is designated for a certain unit.  I work at a property management company and you can definitely call them to see who the patrol vendor is and how you can get them to do their job. If you see vehicles parked without proper permits you are within your rights as a homeowner to have the vehicle towed per the CC Rs of the community. Also, your board of directors meets regularly, usually monthly or quarterly, go to the next meeting and bring the issue up. This is what HOAs are for! Yes they have to comply with the FHA and yes they have to provide you a parking space near your home even if the parking is first come, first serve. Here is a DOJ guide that may be helpful. If they refuse to comply when you request the assigned parking space, consult with an attorney.
