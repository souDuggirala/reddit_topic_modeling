 If swim is a victim of a crime, in this case ID theft and credit fraud and the suspect tells law enforcement of the victim "using drugs" can law enforcement then search the victims property? Or is all just "hear say" ? If the "suspect" witnessed swim using drugs then it's not hearsay.  Passive tone is so fucking annoying and it accomplishes nothing at all. Using "SWIM" isn't one weird trick to stop you from incriminating yourself. No, its unlikely that the cops will search your property because a criminal told them to.  Hearsay is an evidentiary rule which governs whether certain statements will be admissible at trial. Police officers can rely on hearsay to investigate.
