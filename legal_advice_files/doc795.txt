 I work delivery driving, my phone and float were stolen at one point a while back. There is nothing in the contract I signed that states I have to pay for stolen goods and I'm pretty sure workphones are a boss's responsibility. I will stick to the story that the car was locked as I have a habit of pressing the dongle before putting my keys in my pants pocket. Now boss is telling me that I owe him $600 for a new phone, and took $100 already out of my paycheck. All the while I'm moving out of home into a new place in Perth for the first time so I need all the money that I was expecting to get to pay bond etc. I get the feeling that he's just preying on me because I'm young (18) and he thinks I won't do anything about it. How should I proceed? Most places do not allow deductions from your pay like that without prior authorization in writing. If that is the case, you could file a claim with your state's labor department.  If itâ€™s not in your contract, you could go after him for illegal docking of pay Work phones and computers have always been my responsibility. Meaning if I lost or damaged them I was paying for them. They are property of my employer but I am responsible for taking care of them
