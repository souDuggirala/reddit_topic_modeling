 Hello Legal Advice, Sorry for the somewhat new account as this is my throwaway and people in real life know my Reddit account. So Current Situation is that I lost my job about 7 months ago in an area where there aren't a ton of jobs that do that. I lost my job because the company was downsizing and i just happened to be one of the 40 people they let go. I got some severance and was able to collect unemployment so it wasn't that big of a deal. However, I did have a lot of credit card debt that I was trying to pay off due to being an idiot when I was younger and didn't fully understand what credit cards were or how they worked. (yes i realize now how stupid that was but I was a young and dumb kid that didn't have anyone to explain how they worked). I contacted both of my credit card companies and let them know that I would not be able to make payments towards the cards due to me losing my job and both companies basically said that isn't not our problem you still own us X amount of dollars a month. I accepted this answer because I did spend their money and I do owe them that. However 2 months ago I had to stop paying them because my severance ran out between all my bills and expenses and now i don't know what to do with me getting a notice in the mail saying that I am in default and if I don't pay them will use there legal rights to do something. I don't have anything worth of value to sell and am currently working a retail job just to put food on the table and keep up on my rent, and please don't recommend me to personal finance or anything like that as I currently don't have anything worth value to sell to pay bills. How screwed am I with this or what are the best options for me to do from a legal side and what are my options that I should consider? Don't ignore it. Bankruptcy may be an option depending on the amount due.
