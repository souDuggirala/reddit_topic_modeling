 (US) Last night on a date my car slid into a tree at about 10 mph(hit the thick lower branches, not the actual trunk) and I thought me and my date were fine. Today she texted me saying she feels like she has whiplash because her neck and back hurt. I haven’t felt a thing. When I said she should go see a doctor(and offered to pay) she said that it’s illegal for her to use her insurance since she was injured while I was driving. Is this true? If so, what are my best options? It's not illegal but cars insurance is usually primary and health secondary. Her health insurance will ask what caused the injury and likely subro against your auto insurance I believe she should use her medical insurance and you (or your car insurance) would legally be liable for the remaining medical bills. I work for an auto insurance company.
