 So, with the recent legalization of cannabis in canada, it has left the oil and gas industry in a bit of a pickle. My company Decided not to make any changes to the determination of a violation of our drug and alcohol policy. Basically we are sticking with the 50 NG/ML cutoff for THC in our drug tests. We dont test other than pre employment and post incident and our HSE guy told us unofficially that they dont REALLY care, just dont get caught. Now non of us want to be impaired at work, but the problem is that the urine test detects non active metabolites for anywhere from 2 days to months depending on a few factors. The general opinion is that no companies will change their policies until someone is dismissed for using cannabis on their days off. It seems likely that someone will take a dismissal based on cannabis use to court at some point, based off the number of users and their incomes. I was just wondering reddits opinion on what it will take for a meaningful change to cannabis use policy in the industry or how soon it will happen.
