 We just got married in NJ, do we just go to the social security office? Or is there another form to fill out ? Thank you  You take your marriage certificate (original or certified copy, not photocopy) and ID to your local social security office. There is a social security card replacement form, it depends on the office they might have you fill it out might not. They will give you a receipt. You call your local DMV up and tell them you have gone to Social Security for name change and have your receipt. They might tell you to wait for the Social Security card in the mail or you can go to DMV with the receipt and all proofs and get a new ID in your new name. Then you let your banks and post office know your name has changed.  Take your official marriage certificate to the social security office to get a new social security card. After that you can get a new license. After that update all the other things. Don't forget tax withholdings with your employer, beneficiaries, etc. Congratulations! Not a lawyer, just married a woman once Soc sec will accept any change but that won't be a legal name change. That's through the state govt When you fill out your wedding license forms, you add your new name. That is BEFORE you get married, as you canâ€™t marry without a license. At this point, you would have to have your legal name changed.
