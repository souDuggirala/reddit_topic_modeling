 As the title mentioned, I purchased a 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid and sort of regret the purchase. If I refuse to sign the rest of the contract, are there any ramifications? Can I get my deposit back from the car? Those are probably spelled out in the contract, but is the contract even valid without my complete signatures? Basically, can I void the entire contract by refusing to sign the rest of the contract? Thanks!  I mean you can ask the dealership to take back the car and void the sale, but they might not be under any legal obligation to do so.  Some states offer a cooling off period. I think like 3 days. See if your state has such a law.  I kind of figured I'd be stuck, but figured it wouldn't hurt to ask. Thanks! Fair point, thanks! You need a lawyer to give you advice, without seeing the contract and what you did sign, no one can tell. I highly doubt you will be able to get out of this without legal help. Car dealer sure isn't going to just roll right over and take it back. Depends what you forgot to sign. Certainly by taking delivery of the car you indicated your clear intention to buy the car.
