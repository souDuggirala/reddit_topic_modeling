 So to include my spouse on my renter's insurance is free, but to include a significant other it costs a fee per month. We aren't married but on our apartment papers she is listed as my spouse, so can I include her on the renter's as my spouse? Doing some research, apparently Section 2.401 allows common law marriage to be a valid and legal way to marry without formalities. My documents and lease label us as Spouses so I assumed that when filing insurance and such for the complex I need to keep it consistent and also list her as my spouse. Yes tell them they have labeled you incorrectly and ask them what they typically label two people sharing an apartment who are not married. Okay I get it. My complex labels us as spouse , should I tell them to take it off? They have no option of roommate or S/O If your intent is to declare yourself common law married then yes you can represent this person as your spouse. But realize that from this point forward, you are legally married for almost all respects and purposes. Texas is a community property state so from this point forward any assets you or she acquires are considered marital property. You will need to file your taxes as a married couple and you will need to file for divorce should you choose to part.
