 Is it illegal for my teacher to put a camera in our class room to try to catch people cheating and can keep us back for her chitchating to another teacher ( I live in Ontario Canada) A district putting up a security camera is different than a school unilaterally doing it. Ontario has very strong privacy legislation applying to government bodies (which includes public school boards) and as a result, school districts in that province pass strong privacy policies to ensure compliance. Teachers have to be VERY careful to comply with these policies or risk discipline. "Almost certainly" is strong language here. I'd go with "almost certainly not," in fact. A lot of schools have students sign a lot of waivers every year, and a lot of those waivers are for filming. It's why schools can take photos of their classes for promotional material and yearbooks without explicit permission from parents. Also security cameras are clearly legal in schools, because a lot of schools have them everywhere. Privacy restrictions are much more stringent with minors.  Maybe not illegal, but almost certainly a violation of school or district policy. Talk to the school administration.  Almost certainly. Yes, so long as she is not publishing the results with your face shown (without your permission assumedly)
