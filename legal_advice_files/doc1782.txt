 I was watching an Episode of This is Us (Season 1, Episode 8, the thanksgiving episode) and there is a scene where Mandy Moore (mother, b. 1984) is lying next to her son (Lonnie Chavis b. 2007). They are all in bed and the mother kisses her son. Why is that not considered sexual interference with a minor?  I don't watch that show. Where did she kiss him?
