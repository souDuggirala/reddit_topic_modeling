 I recently dropped out of college to start my career and had to put in a FERPA request for all of my information to be given to me. I made that request on November 1st and it is now December 16th. And “As per 34 CFR Sec. 99.10(b), these records must be made available for my inspection within 45 days of this request.” So they are about to exceed the legal limit of time to send me my information. Where should I go from here? Didn’t the school break the law? Thank you in advance for any help.  That's not a felony. You would just report the violation.  Any violation of FERPA would be civil penalty. A felony is a criminal penalty.  You can file a FERPA complaint.
