 Missouri I responded to an add seeking a donor kidney, was tested, was enough of a match to move ahead with the surgery. The surgery is scheduled in two days. I just found out my nephew needs a kidney and I am the closest match to donate after his father who has a preexisting condition and would likely not survive the surgery. Am I legally obligated to donate the kidney to the first person I promised it to/will I owe them any restitution if I back out at the last minute? Is there anything binding me to my commitment to the first person over my nephew?  Nope, you are not ever legally required to give up one of your organs to someone. You can’t demand the organ back after it’s been popped out, but you will not be forced to relinquish your vital organ to someone else for any reason. You can withdraw consent to donate an organ at any point before the actual organ removal.
