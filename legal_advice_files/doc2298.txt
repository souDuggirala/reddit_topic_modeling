 Hey r/legaladvice, I really need some help right now. I have multiple reasons to believe that one of my friends is being abused to the point that they’d commit suicide. Here’s what I know: -He just turned sixteen. -He’s not allowed to be emancipated. -Starting January 1st, he’s not been allowed to eat or go online for the entirety of the month due to religious purposes. (His family is Christian but I’ve been raised Christian, and I don’t believe this is found anywhere in any sect.) -He might be abused physically and mentally. -He tried to sneak away one night (for reasons I don’t know) and got sent to a psychiatric ward as punishment. -Despite the above, he is not allowed to be put on any sort of medications (Anti-depressants included) -He wants to be a trap (he’s straight) and because of this he’s being sent to a military academy starting tomorrow. -He’s tried to commit suicide once (and was sent to the same psych ward) and from one of his recent messages, I think he’ll try again tonight (I live in EST) I don’t want anything bad to happen to him but I’m not sure what I can do (I’m 17, can’t drive) but I can’t just sit by and let it continue. Help! Have them report this to a counselor or teacher, specifically one they trust if possible. Have them say that as a mandated reporter they know they're required to report abuse, and as a mandated reporter they need them to call CPS because his parents are denying him basic necessities (food, please make sure he explains the food thing) and please absolutely also notify the proper authorities if you believe he's going to attempt suicide. I know this is off topic, but actually trap refers specifically to a male individual, which may or may not identify as female, who enjoys dressing up as a woman and engaging in sexual activities pretending to be one. They are called Traps because even though they may look like a woman, they are actually male, hence them being referred to as "Trap", as in trapping someone in an unexpected situation. They call themselves a trap and are not transgender, and he has made it clear to me that I’m allowed to use it. I’m mostly concerned about the health and safety of my friend. 1) Report this to a teacher or guidance counselor, they can contact DCF or CPS. 2) If your friend is trans, calling her a “trap” is a horrible way to be a friend to her. It’s like a white person calling a Black person the N-word. The only exception is if she claims that word for herself, and says that others can use it for her too. [Here’s some tips from GLAAD]() on how to support transgender people, and [here’s a guide to terms]() - note that the opposite of trans is cis, trans people can be either straight or gay.  Being 17, you should talk to a trusted adult immediately about the situation. They can call CPS or even request police do a wellness check if you're really afraid that the friend will attempt suicide tonight. They need to know that the parents are potentially abusive so that they do not exacerbate the situation. He calls himself a trap, so I do too. I’m mostly not concerned with those details though, I’m concerned about his health and safety. so he just wants to be femme-presenting? why describe it with a derogatory slur? I don't either, but I've seen my share of screen shots, lol. Well, that's more than I knew. 😂 But I don't hang out on 4chan. No, I technically mean trap. This was the best definition I could find for trap: “An anime trap is a boy who looks so convincingly like a female, that by the time you realize you have made a mistake, it's already too late. Transversely, a 'Reverse Trap' refers to a girl who looks very convincingly male.” I know trap is something 4chan kiddies call trans people, but wasn't sure if that's what OP meant.  Trap means crossdresser essentially. I suspect "trap" was an autocorrect for "trans".  Call CPS.
