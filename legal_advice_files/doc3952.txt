 Had like $400 taken by some kid named "dope boi" who ordered a bunch of synthetic drugs online to an address in NY while I live in TX. They're trying to get the merchant, an online drug dealer, to credit them the money. I think I see how that will turn out. They've had to extend the investigation, but here's my question: \[Here\]([]()), it says that if they do that, they'll extend a credit if you submit the request in writing, and thankfully I read this before I disputed over the phone and just mailed them the thing at a cost of about $8, for the tracking/insurance as a precaution. So, this little tidbit I linked isn't in the main cardholder's agreement, I guess, as the url says that it's just a policy. Is this still legally enforceable? I know that these cards are terrible, but I use them for small online purchases instead of using my bank's debit online. I know that they say to use CCs online rather than any sort of debit because of the increased consumer protections, but I don't do credit cards because they are evil. I wouldn't even bank if I could help it and just be a Ron Swanson who buries gold. I like to buy things online, though. I know that the amount is pretty small, too. BUT, I'm just sick and tired of of corporate evil, and am in a position to fight for this, for my own entertainment/satisfaction more than any dollar amount, and also to stick it to them for more than the value of what they're trying to take from me. I'm one of those bitcoin 30 year old retirees, and have nothing but time and a burning hatred for bureaucracy inspired by people like this "bank" trying to get my money. Would I have a case, here, do you think?
