 I live in NSW, Australia. I have a recording of my husband admitting to sexually assaulting me. I’ve gone to the police to lay a charge. If the police decide for whatever reason not to proceed (it’s been several months), can I share the recording or will I be breaking any laws?  That's good to hear, good luck with everything! Thanks for this - I’ve discussed the legality of the recording with this act specifically in mind with my solicitor. It’s believed to have been obtained legally. I would still like to share it with my family and those close to me so I can discuss the events and their impact on me. I’ll wait to see what the outcomes of the investigation is.  Part 2 of the act (regulations of installations use and maintenance of surveillance devices. You can read more here.  I have engaged a criminal solicitor and given them the recording. I haven’t had this conversation with them yet, but it seems unreasonable that I can’t share this with my family or those close to me. Just out of interest, what law would I be breaking? Obviously as long as there is an ongoing investigation then I’d never do anything to jeopardise it. But if nothing comes of this then I would like to be heard.  You are going to need a lawyer. if it is a conversation you guys had and he just says he assaulted you then no you can not share. If it is verbally heard that you are being assaulted and very obvious that you are being hurt then yes. Either way You need a lawyer.
