 Is my mom in trouble? Can she get her child taxes if she gives back the money?  I appreciate it!  Ok so my dad claimed me as well as I claimed myself one year. I had to prove I paid for half of my living. I was able to prove I paid my rent and my car payment and my car insurance and had proof of me buying my own gas and groceries. We both sent in our taxes and we both got money for me. Well we both got a letter from the irs telling us that one of us needed to fix it. I did not since I had proof. My dad has to amend and pay back the money. If you want to do the right thing I would call and set up an appointment with a tax preparer to get the questions answered. Hope this helps... I would wait for your sister to file her amended return and have it accepted. Then your mother can file as she otherwise would have. After speaking with her, she hasn’t filed them yet, but put her on there. Plans to actually file next weekend  I'm confused. Has your mother already filed her taxes or not? Too bad I’m on mobile, noob  Okay, thank you. And do you know if my mom would be able to claim her and get her child taxes after she files an amended return?  Your sister will need to file an amended return reflecting that she is someone's dependent, and pay any difference in taxes.
