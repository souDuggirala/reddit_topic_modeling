 Hello All. I recently was employed under a contract with a staffing agency in Texas (I reside in Massachusetts) and the company I was contracting for is world wide but the office I was directed to was in north shore mass. I signed my contracts and started working. My mass company wrote to me that my contract was extending to March 2019 and then 6-12mo after that for a long term contract position. I was told I would have to commute into Boston to their new office. I bought $300 worth of rail And subway fare. The following Monday (last week) I arrived and the security desk said I didn’t exist in the system, which was odd. Finally reaching up to the next floor, my supervisor told me I had to wait in the cafe for a few hours. She came out and pulled me into a office with HR, and my staffing agency supervisors. She said I was terminated due to “budget cuts” and it was immediately effective. She left with haste, and HR said I needed to give back all assets immediately- like being pushed out with verbal force. I left peacefully. I’ve requested signed contracts from my staffing agency (Texas) 3x now and they will not return my calls or respond to my emails. Same with HR at the Boston location - one associate said I need to stop harassing them or they will get law enforcement involved. According to Texas law, employers aren’t required by law to send copies of contracts. In Massachusetts they are required upon request. I’m really trying to figure out if I can pursue misinterpretation (fraud?), and being reimbursed for my commuter fare. They are making this a bigger hassle than it needs to be. If I do get lawyers involved, do they go after the staffing agency or the main corporate company? Is this a case worth pursuing? I have to move away from Massachusetts because I can’t afford living here and my contract was immediately terminated.
