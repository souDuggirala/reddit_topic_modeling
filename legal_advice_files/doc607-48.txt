Hi, I feel like it's worth noting I'm in the UK in case any laws around this are different in other countries.

A couple of weeks before I left school at 18, my 50-something teacher started showing a social interest in me. He was cool, and a lot of people's favourite teacher (including mine), so I didn't think it was weird - I was pleased actually, that he said he wanted to keep in touch with me when I left school.

He got ahold of my number and sent me a series of flirtatious texts, the day before my last day of school. I was newly single and didn't see the harm at the time, I thought he was fairly attractive in an older sort of way.

After I left school, we became extremely close. However, the relationship got pretty inappropriate. I started depending on it, and the feelings involved got pretty intense.

We never had physical sexual contact, but he did pressure me to send underwear photos, and he sent me some. One time he exposed his penis on Skype (I was away from the screen, and in my shock pretended I hadn't seen it). 

Also one time when I saw him, we hugged and he started grinding against me and guided my hand to touch his crotch through his trousers (and told me to put my hand in his trousers, which I didn't, I ended up running out of the room and leaving straight away actually). 

This all happened less than a year after I left school.

My question is, is any of this illegal? Or just immoral? 

(Please be kind in your replies, I'm pretty scarred by the whole thing and know my behaviour was stupid. I was an idiot at 18.) /r/legaladviceUK
