 Some background information: I am an engineering student with a 2.5 GPA. There was one internship that required a 3.0 and above. Being dumb and desperate I lied on my application and changed my GPA when they asked for an unofficial transcript I changed it. I went to a series of interviews and did really well. I get the job after two-three weeks of waiting. Should I just take it and pretend like nothing happened? It is not uncommon got companies to verify your resume AFTER you are hired and in the position for a few months. I've had this happen to myself and people that work for me. Even if you got the job, you could still be terminated for cause. Its fraud. Bail on the job and try a new company without lying.   lieing on a job application is not fraud. But is grounds for termination IF they find out.  Walk away form this one. Exaggerating on a resume is one thing, fraud will follow you though. I’m in accounting and finance and I realized that I was worth a lot more honest than I would be otherwise a long time ago. I cannot overstate how well this mentality has served me thus far in my career. Don’t start your career with a black mark of this magnitude.  You can be fired at any time for cause, meaning no unemployment. If you attest you are trained for something and your training file includes your resume, then you could be committing fraud either as a tort (the company can sue you) or a crime, depending on the circumstances. You should decline. Congratulations. You committed fraud. You are also an idiot.  Fraud. The word you're looking for is "fraud." You are safest declining the job and not repeating in the future. Just hope they don’t ask for an official transcript. If they do, you’re toast.
