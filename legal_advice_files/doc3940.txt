 I recently was let go at my position as a billing clerk for a small eldercare company in the state of Maine. I questioned the legality of their procedures when it came to billing, and gave some criticisms they were not fond of. I’m trying to figure out of what they were doing was illegal, or simply unethical. Their billing process is very haphazard. We were consistently following up on billing from 2017 and prior due to the billing manager having fallen behind in the past. Upon discovering past due bills, eldercare services were immediately suspended before any attempt to notify the consumer or collect debt. I had a very large ethical dilemma with this, as some of these elderly consumers needed the help daily simply to get by in life. I suggested they should be attempting debt collection first. At the very least they should have been contacting the consumer to request payment and let them know if payment was not received their services would be suspended. We had a client who had his coverage through MaineCare fail for a week, causing a bill to decline. Without any further research, his services with our company were terminated and within a day I was receiving distraught calls from his caseworkers pleading with our company to re-suspend services. Ultimately it was a glitch in the system and his billing shouldn’t have declined in the first place. I realize I likely have a case for wrongful termination, though Maine is an at-will state so I can’t be sure. What I’m truly curious about is if their practices are worth reporting to the state, or if the above mentioned circumstances are legal activity after all.
