 7 years ago, my Grandmother's Mother passed away while my side of the family were on holiday. My Nan had been promised all of her Mothers jewellery (she still has a copy of this letter). Her two Brothers were able to hide this Jewellery, stating it had been stored, never to be seen again. Recent family events have made me want to chase these items (value of over $50,000) Is it possible to do this? Your grandmother would likely still be able to go after these. You could help her but she must be the plaintiff in any legal action. Were these willed to her? A letter would probably not override any will. Bad news for you: the same type of people who would hide jewelry to keep it from whom their mother wanted it to go to are the same type of people who would sell it for money. The jewelry is likely long long gone.
