 Unsure whether this belongs here but I have nowhere else (to my knowledge) to ask this question. Two years ago I had some health problems and went to see a specialist. After getting scoped, I was told they would contact me with results and never did. After hearing nothing for months a bill comes in the mail from the surgery center showing I have an outstanding balance. Pissed off, I never responded to their messages. I thought about contacting them and try to have the specialist foot the bill because I never got my results. I never did because I was afraid that they would strong arm me and force me to pay for a service that never was fully completed. Now two years later there is a hit on my credit history and knocked my score lower than I’m comfortable. Is there any action I can take to have this removed of my history? If not can I force the specialist to pay for it considering I never received my results? I am 22M in college and have never faced a situation like this. I can clarify or answer further questions if needed. Thanks in advance! That sounds frustrating. Have you tried calling them again? That's probably your best course of action at this point. I called them about the results and they kept saying “they were waiting for them to come in.” I called twice. Then Uni started and was bogged down with classes, homework, etc. I was unsure whether to post here or personal finance. [removed] What does bill say you're being charged for? If it's the visit and/or any tests you received, you probably owe the money because services were rendered. You can call the specialist and ask for the results - you probably should have done that to begin with, but hindsight is 20/20. The bill was likely sent to a collections agency. It's possible that /r/personalfinance might be able to help more with this, but I'm not sure. Doesn't really seem like a legal issue at this point.
