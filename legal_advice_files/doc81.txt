 For the last year I had been renting out the basement in a home in DC. When I first moved in it was to take over a sublet, which I then signed on to the house lease a couple months later, ending August 30, 2019. The fees for moving in were first months rent, security deposit matching one months rent, and a non-refundable pet deposit, all paid to the 'head-tenant' identified by the landlord. I should also note that my rent was only a portion of the total rent for the house. I notified the landlord 30 days out of my intention to not re-sign, then notified them again on my plans to finish moving my things out about a week before my lease ended and that I planned to hand the keys over to the new tenant then. I did not hear anything back, moved forward with moving out, and passed the keys on to which I notified the landlord immediately afterwards. Now that the end of the month has rolled around, I reached out to the landlord to ask how I can expect to receive the security deposit. Here's where my issue starts. The landlord notified me that the deposit was entirely handled by the head-tenant and that they don't have any documentation of receiving a security deposit. They sent me a copy of the lease where the line for where the security deposit amount should be listed is blank and said I would need to take it up with the head-tenant. I reviewed my documentation and confirmed that the lease did not have the security deposit amount listed, but I do have the sublease showing the full-house deposit and that I would be reimbursed for my portion. I also have my venmo and bank history confirming my payment to the head-tenant of the security and pet deposits, of which the landlord has confirmed they received the pet deposit. Now I'm trying to get a hold of the past and current head-tenant to try to work something out, but wanted to see what my possibilities were in getting that money back through court if need be.
