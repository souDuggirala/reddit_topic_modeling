 If you were to hypothetically decrypt the beale ciphers would you actually be entitled to any of the treasure found?  The beale cipher (the one publicly decoded) states clearly that its in the state of Virginia. The county laws could differ though, right?  Depends on where you find the treasure. Laws vary significantly from locale to locale. Sometimes it has to be remitted to the controlling state, other times the owner of the property is entitled to it, and in some places the treasure hunter may have rights to it. Too hypothetical to give a definitive answer.
