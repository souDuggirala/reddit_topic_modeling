 Hi, I recently won a small claims case in full (more than a month ago). I haven't been able to collect the money yet (I've contacted the Sheriff and filled out the forms). Today I got a notice that they (the defendant in the previous case) are suing me in the small claims now for something that is total bs. Is it possible to get a small claims case dismissed if I provide evidence that it is in retaliation and it is without merit? I'd prefer not to take time off work again to go to court Thanks!
