 Hello everyone. I am currently living in California, and for the past few years have been staying living with a different family than my biological family, as my biological family has proven to be dishonest with me. I want to become officially adopted, but I was wondering what the legal consequences of it were, namely if I would have to use my "new" parents finances for purposes of FAFSA. Thank you and Happy Holidys. Yes and no. You are under no obligation to tell them, but you lose all legal relationship to them and the rest of your family. Your siblings are no longer your siblings, grandparents, cousins and so on. You are not part of intestacy succession if they pass away and not entitled to inherit-- even if you mislead them into believing they are your legal parents and it is discovered, your siblings or other heirs can challenge the will on that fact. You can not be next of kin in emergency for your current family members, and they can not act as yours. You do not get both "I want to disown my parents legally, but want to have a normal relationship with them and the rest of my family, too." One or the other. Adoption is a big deal, especially in adulthood. You can not reverse it unless you have your parents adopt you again. You become a legal stranger to everyone you've known your whole life. And you have chosen a reason that makes you sound like a petulant child and not at all like an adult.  Would I ever have to tell my biological parents that they're no longer "my parents"? I really don't want to have any arguments  Yes, you'd use your new parents' FAFSA info.
