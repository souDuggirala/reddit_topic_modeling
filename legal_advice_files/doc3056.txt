 Job asked for volunteers and of course not many came forward. Today I found out because people did not volunteered they are making it mandatory. Can they do that?  Yes, an employer can tell its employees when to work.  They sure can. You're free to not show up but in the same vein they're free to fire you for not showing up. Yes.
