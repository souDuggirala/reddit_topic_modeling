 The form he was going to fill out also required documentation to be attached. He provided a diagnosis but did not attach the documentation, which the test he conducted was supposed to serve the purpose of. So the forms he was supposed to fill out were incomplete, and he is not giving me the results of the test I took so that I can properly attach it as documentation. He said he would "give them to me at my next appointment" on Friday. I think he is trying to string me along, but I believe I am entitled to my test results without attending another appointment, I have been seeing another psychiatrist anyway and this office has been shady in many ways. What do I do? I wouldn't have thought you'd necessarily be privy to those results....but I guess you are, if you can get them at a subsequent appointment? Presumably they take time to tabulate; perhaps that's why. Yes, it is being done for a third party. He did not review the test with me, so that is right. But if I want to see the test results, I believe I should be able to without having an appointment where he interprets the results for me. Is this test being done for a third party, like a prospective employer? Did he already review the results of the test with you? If not, thatâ€™s why he wants to wait until your next appointment.
