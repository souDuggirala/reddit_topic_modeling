 Here in Iowa, is one legally obligated to pay the full fee of towing upon retrieval? ($600+) Or can one get the fee billed? Can they hold the vehicle if some of the payment is made and the rest billed out? Is the owner of the vehicle the only one to get it out? It is a single car accident that will 100% definitely be towed back. I am finding mixed answers online as it varies to state, county, city. Let me know if more information is needed. How about just calling the tow company and asking what their policy is?  If they are saying they will not release your vehicle without full payment then your options are to pay in full or call the police and I doubt the police will assist you if the tow was lawful. Like I said, I have found mixed answers on this.  I'm not aware of any law which requires a tow yard to release your vehicle without payment in full.
