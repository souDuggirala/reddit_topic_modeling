 So I just woke up to the news from my boyfriend that a car had crashed into his room while sleeping. He woke up screaming and really frightened. I keep texting him to make sure he’s okay but he hasn’t responded. So from the looks of the pictures he sent me two cars crashed and then one ended up hitting his house. The car didn’t go through his room but it did hit the wall and many things are destroyed/on the floor. I’m not sure if he got hit because he hasn’t responded, but can he be compensated for the distress he’s in? He’s really shaken up and there’s only so much I can say to soothe him. Thank you in advance! We live on California! TL;DR: Car crashed into boyfriend’s room while sleeping. He’s really shaken up and I’m not sure if he was physically hurt by the car or the things falling. Can he sue/get compensated? Yes, I second this. Renters insurance is a life saver. And he may not be responding because he needs to talk with the parties involved or the police. Give him some time. I hope he's insured. If he has owner's/renter's insurance, then this will largely solve itself. It'll take some time while the various insurers involved hash out who is paying what, but he won't have to deal with the issue. He won't be compensated for being shaken up, but most policies will cover his temporary accommodations, his medical bills, and the value of any covered property that was destroyed. If he's _not_ insured, then he should speak to a personal injury attorney as soon as he's back from the doctor's. He'll be on his own to recover anything from the driver and their insurance. If it gets to the point that he needs to speak to a mental health professional and he goes through some type of treatment, then yes, he may seek compensation. But at this point, you're putting the cart way before the horse.
