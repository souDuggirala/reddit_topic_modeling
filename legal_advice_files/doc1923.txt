 Say a guy rents a room from some lady in a single family home. She files a claim for damages and it is approved for loss of use coverage for her to stay in a hotel while the issue is fixed. The insurance company says to him, in a phone conversation, that he will be reimbursed, and provides an e-mail address to submit receipts. Then he e-mails the receipts. Then he is told the check was sent to the landlord AKA his housemate AKA the policy holder and he would have to arrange to be reimbursed by her. She refuses. Is this legal? Who did him wrong? Should the insurance company have paid him, as was the verbal agreement?  Did he pay rent for the time he was out of the house?
