 So I know someone who's SO recently passed and she had all her paychecks direct deposited into his account and he handled the bills. Unfortunately since her name wasn't on the account they are trying to give it to someone else who is next of kin and pretty scummy. Question is with proof from the employer and such is there any information that can be provided to compensate friend in anyway? This is upstate NEW YORK btw
