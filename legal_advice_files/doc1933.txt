 They logged in on my computer a long time ago and saved the password. I have access to their academic records and any communication from the university. Technically have the ability to enrol and remove them from courses. I have not done these things and will not do anything that serious.  Not familiar with NZ, in the US you can be kicked out of your university for that. All the person has to do is change their password at the first sign of suspicious activity. You hope I end up in jail purely because I’m logged into someone’s account? I have no intention to do anything with this information. I hope they give you poor advice and you end up in jail because of it. This is idiotic and this is one of the cases in the world where being the bigger person is almost a necessity. Without going into to much detail, and with acknowledging that this is something shitty to do: the person was emotionally and somewhat physically abusive to me(used to be her friend) and very much of those to her ex boyfriend. She tried to have me kicked off of my lease and assaulted a friend then made a false accusation against him claiming assault. I know morally what I’m doing is wrong Legal or not, that'd be a dick move. Why cause yourself the potential of getting in legal trouble? Just delete the info and forget about it. Don't be an idiot.
