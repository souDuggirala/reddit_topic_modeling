 Tennant is allowed two cats, on two seperate ocassions over a month a part i saw three cats. They say the 3rd cat was being babysat and its been removed. How can i verify this? Also they hit one of our trees last week, it left an apple size crater in the tree. We were never notifed, our neighbor just told us though and its at the back of their parking spot. Is this a hit and run? Also what can be done to address this damage? You can give notice for an inspection, then take tons of pictures. How many let boxes, how many beds, etc. Yes, you can have multiples for a single cat, but pictures are incredible for proving things.  My tenant Is this your tenant, or your neighbor? What does their lease say about inspections, maintenance and such?  oh it doesnt, but they said it was removed and no longer there. Which i am okay with that being the case and will drop it. I just wanted to know what is the most legal way i can verify this? Just look through a door while they are out?? You don't need to verify anything as I doubt their lease has a provision for babysitting a pet. It's enough to know they were in violation.
