 On the Dateline nbc series “To Catch a Predator”, how are they allowed to use the footage without the consent of the people being recorded? Also, why would it not be considered entrapment? Because Chris Hansen is not an officer and the police never actually enter the room that the person is being interrogated in? Watching this show has raised a lot of legal questions so anything else you guys know about how The show operates from a legal standpoint would be really interesting to hear!
