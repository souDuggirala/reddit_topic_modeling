My gf lives with her mum and her mum's boyfriend. She is 19 same age as me and is working as a hostess for a restaurant change. My gf is supposed to be on just over £500 every two weeks but she hasn't been paid properly since she has started so it is hard to calculate a actual monthly salary. 
Any way my gf's mum lives in a bungalow and rents it for £300 a month and council tax of £180 and other things coming to a total of £1043.87 and they split it around £347.95 each but my gf pays £360, her mum pays more, but the mums boyfriend pays less then my gf even tho he lives there and also he is payed nearly double both their wage. 
Her mum has also put down the fuel for taking my gf places such as driving her to mine (which she doesn't even do much I drive my gf around most of the time). 
My gf is tbh most of the time round mine and is fed by my mum and by her work even tho my gf is charged a third of the food bills too. 
Oh and her mum is also trying to make my gf pay for her car to be fixed... 

Sorry it's kinda a rant and a panic but please I am so angry and I don't know what to do, I feel like my gf is being taken advantage of by her MUM. Just need some out side views, what do you guys think and what should we/she do? 

Also sorry for grammar and spelling This isn't a legal issue, it's a relationships one. Your girlfriend can move out if she thinks she's getting an unfair deal at home.
