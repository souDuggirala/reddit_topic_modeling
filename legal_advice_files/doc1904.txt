 Hi everyone! First time poster, long time reader. This takes place in NJ. My husband got a settlement for a lawsuit from a car accident 3 years ago and our one friend brought up that we might have to pay taxes on it. Our lawyer never said anything about it and my husband canâ€™t call the lawyer till tomorrow so i wanted to see if anyone knew if we did. If you need more info (settlement statement or questions) i can give more. Thanks!  Thank you! It's not taxable. I am a personal injury lawyer.
