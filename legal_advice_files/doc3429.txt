 I have a court-ordered parenting plan in Washington. I used an attorney and was awarded 50/50 custody. Monday-Thursday morning and every-other Sunday (I asked for the schedule). Things have changed drastically, work schedule-wise. At the start the mother worked and I worked very different schedules. I asked for a schedule that made sense for the both of us. Now she is a stay at home mother with a younger daughter, and I work 4am-1pm with Sunday’s and Monday’s off. I feel that I am missing out on some crucial weekend time, activity wise, having friends over and sleepovers, that sort of thing. And my family does not get the see the kids often as I usually only them during the week. We are on the third year of the plan, so it can be modified. I asked the mother to go to a week on, week off schedule and she basically said no. This was over a year ago when we could first modify the plan. I just kind of need to know how to approach the situation. I want the change, regardless of how she feels about it. I’m just not sure how to get where, who to talk to, where to go...??? Any help is much appreciated. Thanks in advance, and thanks for reading! Thanks for the response  If you have the money, the simplest way would be to hire the attorney that originally drafted the parenting plan, or another attorney if they no longer practice. The more difficult way is to learn the court procedures yourself, and proceed pro se.
