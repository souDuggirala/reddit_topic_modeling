 This is a long and complicated story so I will break it down into bullet points... \ \ \ \ \ . (it's irrelevant to the tuition price that I had ended up dropping out half way through) \ 're bothering me with letters and phone calls constantly for 8,000 more dollars than what I do actually owe. I dont know what to do ... they wont leave me alone and this is money that I do not really owe to them... I tried to talk it out with the university but they are being really rude and mean about it - I dont really have the money to hire a lawyer but they wont leave me alone and I really want to settle this issue. The state is New York. What should I do? Thank you in advance for some advice.  I went through a formal appeals with them and gave them all this information but now they are telling me "TOO MUCH TIME HAS PASSED" and they WONT correct the situation because the deadline to correct it has passed and they sent it to collections so its too late - that is what they told me :( its awful I don't know what to do the debt people wont leave me alone and the school refuses to work with me... the in state tuition is just about 6,000 the out of state is just about 8,000 more so total its like 14,000 they want from me but I should only be paying 6,000.... thats all I could afford that why I applied there - how can I get them to do anything about this?  What address do they have on file at the registrar? I would bring them the taxes, DL, FAFSA and see if they could correct it. Also did you ever get a balance sheet on payment? It should show how much tuition was paid and how much was due.
