 Long story short, my friend, who is 17 now, used to sext a couple of years ago on Instagram using burner accounts. Those accounts were disabled by instagram btw for violation of terms of service. This was a couple of years ago, but he's afraid that this could somehow be brought up later, even years later. What especially concerns him is if he gets in trouble after he turns 18. If he gets into trouble after he turns 18, what are the conseuences? What should my friend do?.  First off, maybe don't sext when you're 14/15? Especially if you're sending nudes because that's child porn. Also, if the accounts were terminated and nothing has come up of it, why would something come up when you're 18? Johnny law isn't gonna bust your door down guns ablaze and arrest you for you sexting on insta years ago.  It's clear that you're the "friend". The advice remains the same as the last time you posted, stop being paranoid and move on with your life.
