 There have been two instances where they were to have communicated to my tenant that 1) work would be done in the unit by a licensed plumber and 2) that I would be entering the unit to verify the plumber's work was completed. In both instances my tenant was not notified. This is the contract language, which seems pretty clear-cut to me. I think I can send them a certified letter and call it a day, yes? "Termination for Convenience: Notwithstanding the anticipated Term provided herein, either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time during the Term for that party's convenience by giving the other party notice (Notice of Termination for Convenience") personally, by email or by certifified mail, return reciept requested. Such Notice of Termination for Convenience shall take effect on the last day of the first full calendar month following such notice. Manager shall distribute Owner's proceeds after termination, unless outstanding Manager or third-party obligations remain, in which case distribution shall be accomplished immediately after the last such obligation is satisfied."  Thought so, too, thanks!  That's a great idea, thank you! I had issues with my first management company. I went with a new company and they actually helped me draft a 30 day notice to provide to the original company. Made it easy for me to switch over.  Seems pretty cut and dry. Contract can be terminated a full calendar month following the notice.
