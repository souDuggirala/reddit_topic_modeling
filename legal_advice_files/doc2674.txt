 So I’m being extorted because I was told by a police officer to stop contacting a person. I did background search the cop was legit. The person extorting me is a real person and is my ex. She’s trying to get 4K from me and said I can be charge with intent to harm. Even though I never touched her and etc the harassment took place online. She’s in California during the time and I’m in Florida. One of my questions is can someone sue out of state and be present in the courtroom via Skype? Can I be sued even though I was left off with a warning by police? What can I do to get her to leave me alone. She even threatened to mail the owner of where I’m living the evidence against me and to show up to the property.
