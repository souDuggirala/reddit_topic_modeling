Friend of mine got caught with weed, but the cops gave this ticket for smoking in public area. I am wondering if they should get a lawyer. How bad is it? It requires in person court appearance. Should they need a lawyer? How is the punishment?  Was this person ticked for obstruction of highways or for smoking in public? Or both?

Anyone facing a charge on a drug-related offense should likely seek counsel.  Often there is an outcome possible that avoids conviction on a drug charge.  That is always advantageous.  It isn't so much the punishment for the offense which is often relatively small, but the criminal record that now includes a drug conviction.  

Your friend should seek a consultation with a lawyer.
