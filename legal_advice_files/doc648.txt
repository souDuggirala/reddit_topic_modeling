 My divorce has been dragging on for a long time, I am having difficulty to have him fully and accurately disclose assets during marriage. I am thinking to go to the court and file for temporary spousal support while case is pending. My question is x-spouse’s income has more than doubled since we separated. So should I ask for the temporary spouse support based on his current income or his income at separation? He also has been dishonest on his financial disclosure. ( from the incomplete statement he disclosed, I found that he had started his own account before separation and he had transferred the stock to his private account. And the statement do not match up with the numbers he disclosed) but he claim I am making it difficult for him to ask for all these the formation and he has no time to deal with this. I am thinking to have him sign a request for admission list, and if he continue to lie, I can hire an attorney to help me, and if proofs he lied, I can ask him pay for my attorney fees, is this a logical feasible thinking? As for now, I don’t have any money to hire an attorney. Also what is ESA? There was a statement says he transferred a very large chunk of money to ESA. But I don’t know what that is and there is nothing in his disclosure is called ESA. Thank you
