 Hi everybody! (First of all, I'm a native French speaker so you'll excuse me for my poor English) I lived in Canada (Quebec) for a year and during that year, as I was discovering proper Canadian outdoor activities, I wanted to try slingshot and I ordered a badass "brass knuckle slingshot" online via Aliexpress. ( you can see what it looks like here: []() ) I just didn't realize I ordered an illegal weapon. A few weeks later, I found in my mailbox a letter from the Canadian Border Services Agency, which was enclosed in another envelope to make it even scarier. So, I opened it and it shows a "notice of seizure", and I don't know more about it besides the fact that I figured brass knuckles are prohibited by weapons regulations! As I'm planning to reapply for a study permit, a Quebec Acceptance Certificate, the permanent residency and eventually the citizenship, my question is: Will this affect the procedures and prevent me from getting any of these? Thank you for your answers! I'm freaking out right now, I may have to rethink my whole life plan! :'( Thank you so much ! :)  I work for canadian immigration and to my experience it shouldnt hurt your application but it maaaaay delay it depending on how the officer wants to handle to case. if you have the option i would submit a letter explaining what happened. it seems like it was just an honest mistake and i would state that in your application. ONLY if it comes up or they want to know more information about it. other than that i wouldnt worry to much about it EDIT: ive seen people with far worse get issued a SP
