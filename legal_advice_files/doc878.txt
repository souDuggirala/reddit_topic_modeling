 My mother just informed me that a close family friend suffered a car accident. He had dropped off a friend in a different city and got lost and was unable to get home. After contacting his son, he later called his son back to inform him he was in an accident. He was able to tell his son what street he was in and later lost connection. After his son arrived at the scene of the accident, the sheriff pointed him in the direction the ambulance went. It took a while to find out which hospital the man was taken to. He supposedly died on the way to the hospital in the ambulance, but when his wife went to view the body, the nurses refused to let her see him, saying that it wasn't allowed. He died at 1am but she was not notified until 7am, and the hospital only called to ask her if she wanted his organs donated. Despite multiple attempts from family, including the man's sons and speaking to the Head nurse and her supervisor, no one has been able to see his body. Another thing is that she was given a different story from another hospital employee, saying that he actually died in the hospital from internal bleeding. The only thing they've given her is an envelope with his work permit and ID. They told her they have no idea where his other possessions such as this wallet are at. Is there any legal recourse to take? Why would the hospital not allow family to view the deceased? He unfortunately died about an hour away from home, so it has been a burden going to the hospital only to be told that it isn't possible to see him. Apologize for format, I'm on mobile.  Iâ€™m sorry for your loss. The hospital is probably attempting to help you avoid additional trauma by not viewing out relative in their current condition.  You can contact a private morgue to have them pick up the body and then ask to see the body.
