 Received a letter from the USIPS about a package withheld from delivery for "Hazardous, Restricted, and Perishable Mail." My address was put as the from address and the to address was unknown to me until I google searched it. After googling it the name of the parents of an old friend came up. The "friend" lives in the same city as me and does know my address down to the apt number... I have literally no idea what in this package, never seen it, I have no idea what this guy is shipping with my address on it. Do you have a legal question? Don't talk to anyone without a lawyer.
