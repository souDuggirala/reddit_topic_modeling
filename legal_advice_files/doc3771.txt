 Hey guys, be aware this is kind of stupid. Around two years ago when me and G (Girl) were in seventh grade we were on the bus coming back from a field trip. The class started chanted my name and her name. Presumably for us to date which neither of us are interested in. I took a video which filmed my seat of the bus and showed no kids and only heard voices. I posted the video to my public instagram Today almost two years later she has come and told me that her friends laugh about her and this video and shame her and that she will take me to court and sue me for a lot of money. She says that this video has shamed her and negatively impacted her life. Could she really sue me? Oh no! Not likes! So, you'd rather be an asshole than do the right thing over a paltry amount of likes. You will find out pretty quickly that 1. Likes don't matter in real life. 2. 200 likes is nothing. Take this as a lesson in Adulting.  I don't want to take it down though. It has my most likes 200+ NAL, but she's not going to sue you. Take the video down, say, "sorry, I thought it was just funny and wasn't trying to hurt you by it", and let it go. She'll do the same.
