 My lawyer already has a plea set for me.... I haven't cut the terms of what im agreeing to but wreckless driving is the charge. So my question can I just wear slacks n a polo or still do the whole fit  Great answer thank you.  With respect, its not about looking sharp, its about looking respectful. Your cutting a plea so you probably did something wrong. You acknowledge that and take responsibility and hope for a favorable disposition. Part of this is conveying to the judge that you respect the authority and office they represent. So, no jeans, neat grooming, nice shirt and tie at a minimum, suit if you have one.  I haven't a clue the time schedule of the court Okay thank you, do you expect it to take several hours? I thought like an hour but appreciate the headups so I can email my professor. The sharper you look the better. Nothing to lose but being uncomfortable for a couple hours. But if that's more important.....
