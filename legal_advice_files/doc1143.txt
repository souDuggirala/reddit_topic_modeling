 In Michigan. Things are getting ugly with the STBX wife. She's spent roughly 5 or 6 nights away from home with different guys on what she claims is "her time", we haven't even filed for separation yet. She's under the impression this would no problem in family court but I disagree. How would it look if shown evidence she was spending multiple night away from home with new partners while I stayed and took care of the kids? That was sort of my assumption. Just tell your lawyer.  I'm here every night and I've documented every night she's gone.  Document the nights she handles childcare and the nights you do, give those records to your lawyer. It may have an effect in custody.  It’s hard to say what the judge in your case will think about your wife dating before the divorce is finalized. It probably won’t really matter. Just share everything you know with your lawyer (concisely) and keep moving forward. Remember that what is best for the kids is the goal, not “winning” the divorce.  Watch out for yourself man mi is hard on men in divorce cases
