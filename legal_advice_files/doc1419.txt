 Hello; I am an independant game developper based in France, and have recently published an early access version of my game on patreon. People can follow my progress, support me by giving me money monthly, and as an incentive get to play a bit more of the game than most people. However recently someone started redistributing said early access version of the game for free, on a download website that makes revenue through ads and what seems to be a very fishy form of subscription. I obviously have not given them permission to do that as it messes with my income. I have tried to get it taken down but the website in question offers no way to contact them, I cannot seem to have a proper way to remove the referencing to said site on google, and if I'm perfectly honest the French police website/Hadopi website about piracy are confusing and very little help. I would like to know what recourses I have to efficiently protect my game from that kind of piracy now and in the future (when I distribute it on steam and other platforms), as well as any others leads on how to take that website down legally.  Contact the domain registrar Only thing I can think of is to see if you can find out where the site is hosted and tell them their client is hosting illegal copies. Other than that, nothing. People in other countries don't care because they know you won't do anything.
