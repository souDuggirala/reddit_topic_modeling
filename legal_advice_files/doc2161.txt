 I play online poker, which is technically illegal in Florida as a Class B misdemeanor although apparently nobody has ever been charged in this state for merely being a player (only operators), so I was told it was pretty safe and that there's no interest in enforcing the law. But as I'm getting ready for taxes, I'm just wondering - if I claim gambling winnings and losses, and get audited, and show the IRS my documentation that some of those losses and winnings are from online poker, could they somehow rat me out to FL authorities who could arrest me? I thought I heard that the IRS isn't supposed to reveal info about crimes like that, but in practice they do. But that's for stuff like drug dealing and embezzlement, not a class-B misdemeanor FL law that doesn't seem to be enforced... Probably worrying about nothing, just wanted some other people's take on it. If there is a risk, what rights do I have under the 5th amendment when getting audited to make sure I don't have to reveal that information? How much have you made in poker winnings? If you're concerned, I would just have a tax pro do a fifth amendment return for you. Usually best if prepared by a tax attorney. The IRS doesn't care how you made your money. They just want it reported.  You must report the income but you don't have to report the source. If audited, you could redact any information that would identify the source of the income.
