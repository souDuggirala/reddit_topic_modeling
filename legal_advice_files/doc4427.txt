 I'm about 90% sure x is true about y, and warned z. But now I'm doubting whether I made the right choice morally, since I'm not sure. I did tell z that I wasn't sure x was true when I repeated the rumor. If x turns out to be false am I liable? Does the qualifier matter?  Yeah I didn't present it as fact. I just stated that x alleged it and also described other evidence.  If you say "John Smith said that [insert statement]" and John Smith actually did say it, then your statement is accurate.
