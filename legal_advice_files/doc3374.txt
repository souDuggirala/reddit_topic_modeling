 OP: [\_to\_resign\_as\_a\_partner\_to\_a\_startup/]() So we're in Illinois, and after talking with one of my partners, who seems to actually share my vision for where our business should go. We're looking into options to push out our third partner. Being a startup, our company still really has not value according to our accountant. So I'm trying to drum up some options to buy him out. 1) We take over the business including debts like the a Loan credit card etc. Each member retains the personal liability of another outstanding note. The payment will continue to be paid by the business. Pending the result of a lawsuit regarding this note, his initial cash investments will be paid back out of that or be paid in installments to be negotiated after we know the outcome. If we get more than what we owe and above his investments, we split that 3 ways. 2) Same as above, but we take over his personal liability of the note, and he walks away. But in the event we win the suit and/or are offered a settlement above the amount what we owe, the business keep that payment. Do these seem like legal options?  Thank you for posting an update!
