 I committed a bad thing and the person married to the person I committed the bad thing against said to give us money and we will stay quiet. I gave them $300 already but can’t afford to give anymore. The first time, they wanted $200 and they came back 20 minutes later saying there was more to the story and they wanted $100. I really don’t want this bad thing to be known by family because of how bad it is. But I can’t afford to give anymore. They said they promise they would never return after I gave them the $100 but I’m still scared they might come back to threaten to call the police. If they return, what should I do? They are homeless if that means anything. It was a sexual advance. I really regret and have been contemplating very bad thoughts. Please help. TL;DR made a sexual advance on lady and husband demanded to give them money and promised to never speak or bring it up again.  ...and he deleted the post, so you are probably right.  If that is actually the case (and I’m thinking it’s not; this almost seems like a troll post), the chances of a random homeless couple tracking OP down and telling his family that he made a pass at the woman is highly unlikely. OP probably did a much worse thing or is a troll. He hit on a homeless lady. If he’s married or engaged, he probably doesn’t want family to find out.  You can't buy silence, you can only rent it. You are being extorted. Go to the police.  By sexual advance do you mean sexually assaulted? Because I can’t imagine you’re allowing yourself to be blackmailed because you hit on someone.
