 Not sure if this is the right sub but here is goes: Me and my father cosigned a car together. I am the one that pays for the car's maintenance and gas because I am the user of the car. However, he is the one who purchased the car. We are currently on bad term right. Is he allowed to sell the car in the future without my permission because he technically owns the car as well? If in the future he chooses to hide the car from me, like stow it at a relatives land, is it okay if I report the car as stolen? I will do that on Tuesday morning because the DMV is closed Sun and Mon ðŸ‘Œ Remember to get yourself a copy of the title if your name is on it and keep that somewhere safe. I remember signing a piece of paper at the DMV with my dad the same day we bought the cat from it's previous owner. I will have to double check with the DMV to see what it was because I signed it like 4 years ago Are you both on the title or did you just cosign a loan for the car?  So he can do whatever though we co-signed together? His title his car.
