 I am looking to purchase vending machines and ATM's and would really appreciate if some of y'all could tell me if there are legal steps such as license and registration kinda things I would have to do. I did some research and it seems like in Florida you just need to register them under businesses LLC's and pay taxes for them, but I am on very slow connection right now and do not have the patience to wait so long to figure this stuff out, lol, thank u very much and have an amazing day!
