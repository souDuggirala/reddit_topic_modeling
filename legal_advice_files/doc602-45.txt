Server here. Boss takes 15 percent of our tips and claims this is what the bank charges for credit card transactions, which is I know legal to take from tips, but this percentage seems unreasonably high to me. Anyone have experience in how much banks charge for credit cards etc? Are you working for a national chain restaurant? Franchise? Or an independent mom-and-pop place? If it's a national chain, they may have policies related to tips that your employer is violating. They are allowed in Alabama to collect a percentage of the tip that corresponds to the processing fee % on only the tip portion of the bill, and only for credit card tips (not for cash tips like in a tip pool).

There isn't a single fee structure, but the average fee is 2.5% to 3% according to what I'm reading.  So it would be OK for your employer to withhold 2-3% of the credit card tips.  Not 15% of the tips, and not 15% of the bill. I spent several years in the payment processing industry. Most restaurants pay an effective processing rate around 2.5% total -- meaning if they do $100,000 in credit cards on a given month, their total processing fees, between interchange and the processors costs, would amount to about $2,500. 

I'm not sure if they can legally charge you anything, but even if they can, 15% would insanely egregious.  [deleted] Not a lawyer but I don't think they can charge you more than their actual processing fee. They can also only deduct the fee for the tip portion of the bill. That is they can't deduct the credit card processing fee for the total bill from your tips. They also have to ensure you are getting minimum wage after these deductions.
