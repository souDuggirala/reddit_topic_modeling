 Not sure if this is the right place to ask. But... I am a US Citizen. My girlfriend is a Japanese citizen, but is a US Green Card holder. She has lived in the US for about 14 years and is a professor at a nearby university. Sheâ€™s also on tenure track (if that matters). Anyway, if we want to get married, do we need to go through some extra process or paperwork (in addition to the regular stuff)? Added to this, my girlfriend says Japan does not allow for dual citizenship. So not sure how that further complicates things. I appreciate any guidance on this! I wish that was a concern! No issues. She doesn't have to become a US citizen if she doesn't want to. Only area where her remaining a non-citizen may come into play is with regard to gift And estate taxes, but statistically that's unlikely to be a concern (though I obviously don't know your financial situation). No issue at all (I am naturalized citizen). In general, marriages are completely independent of immigration status. Where it becomes tricky is obtaining immigration status based on the marriage which isn't the case here at all. AFAIK, in terms of getting married, there is no bar based on citizenship. Usually, the complicating factor in weddings involving citizens from different countries is securing the visas and getting that person into the US. If she's already in the country, then you don't really have an issue there. Your fiancee/gf doesn't need to ever become an American citizen if she wants to keep her Japanese citizenship. This has no bearing on getting married. There is no law saying that a married couple must have the same citizenship.  Not in your situation. The paperwork is all about getting the non-citizenship holding spouse a visa/green card/citizenship more quickly and/or easily It doesn't matter here because she's already met the time requirements for naturalization
