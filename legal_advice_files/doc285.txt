 Last year, my family (2 adults, 4 children), were covered by a Blue Shield Plan set up through Covered CA. In December 2018, we became eligible for insurance through our small business, and signed up for a new plan through a different insurance provider effective 1/1/19. Today, I got a bill from Blue Shield for $3700, for insurance premiums for January 2019 and February 2019. I called them to let them know we canceled our insurance with them and are covered elsewhere. I was then told that unless we canceled through Covered CA prior to 1/1/19, the premiums are still owed. I was then patched through to a Covered CA representative that told me that the earliest effective cancellation date is 2/28/19 and that the $3700 is owed. Apparently, Covered CA sent a letter out in November stating that if we did not cancel our old insurance by 12/15/18, it would be automatically renewed. I never received this letter, nor did I consent to using this insurance for 2019. How do I escalate this? I obviously do not want to pay almost four grand for a service we arenâ€™t using while paying an arm and a leg already for the insurance we are actually using. What should the next steps be? Thanks!  Sometimes contacting your state or federal representatives offices can help with these insurance issues. There might be a consumer rights type of office as well.  What were the terms of your original purchase from Covered CA? Did they provide for automatic renewal of the plan? It is overall quite likely that you can't just walk away from an insurance policy and see it canceled. Obviously if you were in the opposite argument - you did nothing and they just ended your coverage - you would be outraged. $3700 is owed. On balance that is likely a reasonable statement. You might review your plan documents carefully to be sure.
