 So I am involved in the theatre department at a middle school and we were at rehearsal working on the show and stuff, so we were getting near to the end and we were being lighting trees in because we can’t leave them out, so beforehand we had saw that a part of the curtain trail had been separated and not flush and so there’s this thing called a leg where it has bar with a small curtain on it and it’s on like a little 4 wheeled thing to make it slide on the track, and so half of the wheels of the leg where off the track, once we found this out we told the building manager about this as my school is under renovation and they were the ones who installed it, so the building manager said that it wasn’t right and that he would have someone fix it right away, we later found out that all the construction workers had left and the leg was not fixed, so we were putting the trees in and the leg fell on a kid and had him unresponsive for 3 seconds, we called the ambulance and we ended rehearsal shortly, right now he is in the hospital seeing if he had received a concussion but I was told that he was mumbling, this happened around an hour and a half ago, in the student handbook for it’s guidelines and such it has a right where “ students have a right to a safe environment” if that helps with anything and I’m wondering if there’s a chance for him to sue the school, the construction company, or the curtain installers You, or he, should give the school system enough time to take care of the cost of the medical prior to worrying about suing anyone. Ok then The costs incurred relative to the incident. Idk I’m just wondering if he could sue for something  He would be due the cost of any medical treatment from the incident. What would he sue for?
