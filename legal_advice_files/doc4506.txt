 So full disclosure, this didn’t happen to me, but happened to some friends of mine in Virginia. This guy we all know who’s always been kind of a creep, got ahold of a bunch of girl’s nudes and has been using fake numbers to text other girls, pretending to be a specific girl, to flirt and get more nude photos of them. Someone figured it out it was him and outed him for it. Now, multiple girls are coming forward with proof, screenshots of it happening to them. I know this is illegal somehow, but I’m not sure where it falls under and I want to point them in the right direction. Is this a revenge porn law? Criminal harassment? Identity theft? What are the steps they should take against him? This happened in Virginia.   People don't have to fully understand the law or under what statutes someone might be charged to contact the police. Investigating the potential crime and deciding if one occurred is the job of police and prosecutors. Virginia indeed has statutes under which the distribution of nudes might be prosecuted.
