 I'm at work but our third roommate was home to let him in. He came home delirious and exhausted so he crashed and is sleeping now but yeah all his stuff was mugged off of him last night. He just remembers it was two guys at the bar that started talking/hanging out with him and that's it. He came to this morning, somewhere, and then stumbled to a police station and asked the cops to drive him home. The cops said they couldn't do anything for him because he didn't remember anything. He drinks pretty regularly, like beers and sake, and is really good at handling his alcohol, and barely acts weird even when he's been drinking at home and is on his like 5th beer. Plus, he goes out alone frequently and has friends at the bars, and comes home just fine on his own. So the third roommate and I think it's very possible that he got drugged. What should we be careful about in terms of our safety? We are thinking we might have to ask our landlord to change the locks because if those men find our address they can easily come in. Can my roommate do anything legally? If he remembers more, can he go to the cops and try to get the two guys arrested?   That's a prudent move. Obviously your landlord may charge you the cost of that change. Your roommate can always report additional details he may remember to the police. There will be some question as to the credibility of information that comes up after the drunken fact in this way.
