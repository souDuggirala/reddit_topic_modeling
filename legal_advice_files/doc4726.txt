 My grandma has 2 children , my dad and my aunt, both of which have passed away with cancer. That being said, her caretaker and POA currently is my cousin as my grandma is living on her own with dementia. This has been the arrangement for years, however, it has come to my siblings and my attention that my cousin has been keeping a lot my grandmas social security money for her self, and is using the bare minimum for my grandma to live on and only coming in giving my grandma her pills and then immediately leaving. My grandma has been begging my siblings to change her POA and get her in a nursing home because sheâ€™s scared to live alone. The issue is my cousin has put my grandma into debt. Along with this, my grandma owns 3 properties in which she rented out, currently 2/3 of the homes are vacant and my cousin is living rent free in the 3rd. My grandma is not eligible for the Medicaid she needs to go to a nursing home until she sells her properties in which my cousin will not allow as she is living in one. My little sister, who tries to visit as much as possible (as all of my siblings live and hour + away while all of my cousins live ~5 minutes away) tried to get a lawyer and fight for POA but she is 18 and my cousin is 40. Is there anything I am able to do to help my grandma?  Someone needs to petition the court to become your grandmother's guardian. You don't have to fight the POA. A guardian has authority over the person under their care. The guardian, in their capacity, can just revoke the POA. Having said that, there's nothing preventing your cousin from trying to become the guardian herself.
