 Preface: This tenant has always been timely with payments. I just received notice that a tenant has filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. The notice mentions objecting to exemptions and filing a proof of claim as well as other terms I don't fully understand. Could someone here help me understand the process? Should I contact an attorney? Thank you.
