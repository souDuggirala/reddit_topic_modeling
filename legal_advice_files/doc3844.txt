 Is it okay if I write a book called "Opinion/Comment about \insert famous name\", in this case I'm thinking of a public speaker, the topic would be commenting (several chapters) about his views, arguments and statements and how they impact society. Would that cause me any legal issues? I'm living in the EU, but the person is from USA.
