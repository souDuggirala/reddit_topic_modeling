 Hello all. Long time lurker, first time poster. Just finally made an account yesterday. I hope this question is appropriate for this sub. If not please let me know. Long story short I'm starting the process to become an independent contractor/vendor with a large home builder. I do not have an S-corp set up yet so I am setting up to be a vendor just under my name as an individual. This large home builder requires all vendors to have workers compensation self-insurance to become an authorized vendor. Am I able to purchase and carry workers compensation insurance as an individual or will I require an S-corp and tax ID and carry it under a business. If it helps I live in Ohio and all business will be conducted in Ohio. Thanks!
