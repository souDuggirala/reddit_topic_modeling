 I got pulled over the other day, and the cop said I was acting nervous. I think I probably was, but that's because I have an anxiety disorder, and I didn't know why I was being pulled over(tail light out). He asked if he could search my car, and I told him I didn't consent to searches. He then said he could smell fresh, un-smoked marijuana in my car, so he had probable cause to search it, and then did so. I didn't have any weed in my car, and hadn't had any in months, so I know this was pure bullshit. My question is, how is this legal? How can he prove he "smelled" something? Is that really probable cause, or was he lying? Because I know cops can and do lie, and it really makes it hard to know the difference between standing up for your rights, and being unlawfully uncooperative. You should do a FOIA request for any video evidence of the stop. You should then write a letter to the local public defenders office and explain the full circumstances and a copy of the video. Finally, you should offer to testify in any case where this officer attempts to establish probable cause with his nose. Besides that, there is nothing you can do. And the only thing you can do on scene is say that you don't consent to a search.  The answer is never to resist physically. You can make it clear that you don't consent, but the place to argue "did the officer really have probable cause" is in court, and not on the side of the road.
