 This has happened to my husband. And he just claims he's never going to get paid. But I wanted to find out for sure. So my husband was laid off about 2 months ago while we were on Christmas Vacation. He comes back to find the business has been gutted and his boss is liquidating everything. He's owed a month of wages, and she said he would've been paid by now. There doesn't seem to be any clear answers about what to do next. What can he do to make sure he gets paid? We're in Canada.  Thank you! We need your province, but generally speaking, your husband would file a wage claim. The labour board will investigate the claim and assist you with recovering that money. If the employer is filing for bankruptcy, then your husbands claims will be lumped in with any other debtor claims and he'll be paid out once all the math is done. The key here is to get that wage claim in as soon as possible before this guy sells everything and disappears
