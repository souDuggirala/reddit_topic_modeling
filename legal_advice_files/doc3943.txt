 I know this varies by state and possibly context, but I'm wondering about recording a phone call with a company's customer service group. Often on these calls, there is a statement up front to the effect, "This call is recorded for quality assurance..." Presumably that counts as consent in a two-consent state. My question is if I wanted to record the call, do I need to also ask for consent (or make some sort of statement) or is their statement sufficient?
