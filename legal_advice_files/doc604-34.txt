Our mail box is one of the big community boxes with the entire block in the mail box. Our house happens to be right in front of the mail box. The way or parking situation is I have to park on the street. And I typically park about one to one and half car lengths away from the mail box to avoid blocking it. But just last week they left A note asking me to move. 

So I went in and asked why they left the note and they said they would hold our mail if we did not move even though I made it perfectly clear that I do not block the mail box. 

Is there a law that states how far away you have to be? And can they legally hold my mail for parking 1-2 car lengths away from the mail box? http://www.huntingtoncountytab.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale500w/public/community/USPS%2520snow%2520obstruction.jpg?itok=qUyy-ouX

Need a car length on both sides at min.  More if it's a high speed road or ice/snow Id imagine that since I'm parked more than car lengths and almost two, that considering the size of a typical mail truck, they should be able to pull up completely fine without getting out or having to back up. 

But would they just decide to hold mine but still deliver everyone else mail since we all share a big mail box? If we can't to your box without backing or getting out of the truck, the mail is held.  

Safety, avoiding accident,  plus time issues.   There is simply no time to hold everyone's hand.  Keep the area clear Mail trucks have to be able to pull up to and away from a mail box without doing any kind of backing. Depends on the place/city in Oregon -- many localities have laws prohibiting you from parking within X feet (generally 10 or so) of the mailbox.

Portland has one: [https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/64560](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/64560)

If your mail is being withheld and you're not violating a law like this, contact the Postmaster.
