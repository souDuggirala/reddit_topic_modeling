 Recently, I've received a jury summons for San Francisco, CA for me to be on-call for a week and possibly drive to the court to be selected. Long story short, this is unthinkable for someone with agoraphobia as bad as mine. In the past, I've been excused from jury duty (twice) with a note from my psychiatrist. This time, apparently, this isn't something that they can do since I work full-time. I called the court and explained that my full-time job (software development) lets me work remotely and their physical office is within 5 blocks of my parents' house but they say that there isn't anything they can do about it. Apparently, to be excused, I'd have to drive to the court to speak to a judge about how I can't drive to the court due to my anxiety disorder. I really don't want to quit this job so what are my other options? I've been staying with my parents (different county) for the last six months while still paying rent on my apartment in San Francisco. Can I change my address? That's an option on the form I received but I'm worried that it'll cause problems with my rental agreement. Can someone else take my psychiatrist's note to the courthouse on my behalf? Is there any way for me not to have to drive to this courthouse especially during the week of selection? Paying rent in SF but not living there?? The people who I talked to said that I could talk to a judge but only if I drove to the court. Could I get an attorney to do this on my behalf? Are you able to arrange a call with the judge?  This is terrible advice. Don't do this, OP. Throw the summons in the trash. Whoops, I guess you never received it. Profit.
