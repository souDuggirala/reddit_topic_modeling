 Late August of 2016 someone broke into my apartment and stole one of my hand guns and nothing else of value. It was listed as stolen on the police report and I have two calls over the past two years from detectives asking if it was still missing or never found to keep the fire arm listed as stolen. Fast forward to today, a detective called and informed me they recovered the stolen fire arm in North Carolina on a traffic stop. He will be working with the county to have it returned to me. I was reading online, it could be a while since it will most likely be used as evidence in the case on the person stopped with it. My question is, is there something that will protect me in the future if something comes back tied to the gun. Will the sherif office give me a letter stating the fire arm was not in my possession during “date to date”. Or what can I do to protect myself?  I'd ask for a copy of the police report showing when it was recovered. Were you able to make an insurance claim when the gun was stolen?  Just ask for that letter. You also can get the police report number and keep that. It will be updated with the recovery date, so if there ever is an issue, just refer to that. I concur. Who needs that headache. If it has no sentimental value, I'd tell them to destroy it. Chances are nothing would happen, but I wouldnt risk it still
