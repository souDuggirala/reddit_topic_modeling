 Hi, I live in Alberta, Canada and I just traded in my my old 2010 Journey for a 2013 Ford Escape. They told me they were paying me $5850 for my journey which was nice as I only owed $5242.31 and they told me I was gonna get a $600 check for the difference. I called my bank to ask if the old loan was paid out and they told me the dealership paid out the loan but only paid the $5242.31 and not the $5850 they said they'd be giving me. I was looking at my paperwork from the trade and they tacked the $5850 back onto my loan. I'm very naive when it comes to this stuff but why would I have to pay back the money to buy my old car? So, am I missing something here? Why would they say they'd pay $5850 and only pay out the remainder of the loan but still expect me to give them an extra $5850 on top of my loan? I asked for cash back and they gave me a cheque for $600. Saying it was from the manager pocket and to thank him for it. I shall call them Monday and see what they have to say. I've asked them questions about how long it would take for the loan to be paid out and they just said "I don't know"  I asked for cash back and they gave me a cheque for $600.

You should get a check for the difference between what you owed on your previous vehicle and what they gave you in trade unless they applied it towards the cost of the vehicle. So essentially they pay off your old vehicle and you finance the full cost of the new vehicle plus fees extras.  [Here's the bit from my paperwork.]() What was the purchase price + fees for your vehicle, and how much was the loan?
