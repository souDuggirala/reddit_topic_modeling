 I disputed with the 3 credit bureaus, and got it removed from only 1 of them. The account is not mine. I filed an online dispute with CFPB for those 2 that would not remove it, but if it cannot get removed, what are my next steps? Thank you, someone posted earlier and I called them and they put in a request to remove it. Then you should talk to the creditor directly in addition to disputing with the bureaus to give them an opportunity to investigate the account. Identity theft Thank you, but I can't afford that. I called the credit company directly just now and told them it's not my account. The rep said that since it's already been charged on and there is no balance or something like that, that they will put in a request to have it removed from my report. Should take about 3 months, but I'm hoping it's removed. I appreciate it, if you didn't post, I wouldn't have even thought to call the bank directly. When you say the account is not yours... Is it identity theft and someone opened an account in your name improperly or is it a valid account belonging to somebody else erroneously showing up on your file? Most of them charge a one time fee ranging from 100-300.. others charge a monthly amount until the disputes are resolved.  Any ideas on how much this will cost? I'm a college student Hire a credit repair company. They specialize in removing these items and know the intricacies of getting it removed.
