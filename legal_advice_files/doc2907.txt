 So my jobs HR is actively lying about open positions not being available when we are hurting for people. So another one of my co workers posted my works pay scale they have posted up onto social media saying this is a good place to come work and to come put in an application. Now HR is saying posting the pay scale online is illegal and aren’t allowed to do that or he could be fired, the fact the pay scale is posted up publicly we don’t see how this is a problem. Can my work fire you for this and is it really illegal to post a pay scale online? Thanks in advance.   Presuming you're in the US that's flirting with violating the FLSA and can put your employer in a world of hurt.
