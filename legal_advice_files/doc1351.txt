 Hi everyone. At my new job I work at a manufacturing plant that gets parts from my old job aka my old job is a supplier. I now have weekly meetings with the same people I worked with since they are the supplier. I was told I’m allowed to email anyone I want too, as it is part of networking. My team wants to build better relationships with the supplier and since I used to work with them, this seemed like a good opportunity. So I emailed an ex co worker asking if he would like to set up a meeting to go over a few project ideas I had to improve my teams relationship with supplier and knowledge of the product. The reason I chose this particular co worker was because he is very knowledgeable in the product. Anyway- he sent my email to Legal at his company and I’m very nervous. I haven’t heard anything yet. Is this really a conflict on interest? I did not ask for any favors nor did I release any information.? NO! No one is going to sue you. This guy is just letting his company know that he's talking to you about work stuff. It's not a big deal. do you think i will be sued? thats my fear, i was told it's okay for me to network  Honestly, I would likely do the same depending on where my ex-colleague worked. We have some serious rules about info that we are allowed to share and I'd want to make sure that I told someone and kept everyone in the know about any work relationship. thanks, def has kept me worrying this whole weekend  You are fine - he's likely just covering his ass.
