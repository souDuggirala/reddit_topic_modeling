 In California working for a school district running an off season athletics camp. I worked out my hourly rate based on pay for the season and number of hours worked and it’s about $7 an hour. Is this legal? Talk to your union rep. NAL, but my guess is that it’s legal so long as your overall wage is still above minimum wage. So if you work 40 hours a week at your normal duties and would normally get paid $1000, that’s $25 per hour. If you work an additional 5 hours at a stipend job and get paid $1035, then you’ve only made $7 per hour for the additional hours - but your overall rate for all your hours combined is $23/hour, which is still well above minimum wage. There are overtime issues that would complicate the above, but as a teacher you’re probably not required to be paid overtime. However, you should check your contract and check with your union, as there may be additional protections for you there. Where I am teachers’ unions are all but nonexistent, but I imagine they’re stronger in California.
