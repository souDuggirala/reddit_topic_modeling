 I'm just curious. For example, hypothetically, I marry a 12 year old boy with his parents consent. I had sex the boy prior to this marriage. Would that be excused and if I wanted to do it again, would be able to? Hypothetically. Also, would it be legal to pay the parents to allow the marriage. This all hypothetical. I know you can marry a minor if parents allow it.  For discussion of hypothetical legal questions, or other off topic law related questions please visit Legaladviceofftopic.
