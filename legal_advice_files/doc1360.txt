 im 16, moved to the U.S with my parents, on an F2 visa. according to my parents, to get a job i have to finish college with excellent grades for some employer to give me a job and sponsor me(which gives me a H1 visa and i can legally have a job in the U.S) . But i dont want to go to college, yet i dont think there is another way for me to get a job legally, like trade school or something. can yall please tell me if there is any way for me to legally get a job without going to college, even if its a minimum wage job.
