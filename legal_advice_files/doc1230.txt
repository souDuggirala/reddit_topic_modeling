 Recently my girlfriends employer laid off 300+ employees with little-to-no updates and didn't provide severance to any of them. Background, DECH (Dream Center Educational Holding) bought out EDMC (Educational management corporation) and Argosy University, (the company my girlfriend worked for), was closed due to receivership. In previous layoffs, (four months prior to the receivership), employees were awarded severance due to layoffs caused by downsizing. However, this was not the case for my girlfriend and her team. Is this a potential lawsuit? Could she and her team hire an employment attorney and take this to court? No, as long as they treat all the people in the same group the same way. Question, If one group is given severance but the other isn't, isn't there some issue with that? If not that's a bummer. Neither federal nor AZ state law requires severance pay. [removed]
