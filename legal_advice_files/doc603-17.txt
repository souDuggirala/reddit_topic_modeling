On my tenants Facebook, there is a picture of a stove for sale, which I believe is my property. There are also pictures of pets that are not approved (outlined in lease). My lease states that I have a right to enter with tenants permission and presence. I have asked tenant to arrange a time I can come by to take photos of my property (and make sure my stove is still there) However, tenant is refusing entry saying it is an invasion of privacy, and that they will send me any pictures I need. What are my legal rights to enter? I feel my property is in danger and that the tenant is breaking the lease agreement by having pets. One year lease  Is this tenant still on a fixed term lease or are they month to month? Why does your lease require tenant presence for entry? Take that out of your future leases (unless state law requires it), as you should have the right to enter with pepper notice regardless of tenant wants. 

As for the picture, see if you can look at the metadata and see the location, that should help.  This is a good resource:

Next question is going to be:  What do you do if you find the tenant is breaking the lease.

Notice to cure or quit, eviction etc..

You might be better off just handing the matter over to a landlord tenant attorney.

You will notice that in the link above:

&gt;Refusing a proper request to enter can be grounds for terminating the lease or eviction

&amp;#x200B; I suggest getting a lawyer. You may not need to gain entry to begin eviction for breaking the terms of the lease though, as the FB post w pictures of the pet in the unit may be sufficient.
