 Location: AR My brother and SIL got married in December 2017 and have been separated since October 2018. Brother has not done anything with divorce as she had been saying she wants to “reconcile and work it out.” But he has been to one consultation with a lawyer who specializes in Father Custody stuff. They have a one year old child. She has officially said everything right to make him want a divorce. Just from this past week he has told our mom and I she said: • “I sometimes cannot stand having [child] he’s too needy.” • “I hung out with my ex the other day. I really miss his friendship.” • “I got drunk with [friend] and she’s the one who encouraged me to talk to [ex] again because I needed a guy to talk to. Not you.” • “My mom told me I have 2 months to find somewhere else to live.” • “If we do end up getting a divorce you aren’t getting custody. I may not want to have [child] and I know you can use that against me, but you sure as hell aren’t getting any form of custody. A child needs his mom.” • “I don’t want my kid raised with a dad like you.” My brother is not perfect and some of this may not even be exactly what she said, but it wouldn’t surprise me. She had severe PPD and is extremely selfish. I wasn’t a huge fan of her. But that’s for a different time. He and our mom have both been tracking every time he has the baby on his own and for how long/how many consecutive days. He has been writing down every thing she says that is unusual/can be used against her. My questions are: • Is it legal to record phone calls or in person conversations without the other person knowing? Most of what has been said has not been in texts. • What is the best route for my brother to go with a divorce/custody battle? What other steps should he be taking with both? • What is any advice about this he may just need to know or hear?
