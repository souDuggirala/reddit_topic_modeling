 I'm posting on behalf of a friend who is on the phone absolutely freaking out at the moment over an issue that just occurred in his apartment complex; rather to the people below him. He lives on the 3rd floor above another tenant. During this particularly cold Winter, his pipes froze, they burst, and there was some leaking and damage done solely to the room directly below his. It was caused because he didn't turn his heat on (powered a boiler) nor did he feel the need to, after purchasing a space heater. This then caused water that powered his heater to sit, freeze, and, I turn, explode. He was not notified prior by his Landlord, who is pegging him for it, to keep it on. Is he at fault here or is this poor building structure? Thanks! If your insurance policies are written anything like ours are in Canada he actually voided the policy by failing to maintain proper and reasonable heat. He is absolutely 100% at fault and is liable for both the cost of repairs to the building and to compensate the tenants whose apartments he flooded. Hopefully he purchased renter's insurance with a liability rider that will cover this. Otherwise, he's going to be on the hook to pay out of pocket. It is common knowledge that water pipes will freeze if not used or the heat turned up high enough. Your friend is likely responsible for repairing the damaged pipes, the damaged floors/ceiling/walls and the damage to the apartment below, including that tenant's belongings.  Yes. The landlord doesn't need to tell the tenant to keep the heat on. That's just common sense.
