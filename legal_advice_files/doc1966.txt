 I bank with Navy Federal Credit Union. Someone in Kansas electronically signed off a $10,000 loan under my name. We got the IP Address and we proved to the bank that I was not in Kansas at that time as I am in the military far away from Kansas. The bank still denied my claim and I don’t know what to do now.  You might ask the NFCU where they sent the check and/or to trace the funds, since you did not apply for the loan nor receive the money. Since you are in the service, go see your command's JAG. My apologies, I didn’t clarify. I already went to the police and the FBI.  Report the identity theft and the loan to the police.
