 Father died 10/2017. We followed probate procedure. Letters were issued, notice was published in local paper, notice sent to known creditors. Ambulance company sent first bill late Sept 2018. We advised that my father was deceased (sent proof) and that the time to file a claim has passed. Now they sent it to collections, billing to the estate. Do we need to respond to this? Is it a valid debt? Having a hard time finding California law dealing with this.  If they sent the bill after the 60 days of publication of notice and after the four months since Letters were issued, but before the estate is closed, do I still then have to send the form DE157 Notice of Administration of Estate to the collection agency? Reading the law, it seems like this is likely.  Did the probate court order a final distribution of the estate? Under section 9103 of the California probate code, the creditor can petition to allow the claim under certain circumstances. Otherwise, under section 9002(b), the claim is barred. It's 60 days from the publication of the notice.
