 I was involved in an accident a few months back and intend to follow up legally with the other party. Her insurance company keeps calling me asking for payment without having gone to court. My insurance isn't covering the accident but I was insured am I legally liable for her damages? Should I continue with a legal follow up? From my understanding I should follow up legally because otherwise I'll be found at fault and paying her insurance company will also hold me at fault. I don't know what you mean by follow up legally, but I'll explain insurance a little bit. So your insurance does two things it indemnifies you from damages covered by your policy and provides a defense for claims that may fall under the policy. Liability insurance which is required by most states covers damage you cause to other people. If your insurance company determined that the other party was at fault, but they still try and come after you for damages, your insurance will still deal with that for you. You should follow up with your insurance company.  What kind of insurance did you have (compresensive, liability only, etc) and who was at fault for the accident? Why isn't your insurance covering the accident?
