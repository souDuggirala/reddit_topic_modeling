 I work in a nursing home in florida, just told them I'll have to miss a few hours of work for my aunts funeral and they started askinv me how I'd make up the hours (3 hours of work I'd miss) I'm not even asking for the whole day because I know they're short on hours. Can they legally force me to come back after the funeral and make up the missed hours? [removed] You can be fired or otherwise punished Their issue is they dont have enough people on the schedule for state requirements, this isnt the first time I was told I "had" to pick up hours only to find out when I got in touch with the DON that this was completely false. They can't force you to come. They can fire you if you don't. They do have a bereavement policy in the benefits, I'm not salary, I dont care if they put pto towards it or not. I have not been paid for these hours, so that's why I'm a bit confused as to why the first thing they mentioned was "well are you gonna come back after the funeral and finish your 3 hours" Well clearly. My question is that if I have to miss a portion of said time are they able to force me to come back in later in the day? At a previous job when my brother died there was no issue with this, this is the first place I've ever received bickering over needing to attend a funeral which is why I'm asking. If bereavement time isn’t a stated benefit, you’re salaried, and you aren’t expensing your hours as PTO, you either have to make up those hours you’re being paid for or they can withhold the pay for the hours you do not work. Management sets the schedule. You work when told you work. The exception is if there is a contract saying otherwise  Hmm okay, and they can make me "repay" those hours? I'm seeing two different answers in my google search  Yes, they don't have to provide any bereavement time.
