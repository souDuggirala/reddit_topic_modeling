 Hey all. For the past two years I’ve been harassed with thousands of collection calls. I’ve told them every time they call that I am not the right person, yet they continue to call. I’ve even reported them and nothing helped. Now, I’m curious if is legal if I play their game. I want to get an automated caller to spam their office phones like they do mine. Would I get in trouble by doing this? Thanks.  I’ve done that. I think they just keep selling the file to a new company.   Yes. It's harassment and mischief. Your remedy is to file a complaint with Consumer Protection Ontario:  Just change your number
