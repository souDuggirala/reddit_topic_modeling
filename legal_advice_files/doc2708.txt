 Okay, so I do digital advertising and consulting for businesses. Part of my marketing message is that I will get my clients more customers for less acquisition cost. This is the truth in most cases, given that my client has a good business model. I try to screen-out businesses that won't benefit from my services as much as possible. However, I've had problems in the past where, as I'm on-boarding a client, I realize that they've made their situation out to be more positive than it really is. The truth is, a marketing campaign is only as good as the company's business model. I have expertise in my field, but I'm not a miracle worker. Sometimes people think there is a demand for something and they just go into business without any kind of proof of concept. And of course, digital marketing is their first choice, because it's the most cost effective form of marketing there is for start-ups. But enough ranting, my question is: Should I be worried about advertising that I can get clients more customers for less, when it may not be the case for every client? I don't want to run into trouble with the FTC in the future. Thanks a lot!
