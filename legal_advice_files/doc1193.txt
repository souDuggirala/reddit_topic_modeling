 (Montreal, Quebec) I have a coworker who's 20 years older than me who won't stop making unwanted sexual remarks to me. He says things like he's going to grope my breats and butt and just won't stop talking about his penis to me. I've already told my boss. He received a second warning today but what can I do if it continues? I'm at a lost here. Pretty sure Canada is a one party consent for recording conversations. Use your phoneâ€™s voice memo option next time he talks to you for proof. Report it to HR, and read up [on your Rights. ]() I hope you get this resolved soon, no one should have to put up with deplorable behaviour.  I would take this to HR and I'd be really surprised that your boss hasnt done more then a write up or two. I'm sorry but being late all the time deserves a write up, talking about your penis to someone at work should be a fireable offence. Make sure they knew you are uncomfortable around this man and do not feel like you are safe at work anymore. Those are key words! Please stand up for yourself and if this person ever touches you in anyway go straight to HR or the police because at this point its harrassment.  Report him to HR.
