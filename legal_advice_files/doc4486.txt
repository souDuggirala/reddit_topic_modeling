 Hello, this is my first post. I've been a lurker for a long time, but finally decided to make an account as I have gotten myself into a situation. About a month ago I was stopped at a busy intersection in the middle lane. I thought both the right and middle lanes had to option to turn, but I was mistaken. I took the turn as the light became green, but the driver next to me went straight. She ran into the side of my car. Not much damage as we were both going probably 6-7 mph. We pulled over, exchanged information and she said we didn't have to call the cops as she "didn't have time". I agreed that our insurances could figure it out and we both left. I then got a call from my insurance a day later asking about the accident. They said the other party went home, filed a police report and is now saying she's injured. I was so shocked that she would lie and scared, as I am on my parent's policy, that I also lied and said she was the one at fault and changed lanes into the side of my car. Now she has an attorney and is threatening a lawsuit. I'm worried that this is insurance fraud and I may get into trouble. I'm not sure what to do. Can her attorney get camera footage from the intersection or nearby stores? Yes, lying to your insurance company about the circumstances of the accident is fraud. Get a lawyer.
