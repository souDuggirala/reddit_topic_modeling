 He road raged in 3:30 traffic on the freeway, followed me 15 miles, swerving into whatever lane i was in and hit me on my exit. He got out with his buddy and tried to fight me. I told him im calling the cops and he took off. I've filed a police report but how do I change this guys life?  Correct. The unstated implication of both particulars was “if you yourself are requested to pay for either your insurance deductible or a rental car.” Rental car is part of "damages" and you can only sue for your deductible if your insurance company pays rather than the other driver's. With one exception. You are able to sue for the amount of your insurance deductible (if any) and if you have to go out of pocket for a rental car while yours is fixed.  Thank you. Thank you.  You don't. You call his insurance company, they figure out your damages, you get your car fixed. If you are injured, you get your bills paid and maybe a small additional amount. If he is tried, you testify truthfully. That's it. Well, he's only liable for damages to your vehicle. You don't control any criminal aspect of it. That said, you contact your insurance regarding the damage, and the police regarding the rage.
