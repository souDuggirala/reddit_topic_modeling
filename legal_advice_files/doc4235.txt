 Throwaway for obvious reasons.Posting here since folks in relationships have been dming me about this sub. Background : We work remotely,all of us One of my had arranged a demo with a potential client, and 5 of us had booked our flights etc which gets reimbursed to us properly withing 10 days. So this guy messes up the dates and now all of us are on the wrong flights. Long story short,this person wants us to reschedule our flights by paying a exorbitant fee to the airline(fuck that) because he won't have to pay up for cancellation out of his own pocket and can get the rescheduling reimbursement from the company. To add to this since i and many others already have other work scheduled we might not even make it to the later rescheduled dates(Which btw are not fixed and we have to get the flexible rescheduling option by paying even more on top of the reschedule charge). So his solution to this is arrange a faux meeting that was not approved or might not be approved as there is as there is no need of 5 people being there.Invite us to that and get the company to pay for it. This to me sounds like straight up fraud and not standing up for your own fault. I am worried about reporting this to my manager's both of whom work remotely. As i am a new guy and this person has been there for the past 2 years or so and has a good bond with the manager. I absolutely love this job and this paves a long way for me and my future in my industry(Which i shall not name for reasons). TL;DR colleague messed up big time and now wants to commit fraud.  I think that instead of rescheduling flights the original booker wants them all to make a fake meeting and charge the company for the flights to and from both meetings? But, some more detail or a clearer explanation would be good. Rescheduling flights would be a normal business expense most places. I don't really see how this is fraud.
