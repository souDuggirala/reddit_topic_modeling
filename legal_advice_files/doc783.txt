 As i was graduating college i was charged with felony strangulation based on a fabricated police statement in the state of PA. The charges have since been dropped and the expungement process is under way. I need to move on but I am afraid to apply for a job in a state without ban the box protections based on info i found [here]() and elsewhere. I don't want my soon to be expunged record following me around for life so i have withheld applying to a new job. I want to take a job in NYC where a cursory glance through the hiring laws led me to believe that a background check cant be authorized until employment is offered and it seemed as though action cant be taken against those with a non-conviction. Will i be able to safely get away with applying without someone running a background check on me? By the time i manage to start working the expungement should be complete. Any help is extremely appreciated.
