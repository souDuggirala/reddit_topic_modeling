 I'm being sued in small claims and decided to counter sue Person sueing me. He listed his business address and is not there when being served by sheriff. What do judges do on court day for counter claims that where not successful on serving? It is a waste of time coming to court again for the same reasons. You could have any unrelated party serve the counter suit. Can you ask someone you know to go back when he is there and serve him?
