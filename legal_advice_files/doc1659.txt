 I have a friend that was abused as a child. It was thought the abuse came from outside the family at first. We recently found a letter from their father which acknowledges he was aware of it, and the was written to goad our friend into suicide. This friend has long known that the relationship with the father is unhealthy, but has been afraid to go no contact. With this letter, we now know that our friend needs protection and help cutting off contact with their parents. This friend lives with us. It is possible the parents will receive it badly. I want to be able to quickly get a restraining order if the dad becomes aggressive. What should we do in communicating the no contact, and documenting any interactions in order to get a restraining order if things escalate?
