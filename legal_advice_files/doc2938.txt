 In 2017, my lease expired with the landlord I was renting from and I started a month-by-month lease. A couple mo​nths later, the landlord sold the building to a new landlord. The new landlord is now trying to use the expired lease from the old landlord. Is he allowed to use that lease? Location is ME, US. The lease transfers to the new owner with the sale. If no new lease was drafted that lease is still in place, but with month to month terms. What is it exactly from the lease that he is trying to ’use’?
