Say I wanted to start selling wallets online. If I wanted to put spidermans face on it or hulks fist or the Avengers A on it, with actually putting the word, avengers, or marvel or spiderman or hulk on the product anywhere. Is that legal?

You would need to get permission from the copyright holders in order to do that.
