 I have a small commercial office that I rent which is not adequately heated. Parts of the day the temperature drops down to anywhere from 59 to 64°. I have notified the property manager several times two is offering a space heater which I have to pay for the electricity and it is also really loud. I talk to people in my office face to face and can’t have a loud space heater I also don’t want to pay the electric bill for it. What’s the best course of action? I don’t want to move. I also learned previous tenant had same issue and the problem is isolated to my office everyone else Complains it’s too hot in theirs. Norwood, MA Lease says I accept the place as it is and nothing is implied. Heat in commercial spaces needs to be 68 degrees during the day but the town says they don’t enforce it  Single office in a larger building. Looking at the lease now. Office have individual AC and heat is controlled by small groups of offices - heat to my office is controlled next door. What does your lease say? Is it a single office in a larger building? Strip center? Are the offices air conditioned individually?
