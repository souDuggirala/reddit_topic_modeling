 I just got a new job, which requires fingerprinting and a background check, no big deal. The problem is that they use a 3rd party fingerprinting company. This company requires $40 when i make an appointment. Can my job require me to pay? shouldn't they be the ones to pay this? Im in NJ if that matters.  Be aware that if you do pay for this it is likely deductible at tax time. You should consult your accountant to confirm. Perfectly legal and normal. You don't have to get them, but they don't have to hire you.  You may want to consider claiming financial hardship. You can't afford that right now. They have no reason to ask why. They may stop scheduling you as an employee, out you on suspension until you get fingerprinted, or fire you. Just want to make you aware of this as an option. It depends. If it's to get a certification or clearance required to work at any particular business, the company doesn't have to reimburse those expenses. Examples are SafeServ training, or Red Cross Lifgurad certification, or getting a law degree. The employer can say "we will only accept applicants who already have [blank] requirement", and not reimburse you for the cost of getting that qualification. So if it's something like a police clearance to be a security guard and get a state license; then no they don't have to pay. But if it's unique to that employer, or something like a drug test not tied to a certification; common practice is for the company to pick up the tab. Of course, there's nothing forcing you to pay - if the job isn't worth the extra cost, find a new one.  That sounds dumb, I went to my city office and they did mine for free.  depends.
