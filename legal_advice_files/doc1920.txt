 Got rear ended. Forgot to renew my license. Probably wouldn't even have known if I hadn't gotten into that car accident. Because my license was expired, am I now liable for everything? My insurance is good though, and not expired. Will my claims for auto, including injury now be denied? Thank you. Just got it renewel today. The status of your license doesn't change who's at fault. Whether or not your insurance covers you is up to what your policy says. If it requires you have a valid license to maintain coverage they may decline to cover you.
