 So 2 years ago someone tried to break in to my grandparents' house, so they decided to do an anonymous complaint to the court. Today a legal notice has arrived to our home that says " \My Grandparents name\ that lives \New Grandparents address\ have done a complaint about \Suspected name\." So now my parents are called in court , but they they do not even know who the suspected is and we are worried about consequences because the address is written to the legal notice and the suspected will recieve that too. Any advise to give me to support them?  The problem is that there is the address of my family in the legal note and we don't even know if the suspected is the real thief or not I don't know anything about the Italian legal system but in most legal systems the accused has a right to face their accuser.
