This is one situation where I am truly asking for a friend.
How can my friends get a group of boys caught  for sneaking into their beach house's hot tub. Their main security cam gets covered each time, but there is one still unseen. They shouldn't have access to that area. They also have weak evidence that those people broke their hot tub cover. I think that they can do things about trespassing, destruction of property, and covering their camera. 

They are very unhappy about this, but they want the criminals to be caught and at least lightly punished by law. 

Whoever their legal person through their security agency is, they seem to be incompetent.
 Yes, and the police did a minor inspection of the area. They didn't look at the spot where my friends saw damage... Have they filed a police report? Criminals don't usually get punished if no one reports them for breaking the law.
