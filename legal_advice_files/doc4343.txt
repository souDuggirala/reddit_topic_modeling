 My future father in law has a cat residing in his garden for a few weeks now. He doesn't want to let the cat in and he is going to drop him in another city. Is there anything i can do to prevent this? Ps not sure if i'm in the right subreddit No problem hope you find the cat a good home. Oh, okay thanks , will change subreddit then, and thanks for the info Definitely not the right place but can't he deliver the cat to an animal shelter? Or give it to a neighbor or family friend who would want it? If you're that worried you could do the same. Although I'm not from Belgium I have brought a dog to an animal shelter and it's not that hard.
