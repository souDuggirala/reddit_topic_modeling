 I am currently moving out of my apartment complex in PA. We just discovered that our landlords are automatically taking $100 from everyone's security deposit to clean the carpets. This is notified to us when we submitted our termination of lease forms. This statement is not written anywhere in our lease and there is no statement that can be interpreted this way. Is this legal? No, that's not legal. The landlord can't charge you for routine maintenance unless you agreed to it; the security deposit is for debts and damage to the leased property. As long as the carpets are as clean as when you moved in, minus reasonable wear and tear, cleaning them again the landlord's preferred way isn't your responsibility.  Its happened to me in every apartment I've been in regardless if i say ill clean then myself, so unfortunately i think it is. Im in ND tho state law could vary. But 100 isn't the worst deal for a carpet cleaner either, figure out your square footage and call around to see if you can get it for cheaper and ask the landlord of you can do it yourself, but bottom line it HAS to be done one way or another
