My elderly mother just died.  (Merciful, in a way - COPD is an awful condition.).  Her simple estate is divided between myself and two siblings.  We plan to sell her home (mortgage paid off) next spring.  My CPA says since the home won't be sold in the same calendar year as my mother's death, the proceeds from the home need to be reported on each of our beneficiaries' taxes in 2019 (divided by three), rather than my mother's final tax return.  We know the cost basis will be adjusted to the value upon her death, so there will be very little capital gains tax to pay.  Is my CPA correct, or is there a way to file an amended return for my mom's estate, or to file for an extension on her 2018 taxes, so the home's sale will be part of her final tax return?  Maybe I'm overthinking this, and having to report one-third of the home's sale on my taxes is not a big deal, since the sale price will essentially equal the cost basis. You could hold the property in probate until it’s sold if possible then file a return for the estate, likely the amount will higher overall tax wise unless the house is of a high value, in which case it wouldn’t matter just see which way is taxed less
