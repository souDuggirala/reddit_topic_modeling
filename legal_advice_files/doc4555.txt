 So i started a shopify account and there was a charge back and i had my canadian card on and for some reason it didn’t work so i put my us account on and they charged me 37.17$ for the charge back. no problem for me . problem is i wasn’t aware of the money owed and never received a call or even a notification regarding it, my bank contacted me about it and i owe over 900$ in fees because of them not contacting me. is there anything i can do because i don’t believe the 900$ is justified. thanks.
