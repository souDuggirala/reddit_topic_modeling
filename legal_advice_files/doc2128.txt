 Dec 8 2018 my parents bought a used car from a used car dealership for $4500. Two of their sellers told my parents verbally that the car had 1 month of engine transmission guarantee. If anything happens that we could go back to them and they would fix it for us. Well within 14 days the engine goes bad. We contact the dealer and they told us to take it back to them and we do so the same day. They take the car to a mechanic next door to them and they took a week to give us a diagnosis of the problem. Telling us that there was antifreeze leaking into the engine. A week later and still they do not want to help us fix the car. Next thing they mention it only has 15 days of engine and transmission guarantee. Again it broke down on us within the 15 day period. Now they are saying they canâ€™t fix it for free. They are also saying that we ran the engine hot. And that we still would have to pay $700-$800 to get the engine fixed. Is there anything I can do? Any help is appreciated.  They did not hand us written statement with the 1 month guarantee.  Do you have it in writing that you have a 1 month guarantee on the engine and trans?
