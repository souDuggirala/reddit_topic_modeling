 I was involved in a hit and run when a car rear ended me. Emailed video evidence from a dash cam to the officer and was told he may need to seize it as evidence. My questions are: 1. Do I have to comply? My concern is if I was speeding or rolled through a stop sign elsewhere in the video... something could come of it. 2. If I do hand it over, is it common to ask for immunity for any (unrelated) traffic infractions that may be on the dash cam? I don't want to over think things but then again I don't necessarily want to hand it over when the pertinent part of the video was uploaded to YouTube for their use. Thanks! This could be a totally innocent request where the detective wants to eliminate questions on the legitimacy of the source data....or it could be something entirely different, like a suspicion of you personally for other stuff unrelated to this accident. Either way there is no benefit to turning it over, and knowing the way those things record, this situation will resolve itself in a week or so. That was my assumption. I gave them the relevant video clips and thought that should be enough. I appreciate your input. Alarm bells should be going off. Never turn over any potentially incriminating evidence to police without a warrant. Tell them no and go about your business.
