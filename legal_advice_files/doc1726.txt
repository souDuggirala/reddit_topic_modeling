 Look I just really needed to sleep, the dogs kept yapping because the neighbours left them alone overnight with an approaching storm no less and I didn't know what else to do. Best part is the poor things were hungry AF (ate all my dogs chow in his bowl + more) and had no shelter from what I could see. These dogs constantly yip and yap everyday when the owners leave, this is the first time they've left them overnight. Am I fucked legally for doing this? Should I call the spca when I wake up to notify them of this incident? I'm notifying the body corporate of my apartment complex tomorrow because this shit is getting ridiculous now.  In the US you would be in trouble for stealing since dogs are considered property. Here you would report the situation to the police and/or animal control instead. I don't know that anyone here will be able to educate you on the law in South Africa though. Don’t take your neighbor’s property. Call animal control next time. I think that because dogs are considered property, that’s theft. Don’t know for sure though, especially if they were left alone and hungry.
