 I moved into a one bedroom apartment unit in Rancho Cordova, California in October. The lease signed was a month to month agreement. By the time November rolled around I was a little low on finances and decided to move two acquaintances in with me; they were not added to the lease nor were any bills placed in their name, no mail sent to them at the address. I moved out of this apartment on the 18th of January and had informed my landlord prior to leaving. A verbal agreement was established that I would vacate the premises by the 18th; however, two days after leaving I received a call from her saying that my previous roommates had broke back in to the apartment and are squatting. She refused to cooperate with the police in terms of having them removed from the premises; instead, she eventually gave them a three day notice after turning a blind eye for a few days. After realizing that these individuals have no intentions of leaving, she contacted me again prompting me with two options: return back to the apartment and remove them myself or face an eviction in my name. Is this something that I am still legally responsible for? TLDR Moved out of apartment, old roommates not on lease, squatting-- being evicted in my name
