 Hi there! Ive never had the need to post here until now so here it goes. I used to work for a fairly large pizza chain as a manager at one of their stores for about 8 months. Until me recently checking my pay stubs after leaving this position, it seems theyve sent $200 to "AL State Taxes". I LIVE and WORK in Florida. Is there anything that can be done about this..? Or am I just screwed Mistakes happen. Checking paystubs is how we identify others' mistakes. That said, scolding isn't helpful, so I'd recommend posting over on /r/tax. If you post over there (or reply here) please let people know if this income was paid to Alabama in 2018 or if any of it was prior to 2018. Assuming all 2018 but just checking. You want to get this sorted out before end-of-year, will be much easier.
