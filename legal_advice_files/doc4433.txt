 I want see a website that has bail amounts for each misdemeanor and felony. Try googling [county you're in] bail schedule I am sure there is a "usual" range (though that may be wide). But I don't think that anyone has ever collected the data into a website or anything.  Bail is determined by multiple factors, to include a defendant's criminal history and the nature of the offense at hand. There is no set amount.  Okay. Any range, right? No usual range? There is not one. Because bail is set in each individual case by a judge who reviews it and decides.
