 (Ohio)We work at a fast food restaurant and he answered a call last night from someone claiming to be an IRS agent. This person told him that our store was under a federal investigation for tax fraud and our general manager was counterfeiting money. Without telling anyone else in the store he took around 800 dollars out of the safe and used that money to buy prepaid cards and told the scammers the card numbers over the phone as they instructed him to do, claiming it helped with the investigation. What should his next step be after telling our general manager? Does he need to get a lawyer or call the police himself? Would offering to immediately replace the money in the safe help?  That person should be fired because they have no business being around money. This scam is as old as dirt. Your friend can report it to the police, but the money is likely gone. You can expect that your friend will be fired and possible reported to the police for theft.
