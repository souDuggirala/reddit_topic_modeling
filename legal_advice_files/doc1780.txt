 This morning I woke up to 25 cars in the parking lot that had windows busted. This has happened 2 other times since I moved in 3 months ago. We are really wanting to move to a new area where this is not an issue. Could I get out of the lease? If so, what steps do I take? Thanks! Thanks for the feedback! No. The apartment complex has zero control over crime that spills over onto their property, and therefore zero liability for crime that occurs on their property, outside of anything that may be guaranteed in your lease. Park 2-3 blocks away and enjoy the fresh air on your morning walks.
