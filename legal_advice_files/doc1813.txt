 We are located in Ohio. During enrollment period through work last year, my husband opened an FSA which was going to help pay for child care tax free. Well, we didn’t end up using it, at all. Not a cent. So now there’s over 1k sitting in this account and my husband’s employer is basically saying “too bad for you, there’s no way possible to get your money back”. I’m so confused. Can we not just pay a tax penalty on it and take what’s left? Is there anything at all that can be done? Uh yeah, that's the whole point of the program. Your husband had all that information at his fingers when he signed up. You have until March to submit claims for reimbursement. Did you have a babysitter or any daycare in 2018? And, you did have a dependent that is aged appropriately to need daycare? SOME employers have a 2.5 month extension (that covers even new expenses) and a $500 roll over option. I might double check on those and make sure someone isn't missing them in the fine print. All is not lost. Did you have qualifying expenses in 2018? If so, you have until at least 60 and probably 90 days to submit claims for those expenses.  I am not a lawyer. FSA funds are use it or lose it. However, many FSA plans do allow you to make claims up to mid-March of the following year (so, March 15, 2019 to file for reimbursement of 2018 expenses). Your husband should look in his plan documents for the "reimbursement deadline". Any money in an FSA that you do not use goes back to the employer. FSA contributions have always been subject to the “use it or lose it” rule. This is enforced by the IRS and isn’t up to your employer. Your employer may have a grace period for allowing you to spend some of last year’s money this year, but you can’t get the money back. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.  Sorry, but that is how dependent care FSA works. Use it or lose it.
