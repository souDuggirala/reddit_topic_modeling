Good day to anyone who reads my post, this is my first time posting :) 

So long story short there is a New Zealand court judgement on recovery of debt (has come into force). The debtor is a company located in Liechtenstein, therefore the judgment must be executed in Liechtenstein since all of debtor assets are in Liechtenstein.

My question is - what is the legal procedure on execution New Zealand court judgement in Liechtenstein ? Who should I address, basically what are the legal steps that must be taken to collect this debt in Liechtenstein if it is possible at all? 

I have read a couple of google search related sites and posts, however, I haven't come closer to any actual answer.

I thought maybe here is somebody from Liechtenstein, neighboring countries (Switzerland, Austria) or just a generally smart person/persons that could point me in the right direction.

I would appreciate any answer or comment on this subject, cheers ! :) 

&amp;#x200B; Yeah i know its a small country with around 30k people. Finding a lawyer is an option, however I was thinking of doing the procedure myself, just cant find it. Thanks for the link thou ðŸ˜Ž This appears to be the official website for lawyers in Liechtenstein, with a section for finding a lawyer in a specific area of practice: https://www.rak.li/en-us/b%C3%BCrgerservice/anwaltfinden.aspx

(Yes, I think that is a listing of every lawyer in the country, on one page. They have a population of approx 38,000 people.) Do not send people to that sub when they are obviously outside of the the UK.  Comment removed.   [removed] /r/liechtenstein/

very dead tho If you can find a Lichtenstein attorney, theyâ€™d be more suited to help. Is /r/Lichtenstein a sub? They get upset when people here direct people from other European countries there.  [removed]
