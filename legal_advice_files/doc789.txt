 Hi, I’m 17 years old in Ontario. I work at Tim Hortons on the weekends. They have me scheduled to work until 11pm then start the next day at 9am. I thought there was an 11 hour rest period rule, but my dad says it doesn’t apply to me for whatever reason. Can someone explain if my situation is an exception for whatever reason? Thanks.  Thank you very much for explaining simply. I am not good with this stuff.  [Here you go](). You must have 11 hours off of work _in each day_, not between each shift. The rules for inter-shift breaks are more complicated. Assuming you don't work more than 13 hours combined in the two shifts, you're only owed 8 hours' break between them. The 10 hours you're getting more than meets that.
