 My step father is a director of a government run agency, the employees have gone on strike against the union. This has resulted in them finding out where my family lives and they have been protesting outside their house for a few months now. This has escalated to them blocking my mother's vehicle from leaving the house by occupying the sidewalk. Is there anything we can do? They are incredibly careful to stand on the sidewalk with their signs, but it now means my mother has to leave home three hours earlier for work just to avoid them or have my brother (the only one of us within the province) help her leave. Due to my step dad work he travels a lot so it's my mother at home dealing with this... Isn't there anything I can do for them? Is there any way to deter them from protesting outside our house? It's a very small town, even then I'm surprised there isn't any media involved. I do hope it stays that way though, the last thing they need is to have even more people outside. Damn, so there's really nothing I can do then. Thanks for your help anyway, hopefully they stop for Christmas That doesn't sound right to me but ultimately that's a negotiating strategy decision and if your parents have decided to allow this to advance the negotiating interests of the agency then it isn't really a legal issue, it's something they are choosing to allow. Surely the agency has lawyers that your step dad can discuss this stuff with. I'm surprised I haven't seen this situation in the media. Right now they are worried that they will give them "ammo" against them once the negotiations begin but who knows when that will happen.  [removed] Has your mom tried calling the police? Generally it's legal to protest on public property and unions are usually given a pass for delaying people for short periods of time, but I doubt the police would allow them to confine her for three hours every morning in her driveway.
