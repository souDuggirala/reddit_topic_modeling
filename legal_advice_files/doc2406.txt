 I'm employed by a hospital, but work in a clinic attached to certain specialty. We work a lot with in-clinic patients and Tele-medicine. We make lots of phone calls during an average week. Our phone system was recently upgraded to an IP/Cisco based system, and through the friends I've made over the years, rumor is corporate has quietly instructed IT to record all phone calls. I understand that KY is a one party state, but if I'm giving out medical advice over the phone, do/will I have a duty to inform the patient? I am told a lot of private, personal information. Some non-medical (death in family, holiday plans, etc..) that I'm not sure they would want recorded were this true. Thank you for sharing your wisdom They had to inform you before they started recording. Putting such a clause in your employment conditions would also likely be valid. If it is true that all phone calls at work are being recorded, how long does the hospital have to inform us?  At least one person that is a party to a call must be notified if a call is recorded. If you are one-on-one with a client, either yourself or the client must know that the call is being recorded. If your employer were to issue a blanket memo to all employees saying that all calls are being recorded, that should suffice.
