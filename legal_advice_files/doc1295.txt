 Alright so just want to inform myself of some things here. So the story is my ex girlfriend and I have a 2 and a half year old daughter. I'm 21 and she is also and we both live in Ohio. We split up in July and were co-parenting flawlessly up until the beginning of this year. She doesn't make much money but I have a full time job that I make pretty decent money at. Anyway so like I said around New Year's we started fighting alot about basically everything and the shit is really starting to hit the fan now, she's talking to children's services about custody, child support, tax returns, the whole bit. I've just never been through any of this and am just looking for some advice on what to expect and also how I should go about things to make sure I stay squeaky clean in case I ever end up in front of a judge. I am trying to talk her down and keep things civil but it's not been easy and I'm sure I'm going to be able to. So yeah just whatever you got throw it at meüëç In the meantime, any communication with her needs to be in writing (text or email). Thanks I will most definitely do that looks like that's what it's come to You hire an attorney tomorrow. That is your next step to protect yourself and your visitation time
