 Hello, I started my current job as a seasonal position. At the end of the season they offered me to fill an office position that is full time. From my hire date to now, I have been working 40 hours a week or more for a year and 2 months but they still consider me “seasonal”. In order to get benefit and insurance I need to be full time. My boss says she needs to talk her boss for a few months now. I asked HR and they said to go through her, Is this legal, and what can I do to get my benefits?
