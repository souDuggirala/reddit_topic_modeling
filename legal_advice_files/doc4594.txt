 SO, long story short, one of my family members is a huge heroin addict. I have very little sympathy for him considering the years of stress and grief he has caused my family and Mother, but of course she still wants to do everything she can to help him. So after his most recent arrest and stint in jail (got out yesterday), he says he is ready to go to rehab.. only issue is he wants to go Canada and do Ibogaine treatment, but I am not sure he can get in. His rap sheet follows: Arrested but no charge filed for drug paraphernalia possession last year Arrested but no charges filed for felony possession of controlled substance (3 counts originally, then 1 tacked on a day later) a few days ago (all these charges have "NCF final" next Owes the IRS at least 30k, maybe more.. Had his license suspended for an unpaid negligent driving ticket (the ticket has since been paid and he is getting his license back) He does have a valid passport. So looking at his charges, the answer might be obvious to some of you. I just am not sure because he hasn't formally been charged or convicted on his two arrests. Anyway advice would be helpful, don't want to get his or my Mum's hopes up if this is a dead end. Thanks all.  Also FWIW, i know people who have done Ibogaine treatment as well, and they recommended it highly.  Thank for the assumptive and condescending response. I haven't seen nor spoke to him in 6 months. I would love to know how I am enabling him. My mother has had very, very little contact. We don't give him money. We don't rescue him or give him places to stay. If picking him up from jail and ushering him into a rehab (one that he would like, he isn't demanding anything) is enabling? Then fuck us i guess. I guess the second half kind of addressed my question - so thanks.
