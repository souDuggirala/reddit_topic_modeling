 We went to a mutual friend’s house last night. Her other boyfriend, though neither relationship is open. I told her to be good and not cheat on her current boyfriend. She does, and this guy isn’t an idiot, so he knows what’s up. I skip out during the act and go home. Hours later she realizes what’s up and blows up my phone, and I say her property is ready at the front door when she wants it. My mom called the police in case she shows up and causes a scene, but the fact is that she has no means to come back and get it. I really don’t want her to be homeless, but I’m starting to realize that I need to take care of myself first. So, this is legally grey territory maybe? She has no key and somehow can’t remember the garage code or even the freaking address.  Done. Thank you.  Easy. I already printed them out. Unfortunately, her phone is shut off.  I would make it clear that she’s welcome to return and will be let in should she arrive at your place, but that she needs to find her own transportation home. Move the boxes back into her room. Leave it at that and see what she wants to do. In the meantime, draw up her 30 days notice to vacate and read the link I sent you on the lawful eviction process. Deliver the notice to her either in person or via other accepted posting methods.  Oh shit, I thought I was doing a favor. Should I hang it all back up? I hate this because our spoken agreement was a few days until she finds a new place.   Sounds like an eviction attempt to me, and, I suspect, to a judge. You're clearly communicating that she is to leave the residence, that her stuff has been packed up as she is no longer welcome to reside there, and that it is ready for her to come get whenever. If she is still a tenant, then you had no right to box up her things.  She hasn’t been evicted. If she shows up I will let her in. I’m just not going to buy her a cab to come here.  This is not legally a grey territory. Legally she is a tenant whom you have illegally evicted (a misdemeanor in MN). Not only can your tenant successfully petition the court to be allowed back in, if she succeeds, a fine may be assessed to treble the damages (minimum $500). You really should delete your other post and follow the [law](). Your crappy decisions having negative consequences for you do not give you the right to make someone homeless in the middle of the MN winter. Thank you for posting an update!
