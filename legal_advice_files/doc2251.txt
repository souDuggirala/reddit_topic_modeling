 Hello, I had a question in regards to the unit manager/landlord I guess. The manager acts on behalf of the renting company. Today he sent a message saying he could pick up rent today or tomorrow. I texted him back that I had left the rent money on my counter right by the entrance. He said he’d pick it up while I was at work. When I came back he had left a letter reminding tenants that we cannot flush toilet paper or anything down the toilet. Then I went to my bathroom and he had been there. He left two huge ugly stickers that had been there prior to me moving in and that I had taken off because they’re unnecessary. I’m an adult and don’t need sticker reminders and these fucking stickers are also a pain in the ass to remove. My question now is if he’s allowed to do that? He was basically snooping and I don’t like that he was looking around without my consent and while I was not there. Is there anything I can do? Yes, it is  I would be more concerned about the state of plumbing in your unit than the stickers. Is it even a legal rental? Is be more concerned with the fact that you aren’t allowed to flush toilet paper down the toilet.  Wait.. You can't flush toilet paper?!?! Do you have to keep your poo paper in ziplocs?!?! What the hell?!? Sweetie you need to MOVE. Even the streets allow you to poop in peace.  You gave him permission to enter. He, acting on behalf of the owner, can place stickers on their toilets if they want.  You didn't include your location, but I can't think of any state where that would be illegal.
