 Hey guys, posted this over in Personal Finance and was told I might wanna come here. My apartment complex sent us a 3 day notice earlier this month. We didn't know why, because all of us living here paid our portion of the rent. According to the apartment we had insufficient funds in one account and they didn't pull the money we had in there. We had more than enough in the account which left us confused. We have the receipts saying we tried to pay it, and a bank statement that shows no attempt to pull the funds on thier part. We paid the rent after hounding them that we wanted it paid while they were trying to figure this out using a cashier's check. But its been awhile and the ISF fee is still on our account. We have a meeting this Friday with the property manager and was wondering what you guys had to say about it. The ISF fee they're trying to get is 175 dollars. The amount they claim they tried to pull is $777 and some change. We also got it in writing that the 3 day notice was canceled.
