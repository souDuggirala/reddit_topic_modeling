 I work as a software engineer for a consulting company. One of their clients is a very large company. A subsidiary of the very large company reached out to me for a job interview. Their reaching out to me had absolutely nothing to do with the relationship between my company and the very large company. To complicate matters, my consulting involves working with a DIFFERENT subsidiary of this very large company. I was offered a position after my interview. In my contract with my current company they say I may not go off to work for a client or customer of theirs. Is a subsidiary of my company still considered a client of theirs? I'd like to take the position but am worried about potential legal problems.
