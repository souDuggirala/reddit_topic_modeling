 I have attempted to reserve a car with Avis for my European trip on their website. Entered all the information including credit card and hit submit. The web page went blank and did not respond. After 4 minutes closed the page and did it again with same result. Ended up renting with someone else. Two months later I found 2 charges of $770 for the rental that never completed. I have not received any confirmation emails and had no idea that reservation gone through. Unfortunately I've paid my credit card bill without going through it and filing dispute with credit card didn't yield anything. After numerous conversations with USA Avis customer service I've been refunded one of the two charges (they have passed on my request to Avis in Poland). As for second charge, Avis customer service said they can't do anything and that I have to speak to Poland Avis customer service directly. I've tried calling and emailing with no success. Can I take Avis to small claims court in US?
