I've read a lot of posts over the years about parents of teens who got pregnant and refused the option to put the child up for adoption or abort it. 

These parents, in my opinion, rightfully felt a large and unfair pressure put on them. They were  being legally forced into more responsibility. 

My question is, could the two custodial parents terminate their parental rights, placing the teen I to the foster system or anything like that? If not, could they legally forcefully emancipate the child? 

Obviously these questions depend on age, so 13-17 being the range as 12 is tween and ar 18 you can kick them out.

In forethought, I am aware of how cold these measures seem but I am very averse to having children and can sympathize with a person being forced into parenting.
