 Our pipes in our upstairs bathroom busted Saturday morning due to a freeze. My roommate is one of our landlord's handy man so he knew what to do to get it to stop before flooding downstairs too much. Landlord had his plumber come in Saturday did a quick fix. He didn't check it after putting a new pipe in left. That night we went to take a shower noticed the actual mechanism that controls the water in the shower is broken too making us unable to use the shower. This is the only shower in our house. He told us he'd have his guy come in on Sunday but he never showed up. He then said Monday he'll be there. We just texted him he said not till 7:30am on Wednesday. We live in a duplex for us to turn off our water, it turns off the neighbors as well (turn off valve runs through theres then half of ours). If the water is turned on, the shower runs water through the handle spout none stop. The three of us have not been able to shower since Friday night. If we run the water to use our sinks toilets then the shower runs none stop. Do I just have to suck it up till Wednesday or can I at least ask for a discount on our rent?
