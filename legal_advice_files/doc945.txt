 So I was caught speeding in WV (I am a resident FWIW) by a local (town) PD officer and I was ticketed for a moving violation, but it was listed as violating the local municipal speeding ordinance and not the state law. I've already plead no contest and paid the ticket, but I'm wondering -- since I was ticketed for violating a municipal ordinance and not a state law do I still get points on my license (the ticket was for less than 11 mph over so it would fall under "all other moving violations" and carry 2 points)?
