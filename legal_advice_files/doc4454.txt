 Recently my college had a mandatory football game that was scheduled when all official on campus religious organizations were allowed to meet. No students were allowed to leave the game/ go to the religious meetings at all. The administration forcibly cancelled all religious activities for that day. Are there any laws in South Carolina or nationally that would prevent the college from restricting religious meetings/ not allowing students to attend due to 'mandatory' events? This seems to me like an infringement on religious rights and should not be allowed.  My point is, if they're doing it for all groups, then there's no issue.  I think it is appropriate for them to prioritize the activities of students during special events. They are allowed to compel students to participate in group activity. They aren't saying students can't have religious groups or meetings, they said that you can't have meetings when you really ought to be watching the Buccaneers get destroyed. The issue isnt discrimination, but that religious meetings weren't allowed to take place. Im curious if that would qualify as restricting religious freedom. If they didn't let anyone leave for non-religious meetings, I don't see it as a discrimination issue.  Its a public college. Also its a senior military college but idk if that changes anything. For starters, public or private college?
