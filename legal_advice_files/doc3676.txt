 Just recently found out that over the last 5 years that my fellow coworkers and I have been lied to about contracts being signed that ensure our job security. The last contract between my employer and the company we do business with ended 5 years ago and we were informed multiple times about the contract being renewed. The most recent "signing" was over half a year ago and we were told that the contract is extended by 4 years and our team was locked at 22 people. A month ago they laid off 11 of the 22. Then a couple weeks ago we found out there was no contract in place and that our positions are all in serious jeopardy. I feel as if upper management knew we were worried about job security and knowingly deceived us in to believing our positions were secure so they told us the contract was resigned to ensure we wouldn't look for other employment. I know I would have been looking for something else this whole time if i knew our job security was in the danger it is in. My question is... What (if any) laws has my employer broken? And, if so, do I have any leverage against them in the case we also get laid off?
