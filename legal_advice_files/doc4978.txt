 I hired a law firm to argue my case for what was originally a speeding ticket for 20mph over the posted limit (would've been a 6-point speeding violation). They contacted me and informed me that they were able to reduce it to a "2 point non-speeding (non-moving) violation". However I'm not clear on what this actually means. So I guess my questions are: What exactly does a 2 point non-speeding violation entail? Is there a fine, and does this mean that I've been convicted/found guilty? I'm assuming the 2 points count towards the max 11 per 18 months, but after these 18 months have pasted, would that mean that these 2 points will come off my record? Also, will this ticket remain on my record forever? Thanks for your help. I've tried searching this on my own, but all I've come up with are speeding violations that are 2 points or texting violations that are 2 points. I just want to make sure that this is a deal that I should accept. Okay so I was actually mistaken when I said it was a non moving violation. My lawyer says it's a "non speed" violation. Is that still the same thing as a non moving violation? If not, how is it different? Yes, you're getting a good deal here.  -speeding violation entail? A 2 point non-moving violation. Exactly what it says. Far better than a moving violation. 've been convicted/found guilty? Typically yes, and it means you've plead down to this and been found guilty of the non-speeding violation. 'm assuming the 2 points count towards the max 11 per 18 months, but after these 18 months have pasted, would that mean that these 2 points will come off my record? Yes it will come off after the 18 month term. No, NYS only has serious convictions remain on your driver abstract forever. Even DWI's come off.
