 My sister got bought herself a very expensive Gucci belt for her birthday and found out it was a bit short so she took it to a shoe repair place who said they would be able to shorten it. They repair shop ended up ruining it and after they cut it too short the just piece they cut back on and said they can’t do anything about it. She has been to other shops to fix thing like expensive watches that were too short and many shop would refuse to fix it because they didn’t want to be held liable. Can I do something about this issue? That’s typo I mean to say it was too long and when she wanted it shorten the measured how much they needed to cut it and ended up cutting it wrong It was too short so she wanted it to be shortened? That makes no sense. Apparently they were doing what she wanted so she's likely out of luck. Next time just return or exchange the belt. Well, then likely she can try taking them to small claims court. He didn't break any laws.  Alright thanks for the response, do you know what law he violated? Yes. She can sue them.  No she said she didn’t Did she sign any paperwork before the alteration?
