 My friend was buying an Apple Watch from someone via twitter and after sending $200, he blocked her. Apparently he has a history of scamming ppl. Can she report him, and to who? Contact back? or Zelle support? Zelle How was the money sent? She can attempt to reverse the transaction but it's unlikely she can really do anything.
