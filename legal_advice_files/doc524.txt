 Not for me, but a friend asked me what she should do and I told her I knew a group that might be able to help. Essentially, my friend works in rural Idaho and they misplaced the “.” on her last paycheck. It should’ve been $74.00 but they paid her $740.00. What’s her liability/responsibility here and what should she do? She must return the money. Think of it this way, if you paid too much for a bill, you would want your money back, right? The same is true for the employer. And the law is on the side of the person or organization that overpaid.  She should return the money. It's not hers, her employer can retrieve it w/o her assistance, and for the trouble they might fire her.  She should expect to pay the money back.
