 I got pulled over for having my tail lights out, the cop says that if i show the court that i have it fixed, they will dismiss it (most likely). I looked up the cause of my tail lights being out and it’s a simple fuse replacement. how can i show the courts that i’ve fixed the issue if i did the repair myself?  Bring your receipts for the lights and a picture of them in working order.  Take video or pictures of the lights working, have a local cop write a statement that they are now working, and I'd also hold on to the receipts of anything you used to repair it.  You can take the ticket to your local police station and have an officer sign off on it, after you show them that the light is fixed. From there you jyst file the ticket with the appropriate court to have it done with. Your particular court's procedure for the latter can usually be found on their website, which should be on the ticket itself.
