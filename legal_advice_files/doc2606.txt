 The other day when I was on my way to college, I was going too fast on a curve I hit speed limit sign my spun out and then left becauae I had a test later on that day. I never called the police. I'm wondering if I have to call the police or anything or report it at the precinct. What are the odds of me getting away with that and not be affected by this.
