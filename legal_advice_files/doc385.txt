 I changed my name recently. There is a rule in my state that says I can get a NEW birth certificate if that is included in a name change court order. By default, the state amends the record and prints exactly what was amended at the bottom (i.e. the old name). So I just downloaded the default forms from my state and added a sentence at the very end of my order under "Ordered/Decreed" saying "Vital Records shall make this change by creating a new certificate in accordance with (statute). The certificate shall not be marked as amended" and got it signed by a judge. Lo and behold. I got copies of my certified birth certificate in the mail today and my old name is printed at the bottom of the certificate. It's going to be Monday before I can reach anyone. I'm concerned because there is absolutely no way that vital records could have missed that line at the bottom of the court order, at least I don't think so anyway. I even have an email from one of the senior staff that told me if I don't want the record marked amended, I need to just include that in the order. I'm concerned that something got screwed up because the rest of the order talks of "amending" the record, then at the very end says that they should make this change by issuing a new certificate. I left that language as-is then put the provision in on the bottom because "amend" means "change". Perhaps it is just a matter of a phone call to clear things up, and maybe one of the staff simply just made a mistake. But if they refuse, do I have any legal recourse?
