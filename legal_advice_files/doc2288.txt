 I’ve suspected that I may be depressed for a while now, but it’s been a struggle bringing up to my doc. One of my concerns is that a diagnosis may interfere with one of the few things I enjoy in life: hunting and plinking at the range. Especially with new gun laws coming down the pipe every year in CA seems like, I’m scared that I may never be able to purchase another rifle or bullet. Mind you, I’m not feeling any desire or compulsion to harm myself or others. I’m also worried about the diagnosis popping up if I ever try to apply for certain jobs in the future. Is there any risk?  That is something which makes sure the doctor does not release information to a third "person" about the patient as far as I know. Doctors are actually obligated to report medical conditions which might affect the population to the relevant authorities so that restrictions on driver licenses, gun purchases etc can be put in place. I fee like “should” should be more reassuring, but thanks for the response all the same.  NAL but doctor/patient confidentiality should protect you.
