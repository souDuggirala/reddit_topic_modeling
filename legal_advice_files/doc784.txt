 So I received a letter from a debt collector who purchased an account in my name from Chase. I sent a letter requesting that the debt be validated. 3 weeks later (today) I received a letter in the mail from Chase card services. The letter does NOT include any information on the amount of debt, interest, charges, etc. All it includes is the data from my original application for a Chase card in 2013 - SSN, name, address, etc. No information on the finances of the card. Where do I go from here? The debt has not been validated by Chase, from my understanding of the requirements. Location: Indiana, USA If a debt buyer purchased your debt from Chase, then Chase is no longer involved because it no longer owns the account. Are you sure the debt has been purchased by a debt buyer? Check Chase’s entry on your credit report. If the debt has been sold, Chase’s entry will show “sold” or “transferred”...something to that effect.
