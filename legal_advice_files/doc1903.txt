 I'm not sure what's important to mention, but I hired a freelance developer for website services, and we are disputing over a retainer clause where he wanted me to notify him a month ahead of time when I no longer needed his services (or else continue paying the retainer). We signed a contract over email but the cancellation clause was not in the contract. The contract instead linked to a Terms of Agreement on his website, which did contain the cancellation clause. I assume that means I'm liable for it, but wanted to check -- am I? I am in Washington, D.C. and he is in San Francisco.
