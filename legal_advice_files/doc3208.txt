 I was issued a ticket with a mandatory court appearance, on January 15, 2018. Is this simply something regarded as a mistake and I have to contact the city to reschedule it? Thanks in advance. Number three wouldn't be a great defense, since they didn't show up on that date, either. It seems like it would hurt OP more than the prosecution. I'm picturing this conversation: "Did you show up for your court date in January of 2019?" "No." "Why not?" "Because the summons said January of 2018." "Okay, did you show up in January of 2018?" "No." "Why not?" "Because it was in the past and was obviously a typo." ...  You may want to also call the Judge's clerk and clarify. It does seem like an obvious mistake, but it can't hurt to call them and confirm. Gonna go with choice #1. Thank you sir. You have three choices. 1.) Show up for the date that you know it was supposed to be. 2.) Call and get clarification and show up on the date they tell you to. 3.) Don't show up, wait for them to issue a warrant for failure to appear, and then try to use this as a defense to the judge on your new court data after possibly being arrested. Your call how you want to handle it.
