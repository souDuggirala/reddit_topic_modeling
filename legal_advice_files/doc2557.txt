 I don’t know if i’m in the right place to ask this but i am just curious because of things like recreational marijuana becoming legal in states regardless of federal law. I don’t fully understand the supremacy clause and am confused as to how things would work in the instance that guns are heavily federally regulated in the future. /r/legaladviceofftopic
