 There is a car in our parking lot at work that has stayed for months and nobody has come to pick it up. At what point is this considered abandoned property, if at all? Is there a path to pursue ownership of the vehicle? The police have expressed disinterest in dealing with it as it's not their problem and no other person has come forward to collect it. Any ideas? This is in Ohio. You will need to have it towed, then at that point it becomes the towing company's problem. Ohio does not allow property owners to apply for title to a vehicle abandoned on their property. Only a towing company may do so. [removed] [removed] No, not really. Best thing to do is call a towing company and have it towed. Is the car parked on public property or private property?
