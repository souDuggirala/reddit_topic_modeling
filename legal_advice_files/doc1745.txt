 He was at work and first off had to abandon his car and leave to save his clients, it impossibly survives but has some melting problems. He also got 100% abandoned by his supervisor, and staff. He worked 24 hour shifts for at least nine days (allowed to sleep); wasn’t provided other staff. Towards the end, before he had a mental breakdown they said they were only paying him 16 of 24 hours and when they offered him 3 hours or so of relief he would only sleep in the room with the client (his only bed). He was not right... i don’t think he understood what was going on. He paid for his clients food, medications, and got clothing. He at least got reimbursed for that. But he is missing at least 72 hours of pay, and his car is underivable because he saved his client. Thank you! Then he needs to file a wage complaint with the department of labor, and they'll make a determination. I corrected the statement in another comment, sorry. He works ihss and takes care of disabled people. He had to care for his because he could t care for himself. So he was working 24 hours. He had to provide food, medication management, diabetic management, took him to the hospital, find replacement items. He was with him 24 hours for minimum 9 days (i can’t remember and he’s gets very stressed when he talks about it). The company didn’t provide any respite workers for him until he was beyond understanding what they were telling him.  He can file a wage complaint if he was working and didn't get paid. The details are unclear if he was actually working, though. This is difficult to understand, but it doesn't really matter. If he is having an issue with his employer, the answer is to speak to a plaintiff-side employment lawyer. He also could file a wage complaint.
