 So I flooded my apartment and it’s 100% my bad— and I’m a terrible liar so everyone knows what happened. The water left damage to both my apartment and the day care center (huge chain in Seattle) under me. The thing is— my renters insurance had lapsed and they are telling me I am 100% liable for the cost of repairs. So far, they’ve hired someone to inspect the damage (they didn’t tell me this until they showed up) and I have to pay for that too. The building manager won’t talk to me. I live in a very large apartment community in Seattle. I don’t know what steps to take to make sure that I do everything in my favor. You will likely get a big bill, and have to pay it. If you can't pay it all at once, negotiate payments, or try to negotiate a smaller amount, although you would have to come up with that cash up front. You will probably end up negotiating with the other insurance companies, presumably the complex and day care have their own insurance. They may not go after you, if you are totally broke, but they might. You don't have any control over what kind of inspection or repairs they do. Unfortunately this will be an expensive lesson for you. Your insurance lapsed. You likely just caused a lifetime financial commitment.
