 I posted this before in R/LegalAdviceUK but this board seems more active. Joined a graduate UK role where I signed an agreement stating if I left I pay back £9000. £6000 of training and £3000 of 'potential earnings'. I received subpar training inside the office where for six-weeks I was basically lectured at by existing employees. Please note that I did not receive any professional qualifications as a result of my time here. I have also not been placed on a project at all since joining the firm and completing training in August. Anyways, last week I had a meeting where it was evident I no longer wanted to be there. They took it upon themselves to get their lawyers to begin writing up a 'repayment plan' - something I didn't agree to. I've not handed in my notice or anything of the sort. I heard off record from someone that the fees they want are for paying the in house trainers (who already work here) and for the 'free' accommodation provided. What are my options?
