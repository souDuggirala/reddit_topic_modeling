 I've done my fair share of google searches and from what I've seen I dont think I have any legal obligation. Basic story is my ex and I moved into a place with her parents. Only her parents are leasees. I was listed as an occupant. We split up and I moved out. Now her parents are threatening to sue me. Yes, if they are arguing that you owe for the entirety of the lease then you would need access to the unit for the entire lease (provided you do pay) Yes, the leasing agent can remove you, but the other tenant would need to agree.  So lets say hypothetically she thinks I legally owe her for the rest of the lease. Wouldn't that also mean I have the right to move back in? I wonder if the leasing agent can just take me off completely? No. I actually paid the majority of the deposit too. I was only there for a month. They can try to take you to small claims court. It will be up to the judge if you hold liability for the entire lease. Do you currently owe them any money for the time you lived there? I think the entire lease? Not sure. I was only paying $500/month and have been out for 2 months. Lease is for a year. What rent are they threatening to sue you for? Past or future? Not on paper, but I was paying to her parents. Did you have an agreement in which you were paying rent?
