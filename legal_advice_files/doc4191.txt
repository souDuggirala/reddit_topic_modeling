 My aunt (a Pole) died suddenly last Sunday and we are supposed to give her a funreal this friday but they don't want to give us her death certificate. My grandma (lived in Germany for about 18 years) was trying to get it for the last few days but they supposedly can't understand what she is saying. Apparently they don't really want to talk with my grandpa (who is a German) either. They want us to give them birth certificate of my aunt's children, her certificate of marriage, divorce, etc. However when I looked up online all someone needs to get death certificate is to prove your identity and legal right to obtain the document. How can we deal with this situation?  Firstly, I am sorry for your loss. In Belgium, when somebody dies, a doctor will issue first death certificate (I think not the document you are looking for), which needs to be given the administration of the city where the death occurred (usually, by the funeral company providing the burial services) and the administration will provide a few death certificates that will be useful to inform other administrations, companies... of the death of the person. If a funeral company is involved, I would check with the funeral company. It is one of the services they provide. Otherwise, I would check with the person who went to the city's administration where your aunt passed away. (assuming it is the same as in Belgium) Otherwise, I would try getting another person go with your grandparents to help them, if only because it is a very difficult moment for them. I was told my grandma (who is my aunts mother) already proven her legal right with her id and legal documents about my aunt she owned and they are still asking for more. :/ Yes, she is her mother. NAL but I think they are asking you for these documents in order to prove your legal right to obtain the document. How do you prove it otherwise? Is your grandmother her next-of-kin?
