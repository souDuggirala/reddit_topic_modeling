 My grandmother passed away recently. Grandpa is still alive and well. The entire family is fighting over their possessions as if they both just died. Grandpa has been declared competent. But people are telling me that the state is going to take his stuff? Trucks, a house, a business. Is someone just blowing a bunch of smoke out of their butt? I would think that since he is well and competent that this would not even be a possibility. Thank you so much for your answer. I am going to ask some more questions about all of it. I believe the issue is that one of my aunts really wants everything (doesnt hide it either) has been raising hell and calling authorities and trying to serve people for abuse. There was a wellness check done even but they said he was competent and obviously saw no abuse. He worked hard for all of that stuff and I swear if he ends up living off $300 a month for the rest of his life like I am being told, im going to lose a lot of faith in humanity.  I'm sorry for your loss. IANAL. The state is not going to just come take his stuff unless he owes back taxes, is being foreclosed on, or is involved in some kind of civil or criminal asset forfeiture process. His wife passing away doesn't mean he doesn't get to keep his property. Who is the executor of your grandmother's estate (would assume your grandfather)? That's the person who needs to get in front of the greedy relatives and tell them to sit down and shut up. In all likelihood, most everything now belongs to your grandfather, but if there are divorces or step-children or pre-nups or trusts, things get complicated.
