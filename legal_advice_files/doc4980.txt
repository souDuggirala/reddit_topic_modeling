  I run a social group with other women for yoga, a tran is asking to join, however we took a vote and said no as we do not feel comfortable, because of the type of activity. We are not being rude, if it was a reading group then its fine, but yoga is a no for privacy reasons.

[removed] Someone correct me if I’m wrong, but wouldn’t it still be illegal as that wouldn’t be a single characteristic? IE They’re a women’s group, so they would need to allow a trans woman in, or they could be a cis-gendered group but they would need to allow men in.  [removed] Private social groups are generally exempt from the equality act. The law hasn't quite reached the point where it forces you to be friends with someone or socialise with them. The provisions in the law are for places like private golf clubs, nightclubs, gyms, etc that have a formal membership structure. One of the examples given in explanatory notes for the Equality Act 2010 supports this, it reads "A book club run by a group of friends which has no formal rules governing admittance or whose membership is less than 25 is not an association for the purposes of this Part." Even if you are considered an association you may still be legally allowed to refuse a transgender person under Schedule 16, Part 1 of the act ([Single Characteristic Associations](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/schedule/16/crossheading/single-characteristic-associations)) because you are restricting membership to persons who share a protection characteristic (i.e. you share the protected characteristic of sex).  People can sue/be sued for damn near anything. Whether they'd win or not is the question, and I can't answer that. And as much as I hate to reassure you that your bigoted, ignorant actions probably won't have consequences (for you), they probably won't. Because she (yes, SHE) faces bullshit like this every day of her life and can't possibly have the time or the resources to sue everyone who dishes it out. INAL, you can probably refuse them if this is just a “social group” and not an actual place of business, but you are a piece of shit human for doing so and I am glad that you are sparing them of your disgusting, bigoted presence.
