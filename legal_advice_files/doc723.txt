 I was with my ex for about five years and during that time used their bank account as my own. My direct deposit went to that account, all household expenses were paid from it, etc. My name was never on the account. Being perfectly honest here, I was abusive and part of that abuse was keeping their bank card and checks from them. I would spend whatever I wanted from the account, signed the majority of checks, and controlled all the money that came into the house. I never talked with my ex about finances, budgets, or ever told them how much money was being spent month to month. They were completely in the dark about the majority of what the account was being used for, and not because they lacked interest, but because I outright refused to speak with them about it. Since we've broken up, my ex has reclaimed their ownership of the account and reported many transactions as fraud, some of which I know have been refunded to them. I'm worried that they may be able to report everything as fraud, including money spent from the account that technically came from my direct deposits. So, my question is: If I knowingly set up direct deposit on a bank account, without permission, that wasn't mine, does it still belong to me? If not, how badly do I need a lawyer? You gave your money to her the moment you deposited in to her bank account. You should change that so you don't continue to give her money.
