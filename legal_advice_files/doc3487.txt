 I recently moved into an older house. We had a home inspection done before purchasing it. This was performed in June 2017. I noticed the damage a few months ago, as we've only been living in part of the house while working to renovate it. It doesn't appear to be active, though I'm not sure yet as I haven't gotten to calling an exterminator to come and check it out. My question is does the home inspector have any liability for stating that "No Visible evidence of wood destroying insects was observed" on the Wood Destroying Insect Inspection Report? Does it make any difference if an exterminator could identify this damage as old? This would have certainly affected my purchasing decisions on the house and the offer we made.

I guess proving it happened before is going to be difficult, I'll find out from the exterminator if it's even possible to identify a time frame. If the damage was not that noticeable, and they didn't notice it, then at best you could try to get you money back from the inspection. But you'd need to prove that the damage happened before the inspection. Most (if not all) home inspectors have a limitation of liability clause written in to their pre-inspection contract/agreement. You'd need to consult that agreement to see what the inspector is and is not liable for.
