 I just received a hysterical call from my best friend (hes 24), he received a call from his grandad that his mother had shot his dad. He has zero information. Beyond his dad being in surgery but no idea what hospital. His mom is in police custody and he has no idea where his 12 year old sister is. I advised him to call the police and identify himself to hopefully get the information on where his dad is and to locate his sister. What's mostly likely happened to his sister and what's going to happen. Next? [removed] School is out on winter break. So far hes located her and shes being picked up by a family friend. Not sure where she is exactly but shes been found so far. I'm certain she's still at the school. This just happened.  Already headed there. 6 hours out but I'll be there. My friend is 24 and does not live with his parents. I thought schools may be out but maybe she is still in school Just be support for your friend.  The sister may be in the custody of social services...or in school. You can also try calling local hospitals and asking if there is a patient there by the father's name. 's going to happen next? How old is your friend?
