 So I have been living in this apartment building, in Western New York, for a little over a year now. Around last October I noticed few of the washers and dryers located in the building started to malfunction and not work properly (i.e dryers wouldnt dry no matter the load/ would keep spinning when the door is opened, and the washers would randomly trip the surge protector/breaker in the wall outlet midwash.) To give an idea of the situation, the building has ~20 units, many of which are 2 bedroom. Of the estimated 40 or more people living in the building, there are only 3 washers and 3 dryers. 1 dryer doesn't work, and 2 of the washers constantly trip. For a few weeks I avoided using the coined laundry on site and would use a friend's place or a laundromat. I notified my landlord "Will" of the these problems, and a few others, when I was planning to move out. He made no comment at the time. Fast forward a couple months and there is still no change. And due to changes in my personal life, I'm still living here, and the on site laundry has become my main option. I have talked to other tenants about the issue and they confirm experiencing the same problems. There's even an elderly woman who uses a metal rod from a hanger to reset the outlet for the washers, as she cant reach. One day doing laundry, I notice there is a sign in the laundry to call for service, I call and it turns out to be "Will's" brother who is actually managing the property. I tell him the same issues and he says he'll have someone come take a look and figure it out. That was a month ago. I'm wondering, legally, what are my options to fix this if any? Am I just wasting my time complaining about it? My lease has a clause regarding my ability to refuse paying rent if an issue is not fixed in a timely manner but I am unsure if this falls under it.  Does your lease mention access to the washer and dryer? If it doesn't they're there as a courtesy, and they don't have to fix them at all.
