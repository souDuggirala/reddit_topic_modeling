 It is a used $60 watch, i think this one [=dp\_olp\_all\_center?ie=UTF8 condition=all](=dp_olp_all_center?ie=UTF8 condition=all) It has no name on it, so I want to clean it and give it to my mom for christmas, I am 14 so I cannot afford anything big, and I really want to give her something really special. Thank you for any advice.  From a legal standpoint, there's three classifications of property in this regard. There's lost property, mislaid property, and abandoned property. At common law, someone who finds lost property has the superior title to it, except for the rightful owner of the property. If they come along and want it back, it's their's. If property is mislaid, meaning unintentionally left behind, there's genuinely a duty to give that item to the property owner to see if they can find the rightful owner. Abandoned property at common law is fair game. Having said that, there may be a statute out there depending on where you live that imposes a duty on you to try to return certain types of property and certain classifications. Some places have a lost and found system where you turn over the item and wait a few days to see if someone comes and gets it, then you can keep it. This watch likely falls into either lost or misplaced property. I don't know if your subway system has a lost and found or not. From a practical standpoint, it likely doesn't matter. No one is going to come knocking down your door for a $60 dollar watch. But, from a moral standpoint, you're giving this watch to your mom for a Christmas gift. Do you think she'd really enjoy the gift knowing you didn't try your best to find the rightful owner? What if the watch was somebody's gift to their mother?
