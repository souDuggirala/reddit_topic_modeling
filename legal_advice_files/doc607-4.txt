Basically, my roommate and I had a falling out and his behavior is extremely erratic. He already committed credit card fraud using my payment information today. I don't know what he might do next... I did sell him ecstasy that I bought from someone else a while back. If he decides to show that to the authorities, will I get into any trouble?
