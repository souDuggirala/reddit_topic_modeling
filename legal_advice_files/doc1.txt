 Just broke uo with my girlfriend today. I asked her to leave my apt within 2 days bc Im no longer happy in the relationship. Eventually she started screaming and saying things that our neighbirs don't need to hear. I asked her niceky to stop yelling multiple times before i stood up and started yelling myself. She ended up pushing me and she stuck her hand in my face. When her hands almost knocked my glasses off my face i slapped her wrist away from me. Now she has her mom here yelling about calling the cops after she leaves. Ive never been in any kind of trouble with the law, her name is not on the lease and she laid her hands on me first. Am I fucked? Comment wasnt removed. You can be if she reports it to the police. Regardless of your separation now, if she reports the incident it can be view as DV. Well shes already left after the fiasco, shes returning later to get the rest of ger things. I just wanted to know if Id be in any trouble for slapping her hand out of my face. Since she has been staying there 4-5 months, she has established tenancy(and you are her landlord to this effect). As such, she must be offered 30 to leave. I also live in Ohio Roughly 4 or 5 months How long has she been staying there, and what is your location? She has been staying here but her name is not on the lease and she didnt oay a single bill Was your girlfriend visiting your apartment, or does she stay there? Unless you left a mark on her, or it was video-taped somehow, cops wont do a thing about this. Youâ€™re probably in the clear, but now you know how they play, so...be cautious.
