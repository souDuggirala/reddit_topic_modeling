 I wanted to buy an item from Facebook Market. Agreed with the seller for a upfront pay and posting (naive, yet his profile was ok - relationship, kids, legit pictures) Got his BANK DETAILS and his MR's (fake or real, I dunno now). His phone number. Paid and never get the package / item. No contact with him since week. Facebook is doing nothing. POLICE is doing nothing. Report on Action Fraud - idle. What can I do ? I know his real name, he has many fake FB accounts (selling same item again). I know where he is about (city name). Got loads of screenshots. What I can do ?! I saw it. It's to risky to prove it, and I don't have exact address of the frauder. One of his FB friends said he might be homeless now. [removed] Read [this](). It should lead you in the right direction.  Is this ok for a small claim ? Only proof for court I have is our messages (phone, messenger) and my bank statement.  Sue him in small claims or write it off as a learning experience not to pay up front for things like this.
