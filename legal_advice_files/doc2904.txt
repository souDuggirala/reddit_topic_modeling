 I am immigrating to Canada to live with my longterm SO and I just got my FBI record back and am not sure what some of these things mean. I had 2 DUI's, one when I was a minor, one as an adult and some issues with keeping up with community service/probation stuff (stupid kid with no guidance, so yeah). All of this is over a decade old but I am confused as to what some of these mean... or how I can get more information on them from the county in question? NCIC Offense Code 5005 - Contempt of Court (I was never held in contempt, I was always nice and did everything the judge did... minus above some of the stuff with probation) NCIC Offense Code 5012 - Probation violation (I didn't finish something in time I think?) NCIC Offense Code 4199 - "liquor" NCIC Offense Code 5404 - Juvenile DUI Please help!  You may have been charged with contempt alongside the probation violation. Contempt is what they charge you with for failing to obey a judge's lawful order.  You can be charged with contempt for breaching court orders. For example not doing community service (as far as I am aware that is) The most recent was 13 years ago, however my Canadian immigration lawyer is requesting more information about all of these and I am not sure where to get it from. We are only 2 documents away from submitting the application. How long ago was this? How far are you into the immigration process?
