 My husband is an alcoholic and I’m tired of the promises that he will stop. Is always the same thing, every single time. I am an immigrant though and I have my permanent Resident Card interview in February, I don’t want to be with him anymore, I’m being miserable, I also don’t want to go back to my country, what can I do?  Yes. He has 2 DUIs, one is from 2 years ago that he still can’t drive because his DL is suspended from that, today also he drank the entire day and drove without a DL and drunk. Does he have any DUIs
