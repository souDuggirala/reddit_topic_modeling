 Sorry if this is a dumb question. I’m just trying to understand the legalities of car financing. During the period in which I’m paying off the loan, is my name on the title? Or, is the title only signed over to me once the loan is paid off? It’s the former, right? Am I correct in thinking that there’s a title with my name on it in my lender’s filing cabinet?  That process is correct but who holds the title Is all dependent on if your state is a title holding state.  The lender holds a Security Interest Filing. You have the title. It is titled in your name. The SIF is the lien recorded with the state. That’s how it works in Maryland.  I’m not sure about the specifics on that end. You could be right, but I don’t remember getting a title when I bought a new car with a lender.  Hmm...I thought I understood the process, but now I’m not sure. Here’s how I thought things worked: The seller signs the title over to me. A new title is created by the DMV which lists me as the owner. This title states that there is a lien on the car from the lender. The lender holds this title until I payoff the loan. Once they receive payment, they notify the DMV. A new title is created which shows that there are no liens. This title is then mailed to me. Have I accurately described the process? Or, have I gotten something wrong?  Your name shouldn’t be on the title until you own the vehicle, your lender and you would have to do a transfer of title through DOL.  Sorry, I’m just trying to make sure I follow. Let’s say I’m able to visit my lender’s office and pull my title out of their filing cabinet. Would I see my name listed as the owner? Or, would my lender be listed as the owner?  You are the registered owner but the vehicle belongs to lender until it is paid off. So tickets and such go to you, but they technically own the rig.
