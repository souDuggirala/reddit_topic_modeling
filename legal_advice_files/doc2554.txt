 I moved to California in January 2018. I ended up applying to and starting grad school here at SDSU in fall 2018. I just filed for resident status for tuition purposes, but was denied. They said I met the requirements for physical presence and financial independence, but I was denied because I did not meet the requirements for "residential intent." I do not have a state drivers license, local bank, or voter registration, which they say I need. I did present my library card and medicaid card, which I thought would be sufficient. They said I can file for appeal. How can I prove my residential intent? I'm struggling financially and have been bouncing from apartment to apartment, which is why I have failed to get these ducks in a row.  Apparently you obtain a state driverâ€™s license, open a bank account, and/or register to vote.
