 It’s not much but it is to me, some dude who my friend knew (or thought so) showed me some software that we both thought I would like. He hooked me up and I paid $15 on PayPal friends and family (I know) He blocked me but I still have his email from the transaction. I live in Ohio Not the best news I’d like to hear but thank you for finding the positive in this. You just learned an incredibly valuable lesson for a very low price. Some people have to pay thousands to learn a lesson like this. Lick your chops and move on.  Then your option is to sue them in small claims court.   $15 on PayPal friends and family (I know) The money is gone. PayPal rarely will rule in your favor on a dispute that involves the Friends and Family option, because it's not to be used for what you used it for. Your recourse is to sue them. Whether that's worth $15 to you in light of what it costs to file a small claims suit is up to you. You can sometimes ask that court costs be included in any judgement you receive. You can’t dispute a purchase through family and friends Dispute it in PayPal.
