 I accidentally bumped a woman's car last night in a drive through line. We agreed on $100 to compensate and got it in writing with both of our signatures on a piece of paper. Now, she's texting me saying there was more damage than she originally saw (another scratch). Do I have to pay her any more? Or does the scratch fall under the original agreement? I really want to keep the insurance companies out of this. Thanks in advance folks. If you called the police and got a report or if you swapped insurance info she would just call your insurance company and have them pay. Your rates would go up a bit but maybe for future reference just in case she sees an opportunity to try to get more money out of you directly  Oh my god thank you so much! Also shouts out to Mrs. Jackson, my bus driver from high school, who told me to get anything in writing if something like this happened. Just sent over the text. Then keep that paper in a safe place, and politely tell her that you'll stick to your original agreement. If she sues you, then contact your insurance company. Also, disclaimer: Check your car insurance policy carefully. Many policies require all accidents to be reported to the insurance company.  Texas and "I (my signature) agree that $100 is appropriate compensation for the damage to the car of (her signature) (both of our phone numbers)" What exactly did your agreement say? And what state are you in?
