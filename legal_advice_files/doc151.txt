 My mother is my representative Payee, and I am the beneficiary. She refuses to keep track of all the expenses and calculations and I've been doing them instead with an intense fear that I'm most likely not doing it right. She constantly insults me and belittles me and threatens to kick me out of the house and doesn't care what would happen to me despite my disability with Psychotic Depression and Severe Anxiety. What can I do? Is there any action I can take? Any advice for how to keep up with expenses of SSI and report accurately? I really don't want to get in trouble. Check to see if your county has a Public Guardian office. They may offer a Representative Payee program where an employee of the office is your payee for a small fee. Might be worth it for the piece of mind. If that doesn't help, check your local Area Agency on Aging, they should have a help line for elderly or disabled people to get referrals. It should be possible to get another payee, whether private or public. I used to work as a public payee and we had the forms to send to Social Security to be assigned as a payee for our clients.
