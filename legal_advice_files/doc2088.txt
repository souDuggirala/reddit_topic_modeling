 So, it seems that the leasing office is refusing me a lease transfer due to their internal policies that are not listed on the lease agreement itself. My lease ends in April 2019, so I was thinking of subletting this apartment for four months and then when the time comes, I will send the leasing office a 30 day notice that I no longer want to live there. This should help me recoup some of the money lost on rent, since I am no longer currently living there. 1. Am I stupid for trying to help someone by letting them live there for a few months and then asking them to leave? My thought was to sublet the apartment to them for a few months and in the meantime, they can look for a more permanent housing. 2. Also, there are two other roommates living there who do not plan to leave after the lease ends. Can you guys foresee any issues when I give the leasing office a 30 day notice? Maybe the roommates will rat me out that I sublet the apartment or something? Thanks. This all sounds like a truly stupid idea. First of all, are you all on the same lease? If so you would need the permission of your landlord and all of the roommates to leave if they plan to stay. If you have sublet to someone, you can't give notice because you can't turn over possession back to the landlord, there is someone who lives there with your permission. If you sublet you have a tenant and you can't kick them out without valid cause, which is relatively complex in California. You will at least be obligated to your landlord for however long your tenant continues to occupy the unit. If they stop paying you rent you still need to pay the landlord, and you need to go through a complicated and costly eviction process to get rid of them while still paying rent.
