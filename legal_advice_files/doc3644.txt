 So let's say there's a big Silicon Valley company called "BLANK." BLANK is coming up with a new product, and your friend, "Gabriella," works there. That company comes up with new products regularly, so it's no shocker that something new is in the making. But, Gabriella tells you that the new product is going to be a total flop. She tells you that it will lack X, Y, and Z - and that it will have some features that no one will care for. She advises you to quickly sell all your stocks before the release. It was really a casual conversation, and she didn't mean to let that out. Afterward, she even says "don't tell anyone I told you." No one recorded her, so if she were accused, it's her word against yours. How much trouble can Gabriella get into? EDIT: formatting She could be fired, for starters. Many companies have strict policies against divulging non-public information.
