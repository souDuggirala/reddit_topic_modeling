 For example: A company recruiter reaches out to you via email and outlines the hours worked, pay rate, and overall job description. You are interviewed and accept the job. After completing the onboarding process and several months of work in the outlined conditions, your immediate supervisor wants to force you into doing assignments that are outside of your description and working hours. When you refuse, citing the agreement you made with the company, they tell you that what the recruiter said isn't entirely true. Do you have legal rights and/or recourse in this situation? You can quit. Nobody is forcing you to continue working for a company that was dishonest with you.
