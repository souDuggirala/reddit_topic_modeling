 It's 12:24 am, I just got a call from my friend saying she was just hit by her father and brother, had a drink thrown on her, and is alone walking through town freezing and wet. She's terrified of the cops coming and bringing her home or her father finding her. I was on call with her and told her to walk to my house, she was saying the cops would come here first so she didn't want to. Then her phone died. My parents are wasted and I don't know what to do. I just need to make sure she's safe and I don't know how. I know roughly where she is. She's 16, and I'm in Indiana so it's freezing cold outside. I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub but I need advice [removed] [removed] I would say yes Yes. Well crap. Realistically you can't contact her, you don't know where she is. It's not going to be much help because you can't get in touch with her to tell her this but if/when the cops pick her up, she should tell them that her home environment is unsafe. But I'm sorry you can't influence this at all from what you have said. Itâ€™s best to call the police and tell them where you think she is
