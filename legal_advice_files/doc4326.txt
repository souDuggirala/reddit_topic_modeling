 Just looking for someone to give me advice or insight if they have been in a similar situation. I spent 130$ in self check out and accidentally didn’t scan 5 things probably totaling 30$ if that. I work there and never use self check out for my groceries but the lines were long and I was in a rush as my daughter had to use the bathroom. Loss prevention saw that I didn’t scan the water on the bottom of my cart and pulled me into their office and watched the footage with my manager and he thinks it was a honest mistake and you can clearly see me scanning the items and then just not beeping through. He told me to come to work Monday and we will have another meeting after he goes over the footage with the higher ups. I have no idea what is going to happen. I wasn’t charged and no trespassing charges. Police came and left after they saw I didn’t have a record and the police officer said to look at it as a chance to be more careful when using self check out next time. Just want some advice on what I should do, I’ve already been applying to new jobs just Incase. Has anyone been in my shoes?  Wait and see what happens with your follow-up meeting. Anything could have happened. The fact that the police came and left is a good sign.
