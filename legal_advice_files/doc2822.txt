 My mom is often ruled by heart and when an old flame of hers came back into her life they easily reconnected. She paid for his plane ticket over as well as paid off some outstanding tickets and bills he had in his country. They signed and filled an I-130 and I-485 and were married. Shortly after the marriage, he convinced her to buy a car for him (under her credit cards) and that he would pay her back. After that he became verbally abusive and manipulative and took the car and started living with his brother (who is an hour and a half away.) What are her legal options to try and get some of the money back? In addition to the vehicle, he was also living with her and refused to pay for any home expenditures and would often ask her to buy things for him and she would. None of that money was paid back. It total, she has spent around $30,000 on this asshole and she’s heartbroken because now she realized how much he has been using her. She’s also disabled and the state gives her very little money so she has no idea how she’s going to pay these things. We tried talking to him and telling him to at least give us the car back and that they can then get divorced and she can sell it to pay off part of her debts but he insisted that he would pay it back. It has been almost four months now since she told me all about this and he hasn’t made any payments.  Yeah, it was definitely done through illegal ways. He claims the dealership just messed up but that he didn’t do anything, it just happened.  Are you sure? He cannot simply delete someone else from a valid title. If he did, then either he did so through some sort of illegal means, or your mother permitted it. They originally planned on purchasing the car with both of their names as co-owners but he went back and had her named removed so it’s only in his name  Whose name is the car's title in?  Divorce is her only legal remedy here. Location matters.
