 Hi all, My company has started requesting us to record audio from our security cameras. For example, a group of people will be having a private meeting and our management wants us to record that audio so that they can review what was said. I know Utah is a one party consent state, but I'm concerned that remotely recording audio without our party physically present to give consent might be illegal. Can anyone provide me with statutes/legislation related to this? I manage our security system, so I want to make sure that I am not breaking any laws by providing these recordings. Thanks I'm not sure, but I'm leaning that there is not. Some more detail - the location is a community center within an HOA. We manage the community. The recordings are of resident meetings in reserved rooms. The meetings are open to residents but not to our company.  Is there an expectation of privacy in those areas?
