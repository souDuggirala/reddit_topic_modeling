 I live in a townhome and my next door neighbor's garage roofline is perpendicular to a wall of my house. Basically his garage roof and the wall in the lowest level of my home form a corner. The HOA contracted with a lousy company to have the roof redone and since then I've been noticing some water intrusion into the wall. I hired a professional to tell me the source of the water intrusion and he pointed directly to my neighbor's roof (his roof was improperly flashed and water is flowing on the roof into my wall). To remedy this, a contractor would need to remove several shingles from his roof and install flashing under his roof against my wall. Through the HOA contacted the roofing company and of course they've denied that the roof is improperly installed. The HOA has basically been useless, in that they've not pursued the roofing company in any capacity, neither have the sought to get a clearer understanding of the issue. At this point, Im just ready to have the issue resolved. I'd need my neighbor's consent in order to address the issue. Should we have an agreement written up in which he grants consent for me to remove that area of his roof in order to install the appropriate flashing? If he does not agree to allow me to do this work, is there anything that I can do because the improper roof installation on his property is causing water to seep into mine?  If there is flashing missing where the roof meets a wall, you should check into the inspection performed at the conclusion of the job if one was required. Or alternatively contact local code enforcement to see if the job meets applicable code (it would not in my community, for example). While that may not be a certain path to resolution, it likely is the path of least resistance if there is a code violation.
