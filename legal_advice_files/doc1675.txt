 Hi folks, I've had a terrible experience with my gym and I want to cancel a contract for personal training I signed up for and I'm trying to figure out my options. Here are the quick facts, and I can explain anything in further detail if needed: \-Contract is $200/mo for 12 months. I was told it was 3 months but the contract states 12. My fault for not reading the fine print thoroughly but he lied to me about the length \-I went in to cancel my membership as a whole the front desk employee did some paperwork and then told me I was good to go. Shortly after I got an email confirming the cancellation of my membership but later that day the Operations Manager called me to let me know cancelling the training was "separate". \-When I signed up I was told I could cancel, the penalty would be half of the total amount due, but during the call with the OM he told me he can't cancel it at all. He said he'd talk to some people and try to cancel it got back to me. This was last week he never got back to me. \-I have called and left messages for this person to no avail. \-I have used a grand total of 1 session since I signed up for this about 3-4 weeks ago. At this point do I just dispute the charges? The contract you signed should outline the exact cancellation procedure that must be followed. Read the contract and ensure you’ve done exactly what it says. Many involve more than just showing up in person and saying, “Cancel, please,” and paying a fee.
