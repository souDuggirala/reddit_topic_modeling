 During a pickup basketball game at a local Facility, a guy attacked me and landed a full out upper cut on my jaw. He’s currently in prison facing aggravated battery charges as it messed up my teeth and jaw pretty bad. Anyways, this occurred at 7:50PM and the Facility still closed like normal at 8pm. From the hospital my friend tried calling at 8:10pm and got the voicemail that they were closed. They also just let the guy walk out, with a bloody hand too. Next morning my dad is waiting outside the Facility for them to open so he talk to them as i was not in good health. He told me other guest waiting to get in were discussing why there was so much blood on the pavement (my blood from the night before). Once the Facility opens, my dad finds out that they didn’t even file an incident report and he had to start one himself. The staff literally cleaned up my blood and teeth, then just shut down like any other normal night. I am in Georgia by the way. I was not considering any legal action against this facility but have been told my many that I should look into it. Is this potentially negligence on their part?  "facility" doesn't tell us anything. A school likely has some reporting it's required to do on incidents of that nature, private sports clubs can do whatever the hell they like. They're also not obligated, or even really permitted to detain that individual. I take it someone called the police at some point, considering he's now been arrested. It should be noted that he's in jail awaiting trial, not prison. Prison is when you've been convicted, and of a felony.  That’s what I have thought as well but I have had several people to look into a negligent suit against them for failing to follow their procedures.  YMCA  What exactly do you think you can sue the facility for? Was the facility an urgent care center?
