 Guys help, I accidentally vored my wife and children. See, I recently got into the darker side of tumblr and, well, let’s just say I’m something beginning with F and halfway to becoming an animal rapist. One of my fur-friends on tumblr introduced me to vore and I was instantly hooked. It escalated quickly; I was soon unable to cum without voring something first. I started with small objects, the stapler, my daughters teddy bear. Next it was furniture, I ate most of the chairs in the house before starting on the sofa. I had to explain myself to start with but by the time the bed disappeared my wife began to think something was up. It was at this moment it dawned on me. In order to achieve the perfect vore I had to eat my wife. I didn’t waste any time. She had taken the kids to school so I knew we would be alone when she got back. I waited and when she returned I vored her instantly. She had barely walked through the door by the time she started being digested. I enjoyed it so much I did the same to my kids when I picked them up. What could I do from a legal perspective here? I live in Colorado so if you can let me know if they have any sort of legal exceptions when it comes to vore that’d be great. Yeah I thought as much.. but it also crossed my mind that this guy might be experiencing some sort of psychotic episode. Don’t feed the trolls Umm.. what?? You're asking about the legalities of consuming the flesh of your wife kids? Or am I misunderstanding this whole post..
