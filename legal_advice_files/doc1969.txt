 Last summer, we moved halfway across the country. Our house sat for sale for about 6 months and we finally got a buyer and closed Dec 14, but they moved in on Nov 30. We received our last bill from the water company and it was for over $650 and almost 50,000 gallons used in the 9 days before they took control of the property. While we lived at the address, we rarely went over 3,000 gal usage per month. Through some research of our realtor and us, we learned that the water usage spiked on the day that an appraiser was at the house, and remained high until the buyers moved in. They buyers claim that when they moved in, a toilet was running and they replaced the toilet flap, but no leaks anywhere. The appraiser, who was at the property alone, checked faucets, drains, and toilets as part of their checking things out. Thus we infer they flushed a toilet and it ran for nine days straight and used up the almost 50k gallons. The buyer made a statement that they only noticed a toilet running and replaced the toilet flap the day they moved in, as well as putting utilities in their name. The appraisal company made a statement that they consider it a house defect and they are not at fault. The house was vacant, and obviously not being checked daily or anything. Wouldn't checking that the toilet finished its cycle be included in part of the appraisal process? The water ran as a direct result of an action taken by the appraiser. If not the appraisal company, would our real estate company hold the responsibility?  It's your fault for not checking them in the first place and replacing the broken piece It was still your house, and that means it’s your responsibility. Yeah it sucks and that’s a good bit of money but no one is to blame  It should be part of the process if they flushed it to see if it works. But it looks like you are out of luck unless you have footage of them flushing the toilet,but there shouldn't be any cameras in the bathroom in the frist place
