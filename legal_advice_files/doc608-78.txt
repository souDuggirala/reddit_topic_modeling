I'm using an alternate account because my main account is NSFW and I've told friends &amp; family about this case. I'm suing my previous landlord because they failed to return the security deposit for my apartment after I moved out. It's a long story and if any additional details are needed, please ask.

Iowa uses an electronic filing system where the plaintiff, defendant, and court can post documents. I have filed 3 documents: a small claims original notice (form 3.4 since the defendant is out-of-state), a verification of account (form 3.27), and an itemized statement of claims. The court has posted 4 documents: 3 certified mail receipts (dated 10/30, 11/2, and 11/8; the last of which was signed by who I assume is the defendant's secretary), and a court order filed this morning.

The court order says that there was a "return of original notice" filed, and that the court is "unable to ascertain whether the defendant was properly served with notice pursuant to Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure 1.305(1)". It also says I have 90 days from the date of filing (10/29) to make service upon the defendant &amp; file proof of it.

The problem is I paid an extra $10 (on top of the $85 filing fee) to have service delivered via certified mail, since the defendant's headquarters is in Texas. I thought the filing of the signed &amp; certified mail receipt (filed by the court, not me or the defendant) would be sufficient proof of service.

Have I misunderstood what constitutes as "proof of service"? If so, what steps should I take moving forward?

Thanks in advance!
