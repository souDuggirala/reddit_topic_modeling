(NY) Hi I work 12+ hours days as a waitress sometimes (part time job)  and I only get one half hour break. That’s it.  I was just wondering if this is legal.  Most workers who are working a full-time shift are entitled to a meal break period at some point during their shift.  Workers who work a shift that is at least 6 hours long and lasts between 11 AM and 2 PM are entitled by New York labor laws about breaks to a half hour unpaid meal break for lunch.  Workers who start work before 11 AM and end after 7 PM are entitled not only to their lunch break, but an additional 20 minute meal break between 5 and 7 PM.

If you are an employee who works more than 6 hours starting any time between 1 PM and 6 AM, you are entitled to a mid-shift 45 minute unpaid meal break according to NY labor laws about breaks.  Factory workers receive special treatment in New York labor laws about breaks—instead of the 45 minute break, they are entitled to a full hour.  If you work a shift that is shorter than 6 hours, NY labor laws about breaks do not entitle you to any break time for meals.
