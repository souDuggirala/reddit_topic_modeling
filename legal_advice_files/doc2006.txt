 Recently lost my debit card in nyc and it sounds like the nypd has found an individual with my card. A detective has called my bank looking for me to call them. Am I required to call the detective back? All charges were declined at point of sale, If possible please lock your card through the online bank account. (I.e. BofA lets you do this) Why would you refuse to speak to the police when they are investigating a crime against you?  No No charges went through and did actually lose card. Thanks for your reply Oh absolutely the bank may not reimburse him if he doesn't cooperate.  It doesn't seem to be the case, but if some charges did go through, the bank may decline to reverse them if OP does not cooperate with the investigation and provide a police report. No you are not required to speak with the police.
