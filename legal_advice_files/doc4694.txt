 I need to provide very few details for my own safety. I am not a victim. I have suspected many were victims of sexual abuse by this person and it has now been confirmed through another person that someone we both know was molested by the predator when the victim was around 12. This would be 10+ years ago. I have no contact with the victim, but I am around the predator a lot. I’m not his predatory interest so I am not in danger, but people I love potentially are. Confronting him would be dangerous and cutting off contact would be suspicious to him and would require cutting off a lot of people and would not protect anyone else. My state has no statute of limitations on children sex crimes, but I have no way to make the victim make the accusation. I understand it was traumatic for him and it would very difficult to relive these accounts and have other people know about them so I would not ask him to come forward, even if I had contact. For protection of loved ones, I went to the police on my own to see if I could provide an anonymous tip or launch an investigation as I’m certain there are several more victims. I was told that unless I had permission from the victim to report it or I was a victim myself, I could not do anything. At this point, everything would be my word against his until more people were brave enough to come forward. Is there any organization that would investigate? Is there anything I can do to protect those I love? I already try to stay around the predator as much as possible when he is around young boys, but I can’t protect everyone. No one should have to endure what he’s done to at least one young man and I’m certain many more.  You can make a report to police if you’d like, but without a victim they will likely not move forward. At this point you think someone did something illegal. Until someone that knows they did comes forward, it’s just speculation and rumors.
