  Not my car, just curious.  No. The outside line is the edge of the lane of traffic. To the left is the road, to the right is the curb/swale/non-lane. So the car is parked on the road. And since there is a painted lane on the edge of the road, the car cannot park on the road. (This is why you can just park on the street in many residential areas - there is no painted edge of the lane. But if you go to a busy downtown district, you'll often see the outside lane painted, which means you can't just park there.) Itâ€™s a lead-in to a marked parking spot The angled line would indicate that a two-lane street is narrowing to one-lane plus a parking lane. That wouldn't be a legal parking space.
