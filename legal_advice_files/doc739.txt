 I decided as an 18 y/o to get a credit card to help balance activities as a youth, I’m now 26 and regret it. I am from the UK and I’ve been living abroad for almost 5 years. Before I left the country I owed maybe 700 pounds, I couldn’t afford to pay anything and I told my local bank I was leaving the country and wondered if there was anything I can to pay it off. I told them my dad would pay the minimum monthly to eventually pay it off and they said sure that would be fine. A year later my dad (we don’t speak too often) told me the debt had been taken over and was no longer through Lloyd’s bank, and that they won’t let him pay anything from it as it had to be from me, he went on to tell them I was living abroad and that was pretty much that. Last year my mum received a letter saying I owed almost £1800 and now I’m starting to freak out. I have only been home briefly for visits and this is the first thing I’ve heard of since I spoke to the lady in the bank almost 5 years ago, no emails to either of the addresses I had on file with my bank and no letters too my home address other than this last one. Does anyone have any advice on what i can do about this? I’m happy to start paying things off as I’m sure I’ll be moving back one day, but is there a way to somehow get these additional fees that have been added on taken off as I had told the lady I was leaving the country and that my dad would be paying the minimal? Thanks in advance, and for the time taken to read this whether you can help or not.
