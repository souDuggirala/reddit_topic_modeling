 Unsure whether this belongs here but I have nowhere else (to my knowledge) to ask this question. Two years ago I had some health problems and went to see a specialist. After getting scoped, I was told they would contact me with results and never did. After hearing nothing for months a bill comes in the mail from the surgery center showing I have an outstanding balance. Pissed off, I never responded to their messages. I thought about contacting them and try to have the specialist foot the bill because I never got my results. I never did because I was afraid that they would strong arm me and force me to pay for a service that never was fully completed. Now two years later there is a hit on my credit history and knocked my score lower than Iâ€™m comfortable. Is there any action I can take to have this removed of my history? If not can I force the specialist to pay for it considering I never received my results? I am 22M in college and have never faced a situation like this. I can clarify or answer further questions if needed. Thanks in advance!
