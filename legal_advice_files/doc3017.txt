 She was dating this guy (M) and at the time, she was working at a furniture store. M got a new house and asked her to pay for the couches. In the end, they were about $1000. Fast forward a bit and they break up. Now M still has the couches and hasn't payed back my mom. Its been over a year now. Does she have any options to get her money through a court?  Ok. She can go to small claims court and make her case. He'll likely claim it was a gift, but she can argue that it wasn't. If she has any text messages, voicemails, email communications where he indicates even informally that he understands he needs to pay her back or she can show any payments he previously made for the couch, that will help to support her argument. Small claims does not require an attorney, she would just have to pay the filing fees. It's up to her to decide if she wants to pursue this and take a risk that she could be out more time/money or if she wants to let this go.  Thank you for the advice I can't answer that. Only she can decide if it's worth the risk. So, its not wise to take it to court?  Sure. She can sue him. She'll claim it was a loan and he'll claim it was a gift. And if he paid for anything she received, he'll counter-claim for the cost of those things on the same basis. I just know that they agreed, whether it was verbal or written is what i dont know Depends. Did mom ever have an agreement with M to pay her back for the couches? Can she show that? Because unless so, this looks very much like a gift.
