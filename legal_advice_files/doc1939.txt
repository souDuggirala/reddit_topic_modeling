 If this post isn’t allowed here just let me know of a more suitable subreddit. Can a private investigator get me arrest records even if the person wasn’t convicted? And could a pi also get me things someone was investigated for but never arrested for? The person I’m looking into was accused of being arrested several times by people I know after several google searches I only found one thing.
