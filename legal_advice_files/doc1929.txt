  I was driving down a somewhat busy intersection. I looked at the traffic light and it was yellow and it turned yellow a few seconds before. Having a red light camera in that intersection, I stopped because I was thinking it would turn red once I was in the middle of turning. The lady driving behind me had a different idea and thought I was gonna go through so she didn't stop and hit me. I might say that it mightve been my fault for somewhat making it look like I was gonna go and not stop, but I'm a slower driver and usually go a few kmph, below the speed limit. The crash mostly damaged he car more but no one was injured, our car had a few deep scratches in the back and some parts were cut open, some person pointed out that below the car there is a lot of damage. Our car was still able to be driven but the other ladies car that crashed us was not. The police arrived, they sided with us saying because she hit us at the back it would be her fault. Both of the insurance companies are agreeing to pay for my repairs but I need to know is there anything I can do in this situation. Thanks  Ok Thanks She is at fault. What are you wanting to have happened that isn't happening here? You say the police and insurance all agree. What do you mean “anything you can do?”.   Not your fault, her fault as she made an incorrect assumption. If your respective insurers are dealing with the claim and repairs, I am not sure there is anything left to do unless you have a personal injury as a result of that accident?
