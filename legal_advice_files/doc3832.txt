 I tried to get a job at Tim Hortons in New York and they denied my employment because I currently do not have my highschool diploma or GED. I am trying to get my GED currently, but i also need a job.  I’m assuming this is why you’re getting your GED. If they hired you without one, then that defeats the purpose of why you’re getting one to get a better job. Requirements are in place for a reason.  Nothing illegal about this at all. All entry level means is that they feel you have the base skills needed to advance in the job. There can still be set requirements, however. An entry level IT position would still require you to have knowledge of how computers work. You're still in class for GED, and they require you to have a diploma in order to work there. Sorry. No If the requirement of the job is that you need a HS diploma or GED, then that's the requirement you need to meet. That's the same as any job. You can't be a surgeon without a medical degree. Just because you're working on it doesn't mean they have to give you the job now. They can choose to hire whoever they like and can set an education requirement for employment, yes.  Is it illegal for them to do this as an entry level job? It's not illegal to require a specific level of education (or equivalent), your only recourse is to keep looking [removed] ok. What's your legal question?
