So i had ordered a phone from Amazon UK and had a issue with customer service so i got refunded and had to wait for my money, 7 days. So i ordered another one and it was late getting delivered so i contacted customer service and was told it was lost in transit. They issued a refund and that was fine, went to town and spent the money.
Now the phones arrived, what can happen? Can Amazon take that money again without contacting me or will i just keep my head down and see how it plays out? 
Thank in advance A simple mistake doesn't mean Amazon (or the seller) has to eat the loss and you get two free phones. &gt; What if i wanna keep it though?



Then you have to pay for them, like anything else you want but isn't currently yours. 




&gt; This is their mistake




Can you please explain what "mistake" you think they made? You purchased a phone, the shipping was taking longer than normal so they refunded you instead of telling you "well, just wait it out and see." They most likely got in contact with the shipper and asked them to return the packages but they couldn't be located. Once the "lost" packages were found, they were then delivered according to the label on them. You now have the product you ordered, and a refund. So you can either keep the refund and return the items you no longer have purchased, or you can keep the item and give the refund back (ie, "re-purchasing" the item). 



There is no way you can legally keep the phones and refunds.  No, it wasn't.

You can refer to /r/LegalAdviceUK for further details.  But I'd guess that you don't get to keep a free phone that you ordered and then got a refund for because it was mistakenly reported as lost in transit. [deleted] Contact Amazon, let them know that the phones arrived and you need a shipping label to return them.
