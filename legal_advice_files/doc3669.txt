 My sister was out at one of her friends bday party. The bar only has one restroom stall for both sexes, she went to use the restroom but I guess the door didn’t fully lock. The guy opened the door and he kept opening while she was using it, then he left the door wide open to humiliate her. She came out and he broke a bottle over my sisters head causing her to get 6 stitches. She wasn’t gonna do anything other than press charges but I told her to sue the bar because the security should’ve noticed when he was messing with her in plain sight leaving the door open and not stopping the guy. Also might have been over served. Can she sue the bar AND the attacker? A case against the bar is a long shot. Either way if she wishes to pursue this for monetary damages she'll have to consult a personal injury lawyer.  You didn't add your location. That's something she should really talk to the prosecutor about before consulting with other civil attorneys. Even if a case of that nature has merit, it could interfere or impact the criminal case.
