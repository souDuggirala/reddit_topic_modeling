 Hi All I have been in discussions with someone who has built out a website resource which provides the history of a specific subject. This has been a passion project for over 20 years and is a great resource. They have reached the point where they can no longer support the site and my company would like to in effect becomes sponsors of the site and to ensure it remains a resource for evermore. We would also want to upgrade the site and augment the content. We are looking for the simplest and easiest way to put in place an agreement around this. It will continue to be a non-commercial website albeit we may repurpose some of the content for use outside of the site. Thanks Arb
