 my neighbor's window had a rock thrown at it last night. they asked if I saw anything which I didn't but I was wondering what actions can they take to maybe find out who did it, if any?  not sure if they have cameras but ig there's nothing I can do thanks to those who responded so quickly oh okay I guess not. I'll delete it then Im not a lawyer. Ok, did they have cameras around the house? They already asked the neighbors but no one is going to confess... there is little they can do but replace it. Check cameras, ask people if they saw anything, etc. This isn't really a legal question.  no I don't dislike them that much  Did you throw a rock through the window?
