 My cousin was arrested for 75 counts of CP, and we are worried he will try to plead mental instability and get out of jail sooner. He has an “intellectual disability”. He waived his right to a preliminary, whatever that means and has an Arraignment on the 28th. I have a copy of his case details because they are public information in my state (Wisconsin), but I am not sure if this subs rules allow me to link it. If someone can clarify for me whether I am allowed to link it, I will so you guys can see what I am looking at. So what will happen in terms of his sentence if he pleads that way, as in does it get shorter in jail? Or are there other ways he could serve it? When does he make his plea either way? Before or after the Arraignment? I would prefer him to stay in jail forever.  A person in possession of 75 counts of child porn SHOULD be in jail forever.   Hey guess what, that isn't your decision.  Of course do not link, as that would identify your cousin exactly. Not only that, but don't upload screenshots as we won't be able to look over and interpret them for you. Call a criminal defense attorney where you live and ask for their take on what the page says. No one can say what will happen. He may wind up found to be partially or fully inculpable due to the severity of his disability, no one here knows. Whether or not that happens, unless your cousin is very old, he's not spending the rest of his life in prison.
