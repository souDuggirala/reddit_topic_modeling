 My dad passed in Nov 18' with a will. My sister is the executor, and we do not get along. She has made every excuse not to show me my dad's will ,and says she has four years to probate. However, she refuses to probate as she says it will cost too much and I am only set to receive $1,000. It will cost $1,300 to probate. Dad changed his will less than a year before he died, while on hospice. I had my portion reduced. She says there is a no contest clause in the will. She said she would send me a letter I have to sign to releas the funds to me, but I refused without an attorney looking it over first. After I said that she has refused to talk to me. I have attempted to get a low income attorney to make her probate, but they cannot take my case due to caseload. My dad's attorney is also my sister's attorney. Does any of this sound suspicious? I feel my sister should just show me the will, then pay me when she has figured out his estate. She also moved to a very expensive gated community right before he died, even though she is low income. Tldr; should my sister show me the will before probate Thank you! NAL - but found this information with regards to getting a copy of a will from someone who is refusing to cooperate.
