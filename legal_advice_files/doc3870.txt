 I purchased a couple acres of commercial vacant land to build an office/warehouse for my business. The land has been used by the neighboring landscaping company to dump their tailings (dirt, rocks, sod, concrete...nothing hazardous). The person I bought the land from lives out of state, and was not aware of the numerous piles of debris. I used this info to get a decent price for the property. Purchase agreement clearly states I purchased as-is and notes the piles of debris in the purchase contract. I obviously will introduce myself and talk to the landscaper first before broaching a legal option, but still want to know of any relevant statutes could inspire him to remove my newly purchased debris piles free of charge?
