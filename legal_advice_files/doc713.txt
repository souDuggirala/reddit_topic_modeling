 So a friend and I want to start our own business that will mostly be based on our intellectual property. We have heard and done our research on the organizational types that we could form and the best looking option (to our untrained selves) is the LLC. My questions are: How does the LLC protect us and from what? What does the LLC do for us legally? Should we try to create the operating agreement ourselves or go to a business lawyer? Thanks for any help explaining things.  Thank you so much for the explanation and advice! The LLC is essentially like a separate entity that you and your friend will operate the business from, as long as you keep the LLC adequately capitalized and do not commingle funds, it will limit your liability by preventing people from suing you and your buddy directly, limiting their suit to the finances of the LLC itself. An LLC does what is described above, if you and your buddy were to operate without an entity, then you would be operating as a partnership, which is a very bad idea. You should definitely go to a business lawyer to learn about the pitfalls that can lead to piercing the corporate veil, but if you just create the business entity, you will have the statutory default operating agreement. It is always a good idea to write down what obligations you will each owe to the business and what kinds of things will happen in the event of dissolution or if one of you leaves. There are a TON of other things you need to consider, which could lead to issues down the road, but what I've said is a general rundown of the general issues to look out for.
