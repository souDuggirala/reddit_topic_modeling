 Hi all, first time here but I thought maybe someone could help. On mobile so apologies for any weird formatting, or if I messed up the flair or something. Basically, a friend of mine was complaining last night that she hasn’t had a day off since Christmas. She was supposed to have one earlier this week, but got called into work. I live in America, but she lives in Australia (Victoria, specifically) and it really struck me as odd. She said she wasn’t going to get a day off for at least another three weeks because her boss was going on vacation. I know next to nothing about Australian law and google wasn’t much help, so I have no idea about the policy behind days off/overtime there. She works about 40-45 hours a week. I’m wondering if there’s any legal action she can take to get time off, or a paid vacation. She lives nearly paycheck to paycheck which is why she doesn’t speak up more about it, but I can tell she is becoming very stressed out and she really needs a break. I’m worried about her mental health at this point. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I’ll try there. thank you  Try /r/auslegal this is mostly Canada and US.
