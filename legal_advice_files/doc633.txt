 Hey first off sorry if this is not the appropriate subreddit, I was initially going to post in the medical advice sub but after reading their guidelines this is the next most suitable place I could think of. Pretty self explanitory, I turned 18 pretty recently and have been living under an anti vaccine parent, I want to get vaccinated now but I don't know anything about the medical system, or what vaccines I need to get. I have no money and for obvious reasons am unable to procure funds from my parents for this purpose. Is there any way to get these vaccines for free and find out which ones I should get? If it's relevant I'm in the state of Texas. This is answered in our wiki. Please use it. Post deleted. Do not repost This is a medical question, not a legal one.
