 We live in Columbus, Ohio and closed on our home about a month and a half ago. We just received a letter from the city stating they have been unable to get the previous home owners to pay the final bill, so now they expect us to pay. It’s about $300, so I really do not want to pay it as it’s not from our services. Is there anything we can do?  Contact your realtor, they should handle this. The bill goes with the property so the water company isn't going to ignore it. Was this unpaid bills from months or the last bill? What did your sale agreement say about bills? Either way, realtor is your first call. In my case we knew the bill wouldn't be ready until after the sale sent through because that's how my area worked. We contacted our realtor with a copy of the bill and, per the sales agreement, payment was sent to the water company out of escrow. We followed up to make sure it got paid otherwise we would have paid while we waited for the check to come through. I’m not sure. How would I know? Are they regulated by a Utilities Commission? Perhaps you could lodge a complaint, that usually gets attention. Yeah we weren’t notified beforehand. We’ll have to call the Title company after Christmas.  Not a Lawyer. This is sadly pretty normal, and should have been disclosed by the Title Searches at some point. If it wasn't and you got Title Insurance for yourself, contact them, as they should have turned this up and may be required to cover this.
