 Twenty minutes ago I received a text from a random number I don’t know saying “Hi!!! How r you?! It's Jeni frmm MeetMe from the other night.. Here's thaat pic I told u I was sending. :)” I’ve already realized this is a scam of some sort but is there anything I can do to make sure I’m not ending up the one at fault. I haven’t replied to them nor do on intending but I’ve heard cases like this where the victim is charged with child pornography or forced into paying large amounts of money to the person sending the pictures.  Just delete the text and block the number so it doesn't go any further.  I got this exact same message last week. I reverse-searched the image and it actually came from r/gonewild. I'm not sure what the scam is, but DO NOT REPLY. Edit: also I never got any follow-up messages so you probably don't have to worry about that. I assume it's some sort of porn or prostitution scam advertising or something. I reported it to my cell phone carrier via their website, but I doubt there's much they can do other than block that specific number.   FYI, if you get a call "from the dad" and he's angry and demands money (for counseling / a replacement phone / etc), not only should you not send money, you should be aware that it is the same person who sent you the photo with the hopes you would panic. Same if there's a follow up "from the Sheriff/constable/detective" after that, even if the name given matches someone in that jurisdiction (they can Google as well as you can), even if the caller ID has that department's phone number (phone number spoofing is easy).  Don't respond, block their number, and don't worry, you've done nothing wrong. Just delete and block. You aren't responsible for someone spamming a snatch to random numbers. If anyone follows up, ignore it. Just delwte, block and ignore, nothing will happen.
