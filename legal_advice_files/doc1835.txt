 I legally changed my name in CA last year I never expected to move or thought It necessary to change my birth certificate. My ID and SS card have my new name on them but my birth certificate does not. It is to my understanding, after speaking briefly to an attorney, that I need my birth certificate to prove my citizenship at the DPS, in addition to the other two documents. This will cause me problems because: A) my name will reverse on my ID to what is on my birth certificate. This is OK though not ideal B) My Social Security card will no longer match my ID or birth certificate. This will cause me problems because I am looking for work and employers typically ask for two forms of consistent identification. The Texas ID change will not overrule the California decree changing my name with Social Security. I will probably need to hire an attorney, but I am asking whether what I know so far is correct. I almost feel like I might need to move back to California due to these overwhelming barriers. Thank you You're welcome. Good luck. I got it from the courthouse. Iâ€™n pretty sure it is. Thank you Make sure it's a certified copy. If you don't have one, the court in CA can get you one if you pay for it (you may want to order a bunch and keep them on hand). Good luck. Not yet. I do have a copy of it Have you checked with the DPS to see if your birth certificate plus a certified copy of your name-change order is sufficient? People change their name all the time, especially upon marriage, so it seems unlikely that a birth certificate matching a social security card is an absolute requirement.
