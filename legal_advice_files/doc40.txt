 You asked this question a week ago. What do you think has changed since then to merit another post? Not let me keep the money—idk why she would do that—but maybe be willing to help me build a case against him, as he wronged her just as much as he wronged me. But you are right with the police and their expertise. My concern now, in hindsight of course, is that he was spending the money on drugs or something illegal..... if he tried manipulating this case in his favor to not paying with something like that, like "the money was used for illicit activity, therefore he's not liable"? I'm just trying to think 2 steps ahead of him. Would that ever be the case? I am going to go to the police I think. I would go to the police. What is the true owner going to do? Let you keep several thousand dollars that were stolen? The police will be familiar with this fraud scheme. It is just a variation of getting the victim to unwittingly cash a bogus check for a part of the proceeds. No, you're right.... damn man... damn. What do you think about me emailing the true owner of the account? I really want to touch base with her. Maybe she will be willing to help me? How should I go about that email? Thanks for your input by the way.. really down in the dumps right now That is a possibility. But how likely is it that a small time scam artist will have anything to pay ? You can't get something from nothing. If the police criminally charge him, and he is found guilty, will he be ordered to pay me back? This seems more criminal fraud than a civil case. You should discuss the issue with the police. Your chance of recovering any money from someone without a bank account will be slim.
