 Just now, a neighbor had called the police because I had left my dog outside for much too long (closer to 4 hours) in the cold. I had just played with him, and when I got home I had fallen fast asleep. It was entirely my fault and I'll take full responsibility, but the problem is that I'm 15 and I'm not sure how this will be handled. Any advice and how I should proceed would be much appreciated, I love my dog with all my heart and I hate to see him taken away. Calgary, Alberta Yes, I'll be sure to better my training as it has been quite lackluster. I've simply been procrastinating doing anything, and I'm going to up my training game  I think you just need some help with him,and a muzzle is not the answer. Please reach out to the shelter he was adopted from for help. Good luck! Not tethered, but muzzled because he has a tendency to bite everything. I'm just a bit frazzled, and I realize I could be a better owner and am very much regretting not being a better one. That is completely right, and although he is a cross and can stay outside in the cold (fur, but not incredibly thick), doing so for multiple hours was not intended. Either the low temperatures or the dog was tied up? Either way I doubt he will be taken from OP. I assume this is a breed of dog that does not tolerate the cold? The concern of the police is likely that the windchill has been below -20 most of the day in Calgary.  Not barking for 4 hours, but for at least 1 hour. My dad was working, and had just got back when the police were called. If you are 15 you are a minor and you live with adults? Where were the rest of the household in this case? Why did the neighbour call the police? Was your dog barking excessively for 4 hours straight? Or was it just outside quiet in a fenced garden? I don't understand how this was an offence that warrants a call to the police?  You’re 15. You’ll be okay. Your caregiver will explain things .
