 I wasn't going to raise a big stink about it until I talked to a few people that are saying I should be mad. I was sick in the hospital, ended up getting a pretty nasty infection (kinda gross, nothing super embarassing), I told my boss what I had and that I am highly contagious so I need to miss work until I'm cleared by my doctor. My manager sends out an email to me and all of my coworkers specifying "V1k1ng1990 is out sick indefinitely with (insert infection here). Currently infectious, not good. (google it). I know there is a HIPPA aspect here but I'm not sure since it seems like it was more of a warning to my coworkers. Should I do anything or just move on with my life? I've always been a big believe in "choose your battles" at the workplace, because there's always room for some r/maliciouscompliance if you piss off the wrong person [removed]  'm cleared by my doctor. Don't do that next time. Just submit the FMLA certification if you qualify. It does not require you to disclose the exact nature of the medical issue. HIPAA HIPAA only covers those actually working in the health field, so it does not apply here. It's incredibly insensitive, but to even your admission not even really embarrassing. Your boss was most likely just trying to highlight to the team how contagious you were with this "non-embarrassing" condition. You can maybe talk to your boss about it if you feel strongly about it. Nothing illegal,however. Maybe best to drop it and not let "a few people" try to sour your work environment.  Not a HIPAA violation since your manager is not a healthcare provider. It's insensitive, but not illegal. Drop it and move on.
