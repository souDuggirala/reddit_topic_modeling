 Hi guys. I’m 20 years old, and my parents are undocumented immigrants. They have been here for about 20 years. My dad never applied for citizenship when they were giving it. But now that I’m almost 21, I can get papers for them right? Does getting food stamps affect my eligibility to give them papers? What are the steps I should take? Thank you for my advice.  Will do. Thanks Try an immigration forum  Thank you for replying. Is it a for sure though? Or what factors might affect eligibility? Would food stamps affect it? They need an immigration attorney ASAP and may need to leave/come back to get the process of lawful status started.
