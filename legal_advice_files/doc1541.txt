 I started working for a clinic in a new city a few months ago and as a student work part time. They accidentally direct deposited my money into a non existent account and after contacting them for months still haven’t fixed the issue. I’ve also been traveling to different practices for work and haven’t been paid any of my gas miles since September. I’ve contacted HR, payroll, and several managers but since I’m just a part time college student in my early 20’s in a company of 30+ practices no one has put in any effort to fix this. I was wondering what my legal actions are, the total I am missing is about a thousand so I’m not sure what options to look into
