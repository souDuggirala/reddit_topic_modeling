 On December 3rd 2018, a drunk driver crashed through our backyard. He took out our fence, one of our trees, and caused electrical damage that required that we hire an electrician. We submitted the claim with State Farm immediately. They've really been dragging their feet with this whole process. We called to check on the status of the claim a little over a week after the accident and they still hadn't even acquired a copy of the accident report; we ended up emailing them our copy, since they were taking their time. Two weeks after the accident, we had a landscaping company come out and provide a quote for the damage. Just today (over 2 months later) we heard back from the insurance company and they're sending out a claims adjuster to assess the damage. They're doing a really lazy job, in my opinion. They only ever try to call us around dinnertime. We connected with them and they said they had attempted to reach out the landscaping company and they never heard back. We asked them when they called and they said they had called a few weeks back and left a voicemail. We had to tell them to call the landscaping company again, to which the woman responded, "I can call now, but it'll probably go to voicemail." At this point, we had to teach this representative to actually call people during regular business hours if she wants to make any progress (which it honestly seems like she doesn't want to). I think I just really need to vent, but I'm also wondering: how long should a claim like this take before it's resolved? What is a normal timeline to expect? I work in health insurance and if I dragged my feet this much to connect with the necessary contacts, my job would be on the line. TLDR: How long does it take for a pretty cut-and-dry home insurance claim to be resolved? Is there anything I can communicate to State Farm that could make them work at a more reasonable pace?
