 Basically as mentioned in title. District Manager is forcing all his store managers and assistant store managers to be in a group text thread, without any way of opting out, especially on our days off. Is this legal? Should I be compensated for the time that I reply to these messages, or for anytime he send a message in the group text? Most important question - not a lawyer. If you are required to respond you may be owed. If you are not required to respond, mute the thread. Generally incidental stuff like this is not compensated. As a practical solution use google voice with a separate number for them. Are you required to respond?  Is this a work phone or a personal phone? Personal phone I would consider off limits. A work phone you would have to see what your employment agreement or job description states. Are you on call? Are you OT exempt? Etc etc etc. Do you have union representation? This is also a good question for your union rep as the answer can vary from company to company.  Right? I want compensation for every time she messages us because I’m taking time out of my schedule of life.  Yes, it’s very frustrating as a non-salary employee to be unable to have a complete disconnect from work on your days off. I’ve always wanted to know this, too. My boss messages all of us in a group text when I’m not even working to discuss her issues with our jobs.  I do, but Apple Watches do not have the option to mute individual text threads, so I have to either silence all notifications or deal with the constant buzzing of my Apple Watch. Plus it’s the principal. Why don't you just mute the notifications when you're not working?
