 For some more information I work in the scalehouse at the dump, where we weight peoples trucks in and out, and recently we have been told that we need to start charging people a $5 fee for loads that aren't strapped down or covered with a tarp. The thing is that people have come by asking "what gives you the right, you're not police". What I want to know is: are they correct in saying that we aren't able to give them the fee? That fee is so standard I canâ€™t believe these bozos are trying to fight about it. Yes you can charge that fee. They are NOT correct. Your property, your policies. They can go somewhere else. Most dumps now also require a orange safety vest worn by everyone on the property for insurance reason. Just tell them the new insurance requires this, this, and this. Don't like; see yah. No different then how a RV park can have rules about clutter around your RV.
