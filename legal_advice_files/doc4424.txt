 I know a few people that like to go out of town and steal clothes from different states In the U.S. They come back from out of town and make a lot of money selling it in the streets. I'm wondering if they will ever get caught, and if not how will I go about to tip off certain people about what they are doing? I find it wrong that they are doing this and making honest people lose their job because of this. (This is my 1st time posting on reddit and asking people for help, please help.)  People generally won't buy clothes off the street for the same price they'd pay at a mall, so it's pretty safe to assume the value was over $5000. Doesn't matter what revenue they made off the items, it matters how much those items cost to purchase from the retailer they were stolen from. Thank you for the advice! I will do that!  Just a couple weeks ago they made about 4,000-4,500$, they go to different malls in different states stealing clothes in bulk. I mean a whole car trunk filled with clothes.  We cannot predict if they will be caught. If you want, you can report their possession of stolen property to the police (via non-emergency line).  You can submit a tip to your local FBI office about the interstate transportation of stolen property. However, I believe it's only classified as that if the value of the items is over $5000.
