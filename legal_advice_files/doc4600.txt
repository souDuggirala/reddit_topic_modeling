 I planned on going to the courts monday morning like i was advised when i called the county i got arrested in. But my small local cops came sunday. I had no chance to go to courts to show them recipets of me paying online. Anyway i went to casenet and it still says i have a warrant? I paid bail and got new court hearing. How long does the warrant take to come off??? When we pick someone up on a warrant we ask dispatch to place a locate on the warrant. All of this goes on through the national NCIC network and whatever network the state uses. Casenet probably updates off of those on a delay. I doubt an officer is getting info off that network though, it would come from NCIC most likely. Edit: I just did some checking and casenet is the court network. Until the warrant return gets processed by the court it will stay on there. It’s not the network that is checked when police run your ID though so you shouldn’t worry about getting picked up twice on the same warrant.
