 I at a group home work for a special needs agency in NYC. A while back I worked 80+ hours in one week. The first shift that week really started Saturday night at 10pm and went until Sunday at 9:30am. The people at payroll told me that because my began on Saturday night the hours are counted toward the previous week which would mean I wouldn't get time and a half. I've seen them do it before and at times it has been to my advantage. My question is: Can a company/ organized count all hours of a shift toward the week at the beginning of the shift? They do generally count Sunday at 12am as the beginning of the workweek. Thanks! No. Each week stands alone.  So a week starts on Sunday and I'm in middle of a shift at 12am Sunday, is there any reason the following hours would count toward the previous week? It may be a two week pay period but overtime is decided based on the 7 day week. It has to be a fixed 168 hour pay period.  It's a two week pay period. Your work week is determined by the pay period. Ask your hr.
