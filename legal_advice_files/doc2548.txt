 I saw a ad for a 2005 honda accord coupe with a good price on it, after checking it out in person and a quick test drive and look we didn't notice anything and the buyer claimed nothing was wrong with it. A day later after purchasing it we realize the car has a issue when accelerating causing the wipers to go off along with the radio not working which the seller never disclosed to us, he also deleted the listing quickly after the sale, was wondering if I had any chance getting my money back or if I am stuck with the car P.S - I understand that I'm buying a using car but just feel like he hid obvious problems from us in order to get a quick sale. The seller is not required to inform you of every, little problem the car has. This makes sense. Why keep a car listed if it's been sold? If they were obvious, then it would likely be on you to notice the obvious and buy or not buy the car in light of those obvious problems. The hard truth is that used car sales are as-is, and unless the seller intentionally misrepresented the vehicle or made specific, false claims about the vehicle, then when you buy it, you're also buying all the past/present/future problems the car had/has/will have. It's also a 14-year-old car. 14-year-old cars are almost guaranteed to have problems, some of them major. Expecting there to be nothing wrong with a 14-year-old car is unreasonable. new york Used car purchases are generally sold "As Is". Your state may have laws to protect you. Since you didn't post your location, who knows... That is also why you should never buy a car without taking it to a mechanic for an inspection. Never trust a seller to give you all the details. Person-to-person used car sales are typically assumed to be as-is. You can not get a refund.  Nothing about this sounds like anything other than you failed to adequately inspect the vehicle in an as-is transaction.
