 So my friend has a bit of an issue where the Salvadoran government believes he’s a gang member and they want to lock him up . He’s even on Interpol as a red flag . he’s not in the country anymore . What should he do. He by no means is affiliated with any gangs in El Salvador or the where he lives now. they haven’t contacted him . he tried talking to a lawyer but the lawyer said this was a big issue and he couldn’t help . the photo on interpol is a photo of him so i doubt he was a mistake  Have they contacted him or put a warrant out for his arrest? Interpol and other international watch lists are notorious for false positives due to similar names and AKAs.
