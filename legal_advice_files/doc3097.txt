 I’m located in South Carolina, and my son (10) got a model rocket for Christmas from his grandfather. It’s advertised in the box to fly up to 600ft (realistically around 300-400ft based on the rocket fuel he got) And I want to let him launch it but I’m just not sure the legality of doing so. So I was hoping someone could maybe point me in a direction on the matter. I looked online but I couldn’t find anything that actually answered my question. There are a few parks nearby with large open spaces that I considered using as a place to go. Or I can do it in my own backyard which is pretty big and open but nearby other houses. It’s a really cool gift and I just want to make sure that we aren’t going to get in trouble for actually using it so hopefully someone can help let me know where we can launch it from.  what you can do and can't do should be in here: []()  That should answer most legal questions! If you join the NAR, it includes liability insurance for your launches, and the local chapter probably has a site or sites all set up and ready for launching, too!  Awesome ! Thanks! I’ll look into that.  Check the National Rocketry Association website. Should answer most of your questions. Have fun.
