 I've been working roughly 60 hours/week for 6+ months in New Jersey, and was told that after 90 days, we (staff of roughly 100 paying union members) were entitled to benefits. Our union president came by today for the first time and informed us that there will be a meeting next month to address our concerns, and then they will try to negotiate on our behalf for benefits, raises, etc., which means that we will not receive medical insurance until late this year at the earliest -- about 18 months after we were assured of benefits by the head of HR (who has since been fired). We have been paying union dues every pay period since we opened (July 2018), and they have yet to deliver on anything we were promised. What can we do here?
