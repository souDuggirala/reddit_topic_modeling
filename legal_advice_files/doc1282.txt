 My Ex (divorced 17 years) has never paid a dollar for her (now adult) kids. She is now in subsidized housing, and is a total hoarder. She is now sick, but no one wants any part of her problem. What are the responsibilities of next of kin in Massachusetts, who have no emotional connection, but are unlucky in being related by DNA? Like her kids? What to do with the crap she leaves behind in her apartment?? Who is legally responsible for this person's stuff in MA?
