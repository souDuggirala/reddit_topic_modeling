 Ive filed a complaint with department of labor and am listed as a creditor but the business itself doesn’t have many assets. is there anything i can do to ensure my payment? i’m in CA if that matters. this was a construction job and i’m also owed 3k in materials i bought which were used on the houses we were working on. i believe the owners paid for the material but i didn’t see a dime. is there anything i can do to get that money from them?  i was just an employee of the company - not a subcontractor. i’m going to see what i can do but i think i don’t qualify for submitting a lien
