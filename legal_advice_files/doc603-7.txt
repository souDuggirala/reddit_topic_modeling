Hey everyone, hoping to get some useful info.

&amp;#x200B;

**Backstory**

I was arrested for DUI in September. I messed up, I own that, and I'm not debating it. However, I will be attending my trail since it is my right, regardless If I had a lawyer or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I was released the next day, and retained my lawyer the next day through [avvo.com](https://avvo.com), because I was arrested in a different county, and I didn't know any other platform or resource to retain a lawyer. (After the fact, I realize that my name is in a database and probably every lawyer within a 100 mi radius sent me mail, but that's after the fact). This is my first (and last) DUI, so I wasn't aware of what exactly to do, and I didn't want to waste any time, so I did what I needed to do. My lawyer's ratings were great, so I felt good about contacting them. 

&amp;#x200B;

That whole process was smooth in the beginning. The lawyer sent me the retainer agreement which outlined the cost, what they would provide, and any additional costs if it extends further than the first hearing and court date. Since September to now, I've paid off my retainer fee. I also set up a private cloud hosted folder with all of my relating docs in there for the lawyer to have a record of just in case they didn't receive it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My lawyer attended my DMV phone hearing, and had my license determination pushed out until a date next year (I know when it is, I just don't want to put any other specifics unless necessary). My lawyer also attended my first court admin hearing, where they received the police report and all that stuff. So for now, I'm good to drive and carry on with life as usual. I have the temporary license sent from the DMV, which confirms that my lawyer completed that step. About a month ago, we also talked about meeting sometime this week, preferably Friday, to sign the plea paperwork and go over what is going to happen on my court date on the 10th.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Issue**

I've been trying to contact my lawyer since mid last week to confirm a date this week for us to meet and go over the trial before the actual date. I've left numerous text messages, called many times, at all points of the day, and their voicemail is full.

&amp;#x200B;

This is worrying, because I don't live in the same county that I was arrested in. That means I need to take time off of work and (possibly) get hotel arrangements for either Friday-Monday or Friday for a day and Sunday for a day, so that there's no issues with me arriving on time (whatever makes sense for me). I've paid my retainer fee in full, so there's no funds-related issue. I'm not sure what the problem may be. I understand that my lawyer has a million other things on their plate, but I really need to know what time we can meet, as well as when my court time is. I need to know this in a reasonable amount of time, so that I can tell my boss when exactly I will be off. I have all of my phone call attempts logged on my phone, as well as text messages (my phone is synced with my laptop, so even if my texts get deleted, there's a copy of each text on my laptop, I will even screenshot the entire text history and back it up on the cloud just to be safe). I know that my lawyer's phone is still powered on, because it rings to voicemail.

**Questions**

1. What do I do now? Should I just keep calling and texting until I get a response? I mean I obviously will, but this isn't working.
2. How do I verify my court time appearance for the 10th, is it as easy as just calling the courthouse?
3. In the event that I cannot get in touch with my lawyer by the 10th, what can I do to make sure that I don't look ignorant in court, and that I am as equipped as possible in representing myself in the best way possible? I have a suit, tie, nice black shoes, and I will be cutting my hair and shaving the night prior.

I know I messed up, and it sucks. But I feel that I am being as diligent and responsible as possible to make sure I'm not leaving my lawyer hanging.

Thank you for the helpful responses. Sorry, I just re-read your response. makes sense now. &gt; In the event my lawyer doesn't show, can I request a refund of all or some of my retainer fee?

Check your retainer agreement and see what it says.  [deleted] Go to court and if your lawyer doesn't show up, ask for a continuance based on absence of council - not that you haven't retained council, but that your lawyer is MIA.

In the meantime, you might want to consider hiring a different lawyer. Great, thank you!  &gt;Should I just keep calling and texting until I get a response?

I would call a reasonable amount.

&gt;How do I verify my court time appearance for the 10th, is it as easy as just calling the courthouse?

Or possibly checking their website.

&gt; that I am as equipped as possible in representing myself in the best way possible? 

"My attorney is not present, so I would like a continuance so that we can have this hearing with my attorney present." or something along those lines.
