 To preface I'm not too sure if this is the correct way to go about this, but I need a little advice. So I am currently sitting in the entrance terminal before security, having recieved an email that our flight had been changed from 1130 to 1015... Not a big deal because they sent us an email two days ago. I have been here since 0815 (it is currently 1030) to ensure that everything goes smoothly... However I have been told to wait since the plane needed maintenance. To top off the above statement the flight board shows the original 1130 flight time... And was set as "scheduled" and not "delayed" which makes me call into question the email which the one "trainee" behind the counter has no idea about. I have just been informed that we will have to continue to wait for the "maintenance" to be done. However there are customers here from a 6 am flight who are next to me saying their "maintenance" still isn't done either. I am not sure what to do since there is nobody usefull here, and everything is waiting to see if they can charter a different plane? This is a 3 hour flight, and I am in a different country with no idea what's going on. I want to enjoy my vacation :( You can contact customer service and find out what's going on.
