 My friend has an ex boyfriend who cannot get over her and has been doing subtle but harassing things since they broke up about a year ago. They were relatively harmless and mostly just sad/pathetic at first (ex. creating SC accounts with names like "ComeBackBbgirl" and sending her friend requests, creating IG accounts using her pics, contacting her friends, etc.) However, over time, it has gotten worse. Fast forward to the last few days, she and several of her friends (myself included) have been contacted by people from a website called Adult Friend Finder. The people I spoke to said they got my number from a profile on the website (all of them refused to give me the profile name). He has been giving our numbers out through that website and has presumably created profiles using our pictures/info. I'm also worried he may be doing a "revenge porn" type thing using his ex/my friend's pictures that he has saved. It's hard to verify though because a paid account is required to do almost anything, including looking at pictures on a profile. Is there any sort of legal action that can be taken against this individual? His behavior is just so deranged and we all want it to stop, especially since it has been ongoing for nearly a year now. I appreciate any advice.
