 My jet-ski was stolen on April of 2018, I did have insurance. Here is the problem. The insurance company only covered stolen jet ski's in a locked secure enclosure (gated fence, garage, etc). After Hurricane Irma (October of 2017), it knocked down my gate in my house. We didn't have any money to buy a whole new fence. So we temporarily installed a cemented anchor into the ground and put a padlock and a huge chain on it, until we can afford a new fence. The padlock was broken and then stolen. Police report was made, pictures were taken, and insurance contacted. They briefly sent a letter saying they denied my request to make a claim for the jet-ski. Reason: not in secure enclosure with proof of break in. Now I'm stuck paying the jetski off for the amount $13k with no help from the insurance company or lienholder. What can I do?  The police report should be evidence enough, but if your policy states clearly that it must be in a secure enclosure well if the building was still there well it sounds secure. I’d appeal the decision and if that doesn’t work contact a lawyer in your area.
