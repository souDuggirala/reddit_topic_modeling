 I just found out that I'm being sued by a collection agency. I was never served papers. I found out from an ad letter from an attorney. I'll probably end up hiring one to help lower the cost and all that but I wanted to ask what I should be aware of when choosing an attorney for this and any other advice. I'm in texas. I dont have any property except for my car. I know that there is no wage garnishment but my bank account can be garnished. I have a new bank account since this debt. Is there a way for them to find out what it is? Is there anything else I should know? There's not much point in hiring an attorney unless you have grounds to contest the charges. And unless we're talking about tens of thousands, you'd spend more on legal fees than you could possibly reduce the debt by anyway. The good news is you live in Texas, which is a debtor-friendly state. The worst they can do is nuke your credit rating. If you can pay at least a fraction of the debt you can negotiate a payoff. Or you can let them sue you and suffer bad credit for a time (while making it harder for you to move out out state).  NAL. Depends on how much you owe and other debtsm. But you may be better off claiming bankruptcy. A judgement will hurt your credit more and for longer. Also you won't need to pay this debt. And you can likely keep your car, unless you are driving a new luxury car or something
