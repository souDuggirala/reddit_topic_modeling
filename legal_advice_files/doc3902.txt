 So I posted here not that long ago, not sure how to tag my original post though. Long story short, my car was broken into and a firearm was stolen, which has since been recovered and used as evidence. I am aware that they keep it until the trail is over. As of several weeks ago, I found that it has concluded and the criminal has received his sentence. The state trooper who recovered it is not returning emails, phone calls or any form of contact from my local sheriffs office. The detective on my case isn’t happy about it, nor am I. Now that the case is over, I was told my property is no longer evidence and that I would get it back but they aren’t willing to be in contact with us in any way. What is my correct course of action here? Just wait and possibly never get it back? IANAL but it seems like there would be some legal issues with them withholding my property from me now that it isn’t needed for trail. The firearm cost about $2200.  Thanks for all the advice, the detective is playing middle man between me and the prosecuting office. I don’t really know anything about them other than them being located in SC.  I can’t contact them because I haven’t received any information on them. I don’t know who they are or what location aside from being a SC state troopers office.  Contact the Prosecuting Attorney to get the ball rolling, if that doesn't help contact your nearest elected official (Senator, Congressman, mayor, city councilman, ETC.) and see if they will help you. Elected officials are great at cutting through the red tape of bureaucracy and have incentive to help their constituents. I would also keep the detective on your case informed as well. Did you ever have any contact with the prosecuting attorney? They might be a good place to start.
