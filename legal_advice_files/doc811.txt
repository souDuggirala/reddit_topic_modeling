 They are saying that I didn't have the right to access the record which is not true, as the patient was under my care. They are saying that I should have gotten permission from someone to gather information to make the report. They are saying that I should've gone through the internal ethics agency before reporting to the state board. They are saying that because I did not go through our internal agency it looks like a personal vendetta. This sounds ridiculous. I removed PII from the report. I did leave diagnostic info that was relevant to the violations. I also left names of providers who could be potential witnesses. I'm hoping that I didn't make a mistake by including this info. I do not trust my agency and what they say anymore. I feel that they are upset that I made the report and this is retaliatory. Can anyone please advise?
