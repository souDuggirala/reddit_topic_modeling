 Hello all, I am not sure if this is the right subreddit. However, not too long ago a member of my family received an email saying they have her passwords and other personal information. They did add a part of a password which the family member used, however they say they have rude videos of her, yet she does not do "disgusting things" in front of her camera. I think this is false, but I want to confirm. []()
