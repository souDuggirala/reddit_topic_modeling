Hello,  I have a friend who received a Notice of Toll violation from the State of Delaware in the mail today.  It was dated for September 15th of this year, and said that payment is due on the 23rd of November.  However, there is an issue, obviously, because the ticket was received over a week after the fine was due, and now she apparently owes almost $40 more on the ticket.  What is the best way to go about an appeal/is there a way that it can be waived in part or entirely due to the delivery being unfairly delayed?  The form says that you can appeal the ticket but I know that often times that waives your ability to limit points being put on your license. The form says it has a “notice date” of November 2nd, envelope postmarked on the 8th. We can't tell you anything more than calling the issuing authority would tell you.  

In my past experience, if you call and offer to pay the full amount right away without the extra fine for being tardy, they generally waive it.

Also doesn't especially matter when you received it, legally, so much as when they sent it.  Look at the postmark on the envelope.  Did it get sent out before the deadline?
