 Hello, My father got a ticket from the MDX (a Florida tollway). The license plate did not match any that he has owned and neither is the car--we've never left Illinois. The ticket is minor ($1.34), but it seems like they also obtained a warning last year February 2nd. He's unaware of owning such a plate, and we don't really know what to do first or how to go about it. Thanks in advances (Current place: Chicago, IL) (Ticket: Florida)
