 Background: I got into a heated argument with my brother and father over the treatment of my mother. I had destroyed property (I broke a video game disc) and entered the room when they started arguing with my mother. My brother swung at me, started clawing, and I grabbed his wrists to defend myself. My father got in between us and my brother left to his room. I entered his room and continued the argument, my brother attacked me again. My father comes in and gets physical with me, I grab his wrists to defend myself and exit the room. Supposedly, marks were left on his wrists when I grabbed him, and pushing him off of me did knock him off balance. \- - - My problem: I'm not saying that I'm in any way in the right here. But I was arrested and charged with misdemeanor domestic abuse, due to testimony given that I had attacked my brother first. My mother is a witness to the argument before it led to my brother's room, and had said that she heard my brother yell first, and that my brother had said to her that he had swung first. To my knowledge, police did not question my mother at any point leading to the charges. \- - - My questions: 1) How and when do I get my mother's testimony added to the case? 2) what can I do about the victims in the case being dishonest to police? 3) Is there a case for me making a counter-charge against my brother? You sound like the aggressor here. You are certainly welcome to present witnesses for your defense. Hint: stop following people around when they try to get away from you. Itâ€™s not self defense if you try to pick fights and then restrain the people who try to break it up.
