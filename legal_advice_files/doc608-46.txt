I had some confusion with a college class, and apparently I DID have to pay, contrary to what I understood (that part doesn't matter, really).

Point is, I want to pay the whole amount off. It's a little under $200, so not much. I can afford to pay it right now easily. I live in Wisconsin, and heard that they won't give me my tax refund if I owe money. I don't know if this is true, but I would like to just pay the amount off all at once if it's possible, instead of them taking 13% until it's paid off. Where can I go to pay it off. I think it's too late to pay my college, so can I just pay the Wisconsin Department of Revenue, in full, directly, somehow? I went to the school and paid. Hopefully that clears it all up. I have a receipt to dispute any garnished wages from here on out. You should be able to pay them directly, but you'll almost certainly need to talk to someone there to make sure you do it right. There's likely specific paperwork you'll need to fill out. So call my school? They're the ones that told me what was going on. I had no clue anything was happening until they told me today. They don't know much, only that they got a letter from the Wisconsin Department of Revenue, and the amount they need to take from my paychecks. I appears so from what I found out from my employer. Is the Wisconsin Department of Revenue the one who is handling the debt? You might ask your employer if they can provide you the details of the garnishment. You want to call the original debtor to see who owns the debt now, if not them.
