 Hello, about a month or so ago I purchased a cheap desktop off Walmart's website. By accident, a second computer was shipped to my address. Further, it was revealed to me there are no records the computer was even sent out, therefore preventing a return. Given these circumstances, would selling the computer be perfectly legal? Thanks.  Except that references when something is not ordered but is purposely sent with the intention of demanding payment. That does not cover if something is sent to you unintentionally. This was clearly a mistake. But you are correct, as Walmart cannot force you to pay for the item. They, however, can ask you send it back. That’s not what this law means at all. It applies to unsolicited merchandise, like if a company you’ve never ordered from before ships you something, not if a company you did place an order from accidentally sends you something extra. If Walmart tells you to keep the computer, you may sell it. If you failed to make them aware and they realize, they can charge you for the 2nd computer.  [removed] Selling the computer should be legal, as long as you are prepared to pay for the erroneous shipment if Walmart contacts you to send it back.
