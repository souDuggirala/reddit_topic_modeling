 Hey everyone! I want to create a personal blog (a private one, no one will have acces to it, except my friends) and I am wondering if is legal to use public personalities photo (Prime Ministers, Ministers, Celebrities, Writers etc) as cover photo for some of my articles, saying other things.. For example, i will say that a guy named David Wayne did something, and on the cover photo will be David Cameron. Is it legal, as long as i take Creative Commons photos and no one can see them, except a few of my friends?
