 So my very close friend who is a girl, told me about how she was allegedly "raped" last summer by her ex boyfriend. Now I know this girl and she DEFINETLY wouldnt be the type to lie about this. I know who the guy is too. Problem is she never reported it to the police. She told her mom and her mom knows about it, but her dad doesnt know. She was always to scared to report it to the police and time passed and she kinda just let it go. Now dont get me wrong I want to punch this motherfucker in the face and get him locked up, but what do I do in this situation? Report him to the police without telling her? She doesnt want to report him, because shes terrified of the whole thing and just wants to forget about it. But I know as long as that mother fucker walks around free, It will always bother me. What do I do. Help. Ultimately, your only real option is to respect and support her in her endeavors. Don't force the issue on her. Nobility, in this particular circumstance doth naught but ill. It is Her life. Only she has the power to bring such a creep to "justice"/ light.  Yes report it- while she didnâ€™t , what if he has or will do it again ?  You do nothing. This is her decision, not yours. It is not your job to decide for this woman what should happen to her rapist. I get that you want to help but to step in would actually be disrespectful of her wishes as a victim. I recognize that your heart is in the right place here but forcing your friend to confront her rape and relive it through police interviews is another kind of violation. Be supportive of her, make sure she knows you will support her no matter what, but also be supportive of her choices.  You should refrain from doing so without the consent and support of the victim. Is is nearly assured that the police can do nothing without her consent and support, and your report will do little or nothing.
