 Hello I was overpaid $1000 in salary by my previous employer back in August during a leave of absence. I just got a letter today, which is the first I’ve heard about it. I also received a letter saying that I owe $150 for my health insurance cost during the same time period, that they paid on my behalf. I have no problem at all paying them, as they’re 100% legit. However, they sent it to collections before I even got the letter. So I’m really wondering what can they legally do to get me to pay this back? And I wanted to know will this type of collection negatively impact my credit? Will it even show on my credit? I assume not because I did not request a credit from them and not pay it back. This is a mistake on their end of course. Just worried mainly if this will effect my credit. Thank you! Sure. Try hard for the pay for delete. Thank you for your help! [removed] Yeah, it'll very likely end on your report at some point. Ok. Also once it is sent to a collection agency will it for sure be on my credit? Or if I paid it asap will that not show.? The agency called me for the first time yesterday and left no voicemail. I just assume it’s related to the employment debt. They overpaid you, and you owe that back. The money is/was not yours to keep/use. If it was sent to collections, it can show up on your credit report.  Yes it will trash your credit. And they can sue you and get a judgmental which will trash it more. Negotiate a pay for delete and get it in writing.
