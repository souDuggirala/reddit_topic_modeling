 i'm from iran. what is the easiest way to get out of here and in what modern country its easy to become citizen from iran  Unfortunately, if you're Muslim, you probably won't be getting into the US anytime soon. If that's the case (and assuming you want to get outside the Middle East), you might want to look further into asylum in Canada. They're also immigrant friendly and there's a decent sized Iranian population depending where you go.  Could you apply to a school in a western country and try to get a student visa? If you can get a degree in that country you stand a good chance of getting a job there and a visa for that. Then you can try and apply for citizenship while you work.  Thank You The easiest way to get another country to let you in would be to claim asylum, but the requirements for that vary by country and depend a good bit on who you are. Are you a member of a religious minority facing persecution for your beliefs? LGB? Do you have an in demand skill set you could use to apply for work in another country? As to the question of getting out of the country, that's less of a legal question, and depending on your circumstances may require a strictly non-legal (from the perspective of the Iranian government) solution. /r/IWantOut may be helpful.
