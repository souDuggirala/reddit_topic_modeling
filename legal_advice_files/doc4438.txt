 I'm working construction in Austin Texas down by the airport. The site that I'm working at is blatantly dumping/releasing trillions of particles of styrofoam around the site and its blowing off onto the highway and out into the world. I know that its highly illegal to dump non-biodegradable substances out into the environment. My question is who should I report this to? I already filed one with the EPA but should I report them to osha? Pr ain't my department, I show up, run wire, go home. I just dont want this contributing to pollution that's already taking over this city. http://www.austintexas.gov/environmentalinspections Since it's near an airport you might want to look up the public information officer for the airport and let them know it's been reported to TCEQ. You can say something like, just letting you know in case this turns into a public relations or cleanup issue for you.
