 My mother in law lives in a small, backwoods town. Yesterday she was driving to work during a snow storm and she was hit by a plow truck. She's fine but her vehicle is pretty messed up. The driver admitted that he was at fault, said he didn't see her, and have his statement to the police. This happened on a state road, and it was a township snowplow. I'm not sure if it matters, but the snowplow was not clearing the road when it happened, he was just heading from one part of the town to another and took the state road. Anyway, my mil was just told that their insurance isn't going to pay for damages because they're claiming 'government immunity.' I had never heard of this before. Does she have any legal recourse at all? She has full coverage, but since it wasn't her fault will they still cover any of this without her insurance going up? I'm just going off of what my mil told me, but this sounds off. Five years ag she was involved in another accident, AGAIN with a snowplow, in the same town, and they covered her damages. During that accident, the snowplow ran a stop sign and hit her. She has no clue what she's doing and I've never been in anything worse than a fender bender...I'm clueless about this sort of thing. Thanks for any advice you're able to give! She lives in the US (Pa if it matters).  You should post in r/insurance and ask them. Government immunity may well be a valid defense. She should report this to her insurance company to handle. If her insurance wants to pursue the township they can.  If she has collision insurance, then she should file a claim with her company.
