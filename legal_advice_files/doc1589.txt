 Backstory: My husband and I were married for 8 years, and are still best friends. My partner (best friend since kindergarten) and I are wanting to have a baby, but we're both female. I already have two perfect children, both boys (5/6), and I would really love if my (willing) ex husband could be my sperm donor. Is this possible? What are some positives and negatives?  It kind of depends on how he'll be donating the sperm. If you all work through a clinic, he should be fine. If he donates "conventionally," he'll be on the hook for child support since he's the father. This topic comes up here fairly often. Turns out "directed sperm donation" is a thing. It's no different than any other sperm donor. A lawyer should draft an agreement, and the donation should be done through a doctor's office or clinic via artificial insemination. This seems like more of an r/relationships question than legal advice.
