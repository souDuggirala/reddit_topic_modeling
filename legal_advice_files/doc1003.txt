 They submitted a request, got turned down, and then had to spend 2 years suing the government. All to get 30 year old information about a Salvadoran. That was my point. The CIA doesn't turn over much of anything until a court orders them to, and getting that to happen takes years and lots of money. Not according to this:  It's going to get denied regardless (or redacted to infinity) because the CIA's stance on FOIA is and always has been "No, and have fun suing us." Does it really matter? If the CIA is interested they will figure it out either way, and if the information you request is even remotely sensitive your request is getting denied.
