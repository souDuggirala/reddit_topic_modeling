 I am in the military and was traveling across the US via POV. My address still shows my original home up north and now I am in the SW (where the ticket came from). I apparently was going 22 in a 15 school zone and got a $300 fine. The only way I found out was a family member got the mail from whomever lives in the old address who knew who I am by name. The state the camera ticket came from is AZ if that helps. What do I do? I have not had a ticket since 2011 and am not clear on the laws with cameras. I have heard the rumor/myth about being able to ignore it, is that true? What about the fact technically it was sent to an old address and I never would have seen it had the new homeowner not known a family member of mine? tl;dr - camera ticket went to old address, what do i do? Thanks.
