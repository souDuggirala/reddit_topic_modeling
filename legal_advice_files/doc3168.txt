 Hi everyone, hope you all had a merry xmas! I’m writing this on behalf of my parents who have only just arrived home from the Dominican Republic as there was severe delays. They had a 46 hour delay and had a 6000 mile journey from Punta Cana International Airport to London Gatwick. Now I know I’ve said Gatwick and I completely comprehend that people are going to quickly say that “it’s an act of god” that a drone ruined so many flights and that it’s not the airlines fault BUT that’s not the case here... The reason the flight got delayed was because of a technical issue with the plane. (Pilot confirmed this) The initial delay was an hour and then 4 hours and so on and so forth until there was a 46 hour delay... This was also due to flight attendants not flying as they had already maxed their allotted “air hours” TUI have accepted full fault for this and have encouraged people to seek compensation... They completely missed Xmas but I managed to convince my niece that Xmas is actually tomorrow so all is good! Any advice Reddit?
