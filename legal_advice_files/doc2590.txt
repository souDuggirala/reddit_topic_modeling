 Inspired by this [thread](=3) from "LPT: If a company has a chat feature, chat with a representative instead of calling. Then save your chat transcript. That way you have written proof in the even a company tries to screw you over about a service."  That depends entirely on the circumstances and what the customer service representative was committing to. In some cases, it could serve as evidence of a commitment from the CSR's employer. In others (for example, if the CSR went rogue and committed the company to something that he had no business committing it to), it would not be particularly persuasive.
