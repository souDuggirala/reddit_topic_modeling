 So, I went into a gun store with a relative of mine today and she went to buy two handguns of the same kind - one for me and one for her. She's never had any felony convictions, she isn't a user of marijuana, she hasn't been convicted of domestic violence. However, on question 11c it asks: Have you ever been convicted in any court of a felony, or any other crime for which the judge could have imprisoned you for more than one year, even if you received a shorter sentence including probation? This is the question that worries me, as she marked 'no' on it. Here's why it worries me, wall of text ahead and will put a TL;DR at the bottom. In March of 2017 she went on a vacation with us to Washington D.C. This vacation, from the start, went pretty horribly wrong. She got into an argument with a hotel worker, and things escalated to yelling. No punches were thrown, and it didn't get physical. Some time during the argument, something happened in an elevator and the hotel worker claimed she was not allowed by my relative to leave the elevator. The police took her word and gave her a felony kidnapping charge and a disorderly conduct charge. Over the course of a few days, in which some really horrific things happened to her in her holding cell, which I won't go into right now - she was arraigned and the felony kidnapping charge dropped. She went back for trial that May after she got out on bond. She was convicted of disorderly conduct, and given 1 year of probation. There may have been a 2-year extension to that if she broke probation? I don't know about that last bit there, but there was definitely one year of probation. This happened in Alexandria, Virginia. We live in Missouri. She checked 'no' on question 11c of the form as we thought that a disorderly conduct charge wouldn't really count. Her background check was delayed today and she wasn't really given a reason as to why - only that it was delayed. I've read that this can be for a myriad of things, one of them being that she, about thirty years ago lived in D.C. I've also heard that delays can lead to denials and subsequent arrest. I'm worried sick right now that she may have accidentally committed a serious crime and something like this can ruin the rest of her life.  If a NICS check is delayed and no action is taken within 3 business days, it is within the FFL dealer's discretion whether or not to transfer the firearm. It's entirely within their rights to sell it under the Brady Act, they just have to check off that no decision was returned. Also, the USC is looking at punishable jail time, not probation. You would have to look up the punishment for that class of misdemeanor in the location she was convicted. Excellent question. I am not a lawyer, she should consult one on what exactly to do in this circumstance. My best advice would be to not purchase the firearm is the background check is not explicitly returned as "approved". 18 USC 922(g) makes it unlawful to possess a firearm if she meets any of the statutory requirements, regardless of whether or not the background check was completed. If she cannot lawfully own a gun, and purchases one anyways, it is incredibly likely that she can and will be charged with felony in possession, as well as lying.  Federally licensed firearms dealers have access to a DOJ program known as [NICS]() Though you are filling out a piece of a paper, the dealer will go to a computer and run an instant background check. The results will be returned immediately. NICS works with another program, called NCIC, which is a law enforcement database that provides detailed information about criminal convictions. If the firearms dealer was not able to complete the background check, that could be a bad thing. As I said, these background checks are instant, and her background check was held by the FBI instead of being returned. This is not uncommon. Nearly 9% of all NICS background checks are not returned instantly, instead being manually reviewed by the FBI. Only about 1% of background checks are denied outright. This only happens when someone has blatantly put information on their background check that prohibits them from purchasing a firearm. The other 7.9% are cases where manual reviews are approved, or "not completed". When a background check is not completed, there are two reasons. Either A.) 72 hours have passed and no FBI official has had time to review the check, in which case the sale is allowed to proceed but could still be illegal or B.) An FBI official has determined that someone has lied. TLDR: The FBI will either be looking or not looking at her background check. Either she can legally purchase the gun, she can't and the FBI won't say anything (in which case the purchase is still illegal), or she lied and the FBI will pursue charges. Hope this helped! EDIT: If the dealer says that the background check could not be completed, you should not follow through on the purchase. Only follow through with your purchase if the dealer explicitly states the background check was completed and approved.
