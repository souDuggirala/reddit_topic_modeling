 Hello everyone, this is my first time posting on r/legaladvice. On my friends property he has a house and a garage on the side of a hill which is about 2 acres of land. Although on the east side of the property there is a cliff that has a thirty foot drop. At the base of the cliff there is a constantly running stream. My question is if the possibility of a sinkhole/mudslide happens is he liable for potentially disrupting the stream below? In regards to water particulates and/or pollution to the state water supply? If so would the state come in proactively to fix the potential sinkhole/mudslide? Potentially yes, if the mudslide or sinkhole damages someone's property they should definitely expect to be sued. In terms of whether the stream would need to be restored and who pays for that is highly dependent on the specific facts as well as state and local law.
