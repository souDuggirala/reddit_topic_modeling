  A relative is a professional dominatrix. During a holiday visit, I looked at her phone when she was out of the room. There was a conversation with someone who was apparently planning a session for someone else, who I at first figured might be this person's significant other. But then it became clear that this was a mother planning a session for her underage son (his birthday was mentioned, and they were both on social media). It sounded like they were already acquainted and had perhaps had a previous session. Presumably there is no actual sex involved, but is it generally legal for an adolescent to be erotically dominated, even with a parent's permission and oversight? My guess is that it isn't, but I want to be sure of that before I talk to my relative about this. I know I shouldn't have snooped, and she'd probably be upset about that, but this is important. Off the cuff....I can’t imagine a professional dominatrix would put herself in legal hot water over a minor. Also, you violated her client’s privacy and her privacy by snooping, which generally is far more egregious than a minor wanting to be spanked (or something else) by a pro. They count on confidentiality, and you knew what she did for a living. But exactly what do you think is illegal about a minor consenting to a SECOND domme session with parental approval, given that there is no sexual contact? It’s not illegal for a minor to get a massage with parental approval...or be waxed or pierced in an intimate area with parental approval. Why would it be illegal in this case to have someone touch / speak to a minor without sexual contact, with parental approval? Just because it turns them on? And a massage somehow doesn’t? But what YOU did is illegal - by accessing her client messages, without her consent, on her communications device, again, without her consent.
