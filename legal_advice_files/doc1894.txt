 I work for a small nonprofit 501(c)(3) and they have offered me either a raise or the same gross amount in an additional employer contribution to my 403(b) retirement account. (The company plan already includes employer non discretionary contribution as well as soon as matching contribution.) Does ERISA allow an employer to offer a single employee this additional 403(b) benefit, when it's not available to any other employees? (Obviously I'd rather take the retirement contribution because taxes.)
