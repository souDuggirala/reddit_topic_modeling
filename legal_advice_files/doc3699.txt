 Is it possible to leave the United States and return from Europe with an expired greencard? I am currently in the process of my citizenship and have applied about 2 months ago. But, it does complicate the matter. Within about 2-3 weeks of filing my extension application. If you haven’t got one give them a call and they’ll send another.  No, it's not. Someone's status as a permanent resident does not terminate simply because their green card has expired. How soon did you receive your I-797? I’m going through immigration right now, my 2yr GC has expired and my application for 10yr extension hasn’t even been looked at yet because USCIS is on a go-slow. I’ve left the country and returned with my expired GC, and plan to do so again in Feb. Plenty of people in my situation have done the same and had NO problem because immigration officials are trained for these situations. Assuming you’ve gone thorough the correct process and have a case pending you should have an I-797 form extending your GC for 12/18 months. If you do and it’s valid, you can enter with your passport, expired GC, and that form. Nobody will give you any trouble over it. If you don’t have that form or it’s expired you need to go to your local USCIS/FBI field office and get an I-551 stamp in your passport. Again arriving with that at a US port will be fine and nobody will deny you entry on that basis. You can certainly leave, but border agents have wide discretion in allowing foreign nationals into the country. The fact that your green card has expired is all the more reason to deny you entry.
