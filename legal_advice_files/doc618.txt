 Additional details: police came last night but we chose to not have him arrested. He is a severe alcoholic, is there any way to get him into a psychiatric nursing home or something like that long term? Supposedly insurance will cover a regular psychiatric hospital due to his alcoholism and severe depression but we're wondering if there is a more permanent solution. Also, he is trying to get on disability (for whatever reason). If he does, would my mom have to pay alimony because she is working? She works as a nurse like 35 hours a week or so. Furthermore, they have a house together. If they sell it, does my mother get a share? Also, he paid her share of the mortgage, so would she have to pay him back? Just looking into any insight on how my mother can have the best possible outcome from this. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Assuming you are in the US, you should both file a restraining order to get him removed from the home. How long has he been out of work? Where are you located (country/state)?
