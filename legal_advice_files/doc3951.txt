 If you were to have a legal document of some kind to allow a specific person to kill you. If they were to follow through would it be illegal? (i have no idea what i’m talking ab if you couldn’t tell lmao.) That generally wouldn't be the same as murder, though it obviously depends on circumstances (i.e. if you deliberately got yourself on life support so that someone else would pull the plug, you're getting into a greyer area). If circumstances were sketchy enough, and there's evidence that the other person knew about your plan and deliberately participated in it with the ultimate intention of killing you, you could potentially get to illegality. Otherwise, the legality of pulling the plug, and the circumstances under which it's ok to pull the plug, vary from state to state. would it be legal to ask someone to pull the plug on life support, would it be the same as murder? thanks man was always curious That would definitely be illegal in the United States (contract killing would still be murder). I can't speak to the laws in any other countries, though.
