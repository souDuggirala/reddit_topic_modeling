I'll do my best to keep this short... My now ex-fiance accepted a job in New Mexico. He did not have a laptop, so I offered to let him borrow my spare until he got a few paychecks and could buy his own. The plan was I would join him in a few weeks time, but the relationship ended, and now he is refusing to to return my laptop to me. I work from home, and it was my spare back up laptop. It's nothing fancy, but something I paid for myself and need around in case of a problem with my usual laptop. I even offered to give him the money to ship it back to me. His response is I could fly out there and pick it up myself.

Is there anything I can do from a legal perspective to get my property back? I don't know if the police or anyone would care that much over a \~$500 laptop. But it is mine, it has work related programs/info on it, and I would like it back. Thank you for your reply. I will take a look at those options. You can:

1. Take him to small claims to recover the value of your laptop.
2. Spend thousands of dollars to obtain a court order for the police to seize the laptop, if it contains something valuable.

You cannot:

1. Report him for theft.
