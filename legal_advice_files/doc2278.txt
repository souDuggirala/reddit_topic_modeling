 Does anyone here have experience with changing back your last name on your marriage license? (For example, if you thought you wanted to change your last name but then decided not to after getting married.) Asking for my sister. She canâ€™t seem to find anything online and Vital Statistics told her to call the court house who then told her to call Vital Statistics. She was not pleased. If anyone could help us we would appreciate it! Thanks! [removed] Your sister would need to fill out an Affadavit and Order Restoring Name (Pursuant to K.S.A. 23-2716) http://www.kansasjudicialcouncil.org/legal-forms/adult-name-change/affidavit-and-order-restoring-name-pursuant-ksa-23-2716 I'd recommend your sister calling one of the legal resources listed in that link to get some assistance for filling it out the form because if she has questions they would be able to provide her with some assistance or answer legal questions. Good luck!
