 Hey. Two weeks ago my class and I rented this "hall" for a party, which is a tradition at my school. It was, of course, expensive and naturally we also had to give a deposit. After the party there were only minor issues, like a broken trashcan, fair enough. Now two weeks later the man responsible for the place writes us an email about broken windows with footprints on them. Naturally we recon this as being a bit peculiar as we have communicated with him several times in these weeks and heard nothing about this. Also, naturally others could have commited this act of vandalism in this spand of time. Now, we live in Denmark so I'm not sure if that changes anything. Any help regarding this matter is appreciated deeply. Thank you.
