 Hi everyone, let me preface this by saying this is the first time I've ever had any trouble with my professor. I've taken lessons with him since high school and know him pretty well. At the beginning of the fall semester I mentioned to him that I was thinking of selling one of my horns, and he said he might be interested. I wasn't playing on that horn at the time so I had no problems letting him hold onto it for a while before he made his decision. He eventually told me he wanted it, and we agreed on a price of $1800 about a month and a half ago. Our last lesson of the year I brought it up again and he said he'd be able to get me at least half before the semester ended, which I said was fine. I haven't heard from him since that last lesson. I sent him a text on the 6th, 14th, and today and he won't answer my calls. He sent a 'Merry Christmas' mass text to everyone in the trumpet studio on the 25th so I know his phone is working. I'm just not sure what to do here, I've had nothing but a good relationship with him and I don't want to cause any drama. However he's had the horn all semester and used it in all of his gigs since. I could have easily sold it by now and I'm about ready to take it back. Next time I know I'll see him is when the spring semester starts, and I really don't know if I should just show up to his house before then or something. I would send him a certified letter demanding the return of your trumpet or full payment within X period of days. You certainly could go to his house one time, knock on the door, and ask for your trumpet back. Don't do this over and over because it will start to be harassment. If he fails to be responsive, you can either go to the school itself, or you can file a lawsuit in small claims court. You may wish to send him a written demand letter first, demanding return of trumpet or payment; otherwise, you will need to file a report with the police or escalate it in the department.
