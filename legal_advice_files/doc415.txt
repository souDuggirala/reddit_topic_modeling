 My husband recently started working (about 4-5 months ago) at local pizza joint. He's a delivery driver, only scheduled to work 3-3.5 hours on weekdays. They frequently send him home early (against his wishes) but say they're too busy to count out his tips and fees right then so he'll have to come back later. Advice? (Also pretty sure at least one manager shorts him when she does this) Location: AR
