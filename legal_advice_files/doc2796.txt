 My ex had taken me back to court after our divorce because she couldn’t get money from my retirement until I retire. The magistrate decided that she’s going to have to wait. She filed an objection. My quick question(knowing that anything could happen) is what are the chances of the judge to just side with the magistrate’s decision and end the trial? Or do you think I will have to go back to trial? Thanks!! From my understanding the judges really have no power here; the pension rules are set up by whatever agency controls the pension. I know after my parents split my mom didn't collect on my dad's pension until after he retired b/c of the rules about fedgov pensions. I would ask my attorney about the likelihood of getting your attorney fees paid by her since the pension issue is outside the realm of family court; there was no way she was going to win it. Yeah. It’s a pension.  To be clear, this is a pension, and not an investment account like an IRA or 401k where she would just take her half and go away?
