 I lived in an apartment complex in Oregon for a few years, and recently decided to move to another apartment complex in Oregon. Before I decided to move, my current complex served me notice that my rent would be going up $50 if I renewed my lease. I have since given notice that I will be leaving next month, and the complex has listed my unit on their website for $100 less than what I'm paying now, $150 less than what they would have me paying if I stayed. I didn't think much of this until I mentioned to the leasing agent at my new complex. The agent suggested that this behavior on the part of my former complex might be illegal, and I should look into the matter. Did anything illegal transpire here? Do I have any case/claim against my soon-to-be former apartment complex? On the surface and notwithstanding any other local regulations, this is totally legal. Often times a landlord will use small increases over market to test increases to the market rate. That said, it tends to piss off current tenants if vacant units are marketed under the amount they are paying.  No, there is nothing illegal about charging more to older tenants. Sometimes apartments lower rates initially and then raise them as time goes on.  Why would this be illegal? Businesses sell items and write contracts for different amounts all the time. Your neighbor could be living in his identical apartment for half of what you are paying and it is perfectly okay.
