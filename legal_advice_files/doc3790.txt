 Yes,I’ll admit that i was driving beyond the speed limit.If i had the money to pay for my ticket ill pay it but I sadly am not made of money.So Imma try to get it dismissed.The problem am having is what do i pled not guilty or guilty.How to do i exactly tell the judge that I’m innocent.Could i have my ticket dismissed if I simply tell the judge that “i know what i did was wrong and I never gotten in trouble with the law i been safe driver. “ ...........(i hope who ever is reading this understand what im trying to say)  Posting on a public forum admitting your guilt and providing the state with evidence against you isn’t the best idea if you’re going to attempt to plead Not Guilty.
