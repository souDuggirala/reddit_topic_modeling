 I'm in Canada so it's legal for me to have weed in my system obviously but this company is based in the US. Just wondering if I should spend the money to get a masking kit or not. I'll be working for the company as a driver if that matters. Thanks in advance for any clarification or help you can offer. I was totally aware that a drug test would be required. But not sure if I would be disqualified for something that is legal here. And those cleanse and masking kits have worked for me in the past so I would have to disagree with you on your first point. Probably. Drug screenings are very unusual in Canada unless the job is safety sensitive, such as operating heavy equipment.  Fair point. I definitely agree that buying the kit is a waste of money. I wonder if OP couldn't find a way to postpone the test long enough to pee clean It also gives OP the opportunity to not take the test and have future deniability. If they take it and fail, there is no guarantee it doesn't damage future opportunities. It should be private, but the world sucks sometimes Maybe so. But look at it this way. If they're drug testing for it, they're going to find it anyway and deny him the job. If they're not concerned about it, then it's not an issue to ask. And no one here should be recommending any sort of masking kit, because they're both ineffectual and fraudulent.  Is that a good idea? I would imagine that would raise a red flag for HR.  You can reach out to the employer HR to ask what their policies are for weed use in your country. Those popular drug kits really don't work as well as advertised. Were ypu somehow unaware that the job required a drug screening?
