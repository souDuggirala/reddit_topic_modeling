 The father of my child has been in and out of his life. When we split took 3 months off from being a father and had to be constantly reminded that he has a son. Get new gf wants to be father of the year. There's no established paternity, no court orders for visitation, no child support etc. Let him have our son for a week of visitation because he had vacation time off of work. Refused to give my child back filed for emergency custody was denied made false allegations to my living conditions. Cops won't help me take my son back. It's been 2 months. Have custody pretrail tomorrow. Is it a good idea to ask the judge for a paternity test? I just want my son back. cPS had visited. Have to wait for her to come back with release forms for me and my fiance to sign so she can access medical records, counseling records etc. As I said though court is on the 2nd. And I just want my son back. I have never gone more then 2-3 days without him and these last 2 months with zero contact have been hell. His father has refused to contact me. Refused to let me see him etc. No legal question asked. Post removed.
