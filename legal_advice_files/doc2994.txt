 Posting for a dear friend: Ex-Boyfriend maxed out my credit cards and emptied my checking account using my debit card. I am also listed as a co-signer on his car loan although my name is not on the title that I know of. Now the bank is saying that he has stopped making payments on the car. I was in a poor mental state during the time he took advantage of me and was actually admitted to a psychiatric facility for suicide ideation. I am mentally fine now, but my credit has suffered tremendously and I am stuck paying off the debts. Do I have any legal recourse against him? I know I can't get my money back but I would at least like to get my name off his car loan. Sure you do, you also may have a claim for what he took from checking. Figure out how much you lost if its under small claims pursue that, otherwise talk to an attorney. Look for DV resources, they may be able to assist you.
