 I'm 30, male, and a college student in Kansas. I currently have crisis insurance with a $7500 deductable, and a policy that doesn't help much with co-pays. I ruptured my Achilles tendon a month ago. I'll have to pay a lot out of pocket, and the deductible will reset in a little over a month (start of the new year). Being a broke college student, I shop for healthcare every year on Healthcare.gov. I'm thinking of going with a higher quality insurance because I'll definitely be making multiple doctor visits next year. I guess my question is, is being injured and choosing a more expensive plan to get better coverage legal? And if so, is the coverage I get legally required help me since I busted my leg before having the nicer plan? (The better coverage is through my current provider by the way). Thank you for your time. TLDR - if I have a pre existing condition, can I legally get better coverage for the next year, and is that coverage legally obligated to cover my expenses even though it's a pre existing condition? If you are purchasing a Marketplace plan during open enrollment, you can choose any plan on there, and there are no restrictions on pre-existing conditions so they are obligated to cover any expenses that are otherwise covered by the plan. What you are proposing is completely legal. [Cite]()
