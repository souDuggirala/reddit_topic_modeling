 Factory in Ohio has had a water main break. The water has been shut off. Meaning no water to fire suppression systems, safety showers, boiler, sinks, toilets, etc. They have provided drums of water for flushing toilets, washing hands, eye wash, things of that nature.  Call up OSHA.  Call OSHA or your local code enforcement office and ask. It's possible that if there's no safety showers or fire suppression that the place isn't up to code and will have to shut down until that's remedied.
