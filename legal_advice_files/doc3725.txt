 My apartment building’s garage door lowered into the hood of my car and scratched it while looking for my key card. This caused damage to the door as well - not sure how much yet but I’m wondering whether I will have to pay. The building manager has suggested that I will be responsible. The event: As I was looking for my key card with my car in park, the door lowered onto the hood of my car so I backed out. Once the door was all the way down, I found my keycard and tried to re-enter. As the door went back up, it appeared to come off the rails. What are my options?  Well, since it appears to be completely your fault, they'll likely be right. Regardless, it's the proper, legal first step. I think my insurance company would rather it be my fault so they don’t have to pay a claim - difficult to look to them for an objective view  Start with your insurance company. Your liability will be determined by if you did anything negligent to cause this.
