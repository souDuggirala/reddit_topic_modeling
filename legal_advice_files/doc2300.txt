 Hey y’all, quick question and happy New Years! So, I got a new job and all that good stuff. I told my landlord I wanted to discuss terminating the lease early and she said that was okay and she would get back to me with costs. Then at 4:27pm the landlord’s realtor voided the entire lease. At 4:44 the same realtor sent me a termination agreement. If they voided the lease before I signed anything should I sign the termination agreement? Isn’t the void lease unenforceable so can they terminate an already voided lease? Am I basically extremely lucky and free from my lease since they voided it?  Oh bummer yea it’s on the DocuSign portal thing. Sounds like I’m going to sign! So much for NYE luck huh? Haha thank you! Since you're so specific with time, I'll assume this is some kind of online portal. I think that "void" is an internal status marked by the realtor. It just means "in their system, it has been marked as void". They can just as easily unvoid it with another click. It's not a legal status, just an operational status. So sign the termination agreement if you agree to the terms. If you don't agree to the terms, then don't sign it.  They can’t unilaterally void the lease. What exactly happened at 4:27 that makes you think they did?
