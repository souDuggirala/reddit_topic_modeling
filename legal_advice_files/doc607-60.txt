My dad has battled bipolar disorder/multiple personality disorder for awhile. He has gone in and out of the hospital a few times. He went on a few binges and bought a motorcycle and took off and toured the US, he lost his job, couldn’t get a psychiatrist to keep him on because he’d threaten them, and bought lots of frivolous things while my mom frantically followed behind him picking up the pieces. He has no memory of any of this. He finally got stable, found a good medication that works, and got his job back. 

We thought all was finally well until we got a call from the IRS that we owe them 15-30k from early withdrawal fees, interest, and taxes since my mom never included that money in her tax filings. She didn’t know he even did that and we have no idea where it went. Obviously, we plan on paying the money we have to back, but we’d like to avoid paying the extras for not reporting it. 

We have all the documentation from my dad being admitted to the hospital. They were nice and said my mom could file a report with everything and it should be fine but she just told me it looks like they’re denying everything. They don’t really have any money for a lawyer as they spent their savings when he was out of a job and now have a ton of medical debt. Is there anything I can do?  [deleted] [removed]
