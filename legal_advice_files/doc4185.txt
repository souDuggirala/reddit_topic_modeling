 We have texts between ourselves and the roommate with him acknowledging that he knows what he owes us and that he has to pay us and that he is going to , but for the past month and a half he is been completely dodging us. The bill is in my boyfriends name though . But like I said we have texts from him saying he would pay . We are being really chill because he is going through some shit , but we both know that if the roles were reversed he would be NOWHERE near as nice as we are being . My boyfriend has been friends with this guy for over 10 years and is trusting he will pay us back but based on prior actions of this ex roommate I am nervous we just lost $500.
