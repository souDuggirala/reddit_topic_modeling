 I bought some equipment in Centennial, Colorado. I had to hire riggers to load and unload the truck on each end and a broker to book the over the road company to haul the equipment. The broker was in San Diego, CA and I’m in Indiana. The truck driver showed up on time, but was unprepared and ended up leaving without the load and without telling anyone. The rigger offered to bring a truck down to haul to his yard for overnight and transfer when the new driver showed up. The broker asked how much, and I responded $115/hr plus transfer fee. He said this was fine, so we did it. The load was transferred and delivered with no issue, and the invoice from the rigger came back nearly double ($6700 vs $3400) due to delays caused by driver. The broker said he thought I said the extra fee was $150 and is refusing to work with me to meet in the middle of the extra cost. The broker was paid up front via wire. Would my local Indiana court, the court at the site in Colorado or their local court in San Diego be the appropriate venue for a small claims suit? Or am I out of luck, and that’s how the trucking business works?
