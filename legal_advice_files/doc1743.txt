 So... I called this junk car removal service and I talked to the owner on the phone and he said give him an address and he'd be there within the hour. The amount he would give me was small under 200. He continues to put me off, over and over, it's getting dark, and eventually I just stop hearing from him all together. I say he needs to be there by certain time or I have to leave, no word. So I schedule another business that is way more professional. I text the guy sorry but I'm going with another business. 30 min later he acts like Im the bad guy, says his phone died, excuse after excuse and tries to lie saying he never said an hour, this is three hours later from initial call. He gets butt hurt and and threatens to call cops on me for theft of services saying we had verbal contract. And gets aggressive and just rude. I already have another business scheduled so the cars gonna be gone tomorrow anyhow, but I don't wanna have to deal with this immature knuckle head. Should have to worry about this? Or preemptively call police?  Cool, figured as much. I think he thought id fold and just agree.  Doubtful. Ignore him unless he bothers you again. The police won’t get involved with either of you at this point. He’s just mad that he lost business.  As far as a civil issue goes something I should worry about? Thanks, I figured. Sounded like a scam.  This is a civil issue. The police do not need to involved in this.  Ignore him, if you get a court summons respond to it then. This is a civil matter, there is nothing the police can do either way
