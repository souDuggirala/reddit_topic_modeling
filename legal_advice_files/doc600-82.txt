A recall was just announced on, among others, CVS branded infants ibuprofen. The expiration dates of the affected product are listed, and we are checking the lot numbers to verify. 

If it turns out he was dosed with the now recalled product (in home, by us), what is the proper way to document this, and how should we do so if he does not show immediate health affects from it? 

Thanks.  According to the company that recalled the ibuprofen,

&gt;"There is a remote possibility that infants, who may be more susceptible to a higher potency level of drug, and therefore may be more vulnerable to permanent NSAID-associated renal injury"

This may sound serious... But!

&gt;"To  date, there has not been any received reports of adverse events related to the product that is the subject of this recall"

And 

&gt;"Adverse effects that may be experienced are nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain or, more rarely, diarrhea. Tinnitus, headache and gastrointestinal bleeding are also possible adverse effects."


It was not clear from the public statement exactly how or when Tris Pharma discovered the problem, or why it came about. 


I would schedule a go to a doctor and get your infant checked out and examined just to make sure nothing is abnormal. If there are any side effects that have immediate concern/risk, go to your nearest children's hospital.


You don't need to report or document anything, just moniter your infant with an extra eye. Hope the best!  Why don't you just cross that bridge when you come to it? Your son is fine now, correct?
