So, I bought a condo. At the time I purchased it, the sale was dependent on the previous owner replacing the old hot water heater. They did. 

After I moved in, I started having trouble with the hot water heater. It stopped working several times and I called various people to fix it. Two years later I find out they installed the wrong type and size of heater and I need to replace it. 

Am I just out of luck here? It feels like I got cheated. I'm no expert in hot water heaters and had no way of knowing it was wrong.

Every time I try to Google anything about what options I have I just get links to places trying to sell me hot water heaters (I guess I don't know the right words to google) and could use a fresh view on what to do. Is there any legal standing to request a new ('correct') hot water heater from the person I bought this place from/the company that installed an incorrect hot water heater or am I stuck footing the bill? 

Thanks!
  [deleted] You could talk to a real estate lawyer about this to determine if there's any liability on the previous owner or the previous installer.  However, in the long run, pursuing this would probably be more expensive than just having a new water heater installed. Honestly you're stuck with it. You'd have to prove they knowingly installed the wrong one and probably have to explain why you didn't verify the type of install at the time of purchase (a post install inspection of the hot water heater for example).
