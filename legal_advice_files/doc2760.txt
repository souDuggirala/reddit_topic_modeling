 I’m the principle songwriter/musician in a musical project called Windup Fox (http://scotmccormack.net/windupfox) and noticed this afternoon that someone as of February 2019, had signed up for Twitter using The Windup Fox to sell pocket watches on Twitter and Patreon () I have documented proof through website registration (up until recently http://windupfox.net) was registered, and I also owned a short lived clothing company and design firm called WndupFx. I’ve been using this monicker for close to 15 years, so I don’t want to just ‘give it up.’ Curious what my legal recourse is here. He/she has a patreon page and is accepting donations (I’m assuming to sell or repair watches.) It’s not entirely clear what the purpose is. I'm not a lawyer, and am less familiar with Canadian IP law, but if you haven't taken steps to protect the name as a trademark, then you probably don't have a legal leg to stand on. Registering a domain name doesn't give you any particular intellectual property protections.  It's possible for you to have one trademark for music and entertainment purposes, and someone else to have a nearly identical word or combination of words as a trademark for a watch-making business. You can consult with a intellectual property attorney who can give you specific advice, but just having the same name, even if you had it first, may not give you any recourse here.  You'd have to sue them if they're infringing on your IP They're not selling pocket watches though
