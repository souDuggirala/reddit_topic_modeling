 The Netherlands, Europe // 16yrs old. My mom signed me up for this after school tutoring and homework support, I do not enjoy it at all. The "vibe" there is not relaxed and it feels like such a commitment, I have to go there everyday and no exceptions, only when I got other appointments / am sick. (which I fake alot). I initially got signed up because I've been slacking on my school work for a little while but I really want to pick it up on my own because I can easily do that. So I was wondering if I can 'legally' stop myself from having to go there. Sorry if there were grammar/spelling mistakes English isn't my native language.  So thats not good advice. Thats just something people say in the US(not sure about other places) "If the teacher doesn't show up in 15 min then we can legally leave class" Thats unfortunate! Thanks for the swift reply. The only way to legally get out of it is if the tutor is 15 minutes late.
