 I'm starting a business that sells subscriptions to be able to watch gaming content from big name players and we obviously need to be able to advertise what games we make content for. Is it a no-go to just use the actual games' logos on our website or is that considered fair use? I would assume that we can just type the name or make our own stylized picture showing what games we have, but it would be nice to just be able to use the games' logos if it won't draw the ire of their legal teams.
