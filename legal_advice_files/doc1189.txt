 I'm in phx arizona my friend got arrested a few days ago. His bond is $50 cash bond. I'm not going threw a bond place just a money order. What happens if he don't show up for court? Does he gotta stay with me? Will I get into trouble if he don't show up for court dates?  If he doesn't show up, you will lose your $50. You won't get in trouble. The court will set requirements for his bond as far as whether there are limitations on where he must live. The court can set a requirement that he live with you, but only if you agree to it. The court cannot force you to let him live with you.  If you’re paying to bail him out, he owes you the courtesy of showing up for his court date. And he needs a lawyer/public defender if he can’t afford one
