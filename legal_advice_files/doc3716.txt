 My apartment building uses luxar one system to manage large packages that come in. I got something in the mail yesterday and went today to pick it up. They had already returned it to sender because they have a 24 hour hold policy on packages. I was not home yesterday and couldn’t get the package. Is this allowed? I feel like my mail is being withheld from me. Do I have to notify office staff every time I won’t be home for a night? I paid for express shipping because I needed this to come in on time and it has been returned before I could even go and get it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  What specifically does your lease say about package holding? Your lease matters here. They don't have to provide a service not in your lease. Yes it does. There’s no way for the mailmen to come inside the building I am in. They only have access to the mailboxes outside and the office building. When I first moved here 2 years ago we had a week to pick up packages and it’s slowly been getting shorter and shorter and now I haven’t been able to get any of my packages in time.  Does your lease say they provide a package holding service? It's a PITA for them to deal with packages especially around the holidays.
