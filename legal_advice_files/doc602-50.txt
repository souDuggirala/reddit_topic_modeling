So I am buying a house and and currently have 7 months left on my lease. I’m pretty sure I was told that if I cut the lease I would have to pay monthly until someone moved in. Now I’m told I have to pay the remainder. I don’t have the money for this on top of buying a house. It does not talk about cutting of a lease in the lease document.
