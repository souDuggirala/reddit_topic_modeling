 Recently my roommates rent check bounced because we hadn't moved all of the money into his account in time. We then got the following email from our landlord: "Hello, Your check of 1/30/19 was returned finally on 2/4/19 due to insufficient funds. My account has been charged $15 as a result which is now your cost. Additionally, you have a late rent fee as well as fee for returned check that are do immediately along with your January rent. Please re-deposit your rent and make sure you have sufficient funds in your acct. before you do this. I could take out all the fees from your security deposit, if you prefer. Please pay full attention to the terms of the lease... - $100 for returned check per person. - $50 for late payment per person. - $15 to cover the bank fee. - total: $615 currently due plus rent for February. I could use discretion and only charge you $165 in total. However if it should happen again, I will follow the terms of the lease, very exactly" I did some research on Mass tenants rights and it seems like landlords cannot charge late fees until the rent is over 30 days late, also the largest fee for a returned check is $30. Our lease does have those rules but my landlord cant enforce them because they aren't legal right? thanks so much.  If this source is legit it seems like a landlord cant enforce illegal terms. Not right. Imo you sign away tenants rights when you sign a lease. Reason being that you had the opportunity to say you didn't want to sign and all the fees are probably detailed in your lease.
