 Background: I'm 16, I live in Alberta, Canada, I work at Booster Juice My boss has booked me multiple times for a closing shift which runs until 10:15pm. In Alberta, Child Labor Laws say that anyone between the age of 15 and 17 cannot work past 9pm without someone over the age of 18 supervising them. I work alone for the majority of my shift including until 10:15pm. What can I do about it other than tell my boss to not book me past 9pm? If I tell him I cant close he'll start cutting back my shifts, he hasn't said that but he's started to do it and give me little to no hours per week. Thank for any help. I am in Alberta and started working at 15 and had a few jobs where I was left alone past 10pm. In fact I even worked at Booster Juice one summer but I was 18 then. I was never bothered to be alone and was fine with it but if you are uncomfortable I think the first step would be to just bring it up with your manager. It sucks but either you keep working those hours by yourself or they will probably change your schedule and let someone else work those hours who can work alone. You can also report them.  IANAL - You can contact Alberta Employment Standards and make a complaint, but your boss getting in trouble from the labour board is not going to make him happy to have you on staff. Your boss can't fix the situation if he isn't aware (and he might not be) of the law. Let your boss know that you cannot legally work past 9pm without an adult. Since your availability will now be limited, chances are that yes, you may find yourself scheduled for fewer hours. Alternately you can contact head office and explain the situation, and let them speak to your boss... but regardless, your boss will end up in a conversation about your hours whether you, the labour board, or the company brings it up. You probably should not continue working alone, as the law is there for your own protection.
