 I made a website that utilises a job board's public API to find out the upper salary range. The API works by submitting multiple calls (around 10-20) until it returns an empty response. This is all done via AWS Lambda. I am not storing any data at all nor monetising it. This method can also be performed using the site's own search tool. Could this get me into any legal troubles? New Zealand here however the site is Australia based.  From a legal perspective, you can't be sure you have permission to use the API this way or not. The lack of authentication is not an invitation. I'd be looking at the site's overall TOS/AUP/EULA for guidance. Failing that, email them and ask. My site has a search box, and the API is only queried upon the user makes the search - so it depends on the traffic to my site. At the moment probably 100 users per day (not many!). I'll see if I can locate the license agreement.  So long as it doesn't violate any license agreement, you're good. If you have difficulty locating the terms of service, you could email the company to find out How frequently are you hitting their site for how much data is usually the main factor Sorry I'll rephrase that. The API does not require authentication.  What leads you to believe that the API is public? The document spelling that out should also have spelled out acceptable use of the API.
