 I am an EU student at a UK university, originally from Spain. I've been asking my father to visit me for some months now, but he has always refused. He recently admitted to me that this is because he was at the UK 10 years ago and, when issued a hefty fine for parking offences, he left the country instead of paying them so he is scared that he may be prosecuted or stopped at the airport. Does anybody here know if the statute of limitations applies or if he could still be held liable for this? Try r/legaladviceUK
