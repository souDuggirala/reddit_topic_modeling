 A couple of months ago, I got a ticket for "improper or unauthorized use of lights" because I had underglow on my car, and it was a 2 point offense. When I went to court to try to get rid of the points, the prosecutor told me to take the BDIC and if I did, my ticket would be changed to "impeding traffic" which is a pointless offense. I did so, and I paid my fine. Last month however, I got a speeding ticket. I went and paid it because due to the circumstances there was no chance I could get it reduced. It was a couple hundred bucks, and it was supposed to be a 3 point ticket. However, I recently got a letter in the mail saying that I can take the BDIC by a certain date and the points will not be disclosed to insurance companies. It says clearly that based on my driving record, I am eligible to take the course. However, it also clearly states that "you may avoid having a violation disclosed to insurance companies under this program only once." Considering that the first time I took the course was court mandated and was to change my violation rather than hide it, would I still be eligible. I tried calling the number on the letter but they could not help me. Thanks.
