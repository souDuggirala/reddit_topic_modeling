 Tire shop replaced damaged tire, scratched rim near the hub cap when taking the hub cap off to balance it. (Must have used a screwdriver (wtf.)) Noticed after I got home. I do have a picture of the rim from the day before when I was taking a picture of the damaged tire. They definitely caused this. Im going to go show them Monday, is there anything I can do if they say that they canâ€™t do anything?  You could try suing them for the cost to repair the scratches, you'd just have to convince a judge that the shop definitely caused them. Your pictures would likely help a lot but it's not necessarily a 100% sure thing. Be civil when you go to the shop on Monday and don't immediately start threatening lawsuits.
