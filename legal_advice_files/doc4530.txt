 Got an out of state parking ticket in SLC, Im a few states away. The vehicle was registered under a business name and likely wont be going back to Utah ever again. I'm the business owner however and will be returning to Utah at some point If it's a valid ticket, you must pay it. Of course.  Yes. "I don't want to" is not a legal reason to avoid paying a ticket.
