 I'm not sure what to do. I'll try to keep it short: A close friend of mine who's an underage girl was being requested by supposedly a "16 Year old handsome Brazilian Guy" that was &lt; asking for full body pale aesthethics for no apparent reason. He sent my friend a link with a pale female which age I can't tell, that was literally posing and dressing almost naked "sexy" pictures. After being rejected he kept insisting and starting to tell my friend she's beautiful and trying to make her take pictures and ended up sending a picture of him on underwear, no face included and then telling her "Can I see you now?" and smiling, my friend was asking me if she should block him, which I responded saying that I don't have anything to do with that. Here's his profile link on Instagram: After going more deep into who is this guy in the first place I found out he's following literally 400 girls and just has 100 followers, where I'm completely sure my friend is not the only one that has been at least harassed this way or worse. All I'm asking for is from you reddit community is to help me to stop him and do whatever is necessary to stop him from sexually harassing other people. I'm not even sure if it's really him the one in the pictures but whoever it is needs to be busted because requesting for underage Sexual material is illegal and I don't personally doubt he has already fished someone or more already. I have proof of all the screenshots of the conversation, I just don't know how to post them. I'm sorry if this isn't the correct place for this, but I honestly don't have knowledge of where to complaint this, Please spread this out.  [removed]
