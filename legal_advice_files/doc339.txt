 Alright, so our neighbor has a car that they park in the street. Their car alarm goes off about every 15 minutes. I've spoken with other neighbors who are all fed up as well. The neighbor who owns the car has been informed and refuses to do anything about it. I know we probably need to talk to a lawyer, but I wanted to know if their is anything the authorities can do or if there is a way to get it towed legally, or really what remedies are available. It's becoming quite the nuisance. I had a neighbor whose car alarm went off for 3 days straight when they were out of town. It was a nightmare. So sorry you have to deal with this. Try the non-emergency police line. I've never ever heard of someone suing another party for their alarm going off. That's all I can say.  Fair enough, even if it's becoming a public nuisance? Is there no civil remedy? You can't sue him successfully for a car alarm going off.  Well, I dont want to if I can avoid it, but will if it comes to it I guess What is a lawyer going to do if you hire one? Do you plan on suing your neighbor?  I meant the cops. We have talked to them. Other neighbors have talked to them. They have been talked to, but they still refuse to fix it.  Why havenâ€™t you gone out to talk to them?  We've been calling the cops, who have driven by but haven't actually spoke with us yet. We will keep calling them so that a record exists, but they haven't done much for us yet.  You can call and make a noise complaint every time it goes off. The cops are not going to be thrilled being called every 15 minutes because some jackass refuses to address his car alarm. I would make a game about getting it to go off even more. Pester the asshole until he gets the alarm removed.
