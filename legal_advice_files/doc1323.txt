 Hello, I am writing in our final attempts to save our home. My parents have been fighting to keep their home over the last year. We worked with a "'debt / foreclosure specialist" and lawyer. Yet after filing for bankruptcy and several failed attempts at a Loan modification, our home was finally sold on January 10th 2019 on Sheriff's sale. We recently received a letter from ReMax stating the property was purchased by 'Dakota Asset Management' and requested information in terms of relocation. At this stage, I wanted to know if we had any remaining options or Rights to explore in order to keep our home. My sibling and I are both prepared to assist financially to help them at any extent - including attempting to buy the property or moving back home to assist them with the mortgage if they have the option to buy it back from the new mortgage company. Thanks for your time, and we appreciate any advice at this point.  Thank you very much, we are going to take a step back and consider this option. Thank you Thank you very much, very true we are speaking with a mortgage broker tomorrow to explore.  Thank you The only option would be for someone capable of getting a mortgage to offer to purchase the home with a new mortgage. The new owner doesn't have to even entertain the offer let alone accept it. If it's foreclosed then it surely is saleable to anyone, right? So couldn't the OP make an offer to buy (if eligible for the mortgage)? No, your options are exhausted. The house was sold, itâ€™s not yours anymore.
