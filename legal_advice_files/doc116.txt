 I was going over the speed limit about ~20mph (I know this is bad, but I know the road fairly well and it was empty. Not an excuse thought, I know) It was my first time being pulled over, and I was given a traffic summons. However, I will be out of the country for several months and unable to make the court date. Should I/ Can i get this moved to January, or is that too far? How much of a fine should I expect? What exactly goes down during a court summons/ a trip to the TVB? They closed the last TVB in Suffolk years ago. Both Nassau and Suffolk use regular District Courts now which means show up with a lawyer and youâ€™re likely to get offered a decent plea bargain.
