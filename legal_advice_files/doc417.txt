 Hello, I live in Texas. I have lived in my apartment for 6 years, and my current lease doesn't end until December 2019. My complex is having issues with the hot water - boiler problems, valves, water mane bursts, etc. They have been working diligently to fix the issue but this is day #11 that we haven't had any hot water. This is huge sanitation issue not to mention it's winter and I can't take a hot shower. I can't take a shower at all. Bathing in a bowl of water i microwaved is not why I pay $1,100/month for a 1 bedroom apartment. My question is - do i have legal grounds to break my lease (with no fees) due to no hot water for 11 days? Even though they are working on it? I associate any info. Thanks!
