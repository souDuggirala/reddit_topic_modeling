 Not sure if I used the right flair, so here’s the story. My mom is a mail carrier in IL and she told me this story. Someone who she works with was delivering mail and was attacked by a junkie and he had such bad wounds that he had to go to the hospital, however he got sent all of the hospital bills and he contacted the department of labor to pay the bills because it happened on the job and the DOL told him to get a lawyer and go after the guy who attacked him to get them paid. Can he go after the department of labor for this because they’re not helping him with the medical bills? Assuming he's part of NALC, he should get them involved if they aren't already
