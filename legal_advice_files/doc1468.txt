 Hey all, Im not very good at talking about my problems, so here is my best shot. In August of 2018, I realized that, after 1 year of employment with a company based in Florida, I was never informed of our PTO sick leave policy. After a back and forth email string with my manager, I was given a screenshot of the employee handbook that contained the PTO policy that contained information that was not the same as the required posters, nor how to use it. In December, I gave two days notice that I would be taking a sick day, and was ordered by my manager to get a doctors note and find a shift coverage. I was unsuccessful in getting someone to cover the shift, but I was successful in getting a legitimate Doctor’s note (both I know are things the manager can’t ask for, but I figured I would do it to avoid any problems getting the PTO). After I relay all of this to my boss, the night of my missed shift I get an email denying my PTO, saying that only FT employees can get PTO, and that since I sent the Dr note after 5 pm my case would be sent to HR to determine if I would be terminated. What are my options? I feel like reporting this as well as other infractions to the CA dept of Industrial Relations is in order so they can take care of it and get me my money, but is there other things I should consider before moving forward? Please let me know your opinions, or if additional info is needed! [removed] Yes! Do you with in CA?
