 What: Private party 2 year lease, do have written lease. Backstory: December I received a notice from mortgage company that mortgage was 90 days past due. Landlord claimed to correct issue. Received letter three weeks ago, from an office representing HUD, stating we had to apply to stay in the home once mortgage company gives it back to them in 60-90 days. Contacted landlord, he stated bank wouldn’t work with him and told me to file the application with HUD so we wouldn’t have to move. I have not as yet, but I will send the application. I do know that the Protection for Tenants at Foreclosure Act 2018 gives us time so long as the new owner doesn’t wish to live in the property. Received a letter on Friday stating the foreclosure auction is set for X date at X time. Which is in 4 weeks. I have paid rent on time (actually early) in the exact same way for 16 months. I have proof or each payment. Landlord stopped paying the mortgage around July/August last year. Issue: There are two rent payments between now and the auction. Do I still pay the landlord or do I pay the bank?  Thank you, I will call them tomorrow and hopefully they will know. Banks do not typically take title before the public sale. If there are no buyers who make the minimum bid, then the bank takes title If the bank has set an auction date then the bank now owns the house. I would ask the bank where to send their rent.
