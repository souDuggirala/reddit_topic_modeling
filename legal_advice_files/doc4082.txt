 Like yesterday he threatened to "beat the shit out of me". He's 21 and I'm 19, and he's been staying here lately because his car is broken and he needs my parents help so he's not at his trailer where he belongs. I don't think he could be arrested and pressing charges might not even do anything (he's broke I doubt what he did is that illegal)but I want him to stop fucking talking to me period. He lives in the room right next to mine and literally is incapable of reason. When I have friends over he doesn't care, he comes in and screams at me anyways. Like I don't think being a generally objective piece of useless human garbage is illegal but I wish it was grounds for getting him the fuck out of my face.  Your poor parents. Two adult children living in their house who are still fighting like children.  You’re both adults. Grow up and find your own place to live if you don’t like it. You can move. That is your option You are correct that people yelling and saying not nice things to you isn't illegal.
