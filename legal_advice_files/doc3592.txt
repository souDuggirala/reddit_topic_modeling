 I’m in Maine but this is for all of the USA. Today bump stocks got banned. Right now there is no buyback, or compensation in any form. There’s also no grandfather clause. Reports say all stocks need to be destroyed or turned into the ATF. All my stocks got destroyed in a tragic boating accident. Isn’t it illegal for the government to ban or take back anything without compensation? Some of these stocks exist in a digital STL format. Does that make the STL file illegal too? Said the guy who just got banned by a cop. 1. This is not a megathread. 2. I'm sure your stocks are hidden somewhere. No one will believe the boat story. 3. The government can ban things without compensation. 4. I doubt a ban on the STL files would hold up, but unless a court rules it's unconstitutional you'd have to read the text of the ban to see if they are included. It's not illegal for them to ban something without compensation, but it doesn't seem that there's provisions to compensate people for their existing private property. I wouldn't be surprised to find this challenged on that basis.
