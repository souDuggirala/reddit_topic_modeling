My wife and I got married in Houston, Texas recently and to make a long story short, the DJ screwed everything up and ruined our party, we are ready to sue, if possible.

The company we hired was paid for 6 hours and they are offering a refund for 2 out of the 6 hours we paid them for. We feel like the least they can do is offer a full refund, which we asked for, and they declined.

The DJ didn't play any music for the first 3 hours and about half of our guests left by the time the back up DJ came to the rescue. The party was dead, my wife was crying. This was a wedding disaster. All the time and money we spent to have this nice party for 150 guests was ruined. We will never get this night back.

The DJ company is blaming power problems, which the church has emailed me stating there were none. I believe the church because everything was working fine and the back up DJ used the same outlet as the first DJ.

Do we have legal standing? Can we sue? If we sue, what are our chances of winning?

This is emotionally draining, we are boiling with anger. Any help is MUCH appreciated. Thank you. Why was the first DJ not playing any music? What was he or she doing during those 3 hours? It seems like they would know ASAP (like during their setup) if they were having power problems - not 3 hours later. Who called the back up DJ?  small claims court Yes, your recourse is to sue the DJ company for the amount of money you feel you're entitled to, as they allegedly did not provide the services you agreed to and paid for.
