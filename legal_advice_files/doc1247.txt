 So as the title says, I believe my wife is being forced to work in unsafe work conditions. I apologize for formatting, and general poor writing skills. This is in California. My wife and I both work for a very popular warehouse store. I work outside in the lot, and my wife works in the food court. They have a giant pizza oven with an equally giant vent above it. For the past month the vent hasn’t been working properly and the manager has been notified of this several times. Then four days ago it stopped working completely. So at this point they finally call the technician to come out and repair it the following day but needed to order parts. They came back the next to make the repair. It ended up working for two hours and then back to no operational. They are scheduled to come back to fix it tomorrow but they have remained open and fully staffed the whole time. My wife complained to the manager of burning eyes from the fumes yesterday along with her concerns for safety. Today her and several other employees started getting headaches during work. They kept complaining to the manager since this is a sign of carbon monoxide poisoning. But the manager spoke to a higher up and he said “you can’t get carbon monoxide poisoning from the oven”, which is the opposite of everything I’ve read about this situation. So I guess my question is what can she do here to remove herself from this unsafe environment that won’t jeopardize her job? It’s a gas oven. That’s the extent of my knowledge about it. She can quit or report her suspicions to CALOSHA. The truth of the carbon monoxide likely depends on the type of oven. In any event your wife need not know whether the situation is dangerous or not to involve OSHA or the state. She can call in her concern.
