I am in California

I am Cambodian and was born on the border of Thailand and Cambodia in a refugee camp. My permanent residence card stated place of birth as Thailand. 

For some reason when I applied for my citizenship and filled out the paper work, under country of former nationality I put Cambodia thinking that it is my nationality (now realizing I thought of it as ethnicity). 

Now I want to apply for a passport and am worried that the conflicting information won’t get me approved. I’ve tried researching options and it isn’t clear if I have a case that could be solved by trying to amend my certificate using N-565 form.

How should I proceed?  [deleted] You can also ask in /r/USCIS, /r/askimmigration, and /r/immigration.
