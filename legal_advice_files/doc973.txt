 As succinct as possible: my brother and I rented an apartment for 2.5 years. Our lease ended April 30, 2018. I got a call today (Jan 28, 2019) looking for my brother saying he owed on the apartment and if he didn't pay it would be going to collections(even though we were both on the lease, there's no mention of me anywhere). He didn't forward his address because he was going to be moving around a couple times in a short amount of time. I did forward my address. The landlord also had both of our phone numbers and emails on file. This is the first we are hearing of any charges despite the landlords being required to get us an itemized list within 30 days. I'm not denying the charges due, but it is a large amount to spring with no notice. We feel they didn't make an attempt to contact us but we could be 100% wrong. Do we have any recourse?
