 My friend's ex boyfriend has nudes of multiple past girlfriends on his ipad. Basically, he tried to cheat on his current girlfriend and the girl he tried to cheat with exposed him to her. As revenge, he is selling her nudes and videos of her for money. My friend was 15 at the time she sent him these images and they are in his possession on this ipad. She is worried that by going to the police to inform them of his actions, she could possibly be charged or get in trouble for sending nudes of herself as a minor. Is this true? Are there any other legal implications? She should call the police, there's a pretty good chance this guy could end up in jail for this. She should not be worried, while there is theoretically a law against sharing pictures of yourself underage, the police don't enforce it because they know it would be struck down by the courts. Thanks, I replied before I saw the location edit. This is happening in Canada, she should not be worried about this. No she's 19 now , the pictures are from when they were together Maybe, since she created child porn by taking pictures of herself and sending them to him. OTOH he's distributing and selling, which may be of more interest to the authorities. Your friend should consult with a defense attorney before going to the authorities.
