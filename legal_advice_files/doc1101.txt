 In November, my ex-wife and I's divorce was final. We had decided a few months prior that things just weren't working out and decided on a nice and easy split. No messy lawyers, just split the savings (we didn't own a house or anything), each took an animal, split up furniture, all that jazz. However, before the divorce was final - she was acting very strange and I ended up finding out she was having an affair for almost a year with a family friend by looking at her phone. I immediately reacted by (stupidly) punching a picture frame and the wall causing my hand to be fractured and cut severely. After I got back from the hospital that night I told her I wanted her out of the apartment the next day. Fast forward to the first night she was out of the house... I was/still do suffer from major depression and decided that was enough - and tried to commit suicide. At that time I was transitioning into a new position and did not have health insurance. I am now facing 10k+ in medical bills. I know that my actions are not directly related to her - but is it possible to sue someone over divorcing under false pretenses and possibly sue for the medical bills? Obviously if I had known she was having an affair, the divorce would not have been so friendly. I know it might seem spiteful to do such a thing, but for me it's more the crushing pressure of medical bills and trying to survive pay check to pay check. TL;DR Ex-wife didn't disclose she wanted a divorce, broke my hand and tried to commit suicide. Now I am in tons of medical debt, can I sue her for medical bills/false divorce pretenses? Dude.... no....  You want to sue her because you lost your temper and injured yourself and that is somehow her fault? No. Then you should thank her for not telling you because an uncontested divorce will cost you a lot less than you dragging the divorce out longer out of spite.  No, you cannot sue her because you punched a wall and tried to commit suicide.
