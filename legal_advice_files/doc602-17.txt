I live in North louisiana and was working as industrial maintenance. I had a heart transplant in 2012 and my job suspended me for having too many absentee points. I have frequent doctor visits and I make sure I turn in all of my excuses into HR. Today I was told that I've reached a limit for termination. I've found out recently that even with my condition and excuses they still count the points as going against me. Ive talked with the HR supervisor and she said that as far as she knows there is no extenuating circumstances in the policy. I need my health insurance or I cant afford my medical situation. Any clarity will go a faq what. Thanks in advance Thanks If your employer has 50 or more employees at that location (or near it) they are required to follow FMLA laws. That would allow you protected time off to handle medical issues. 

If they do not, you may still be protected under ADA.  Missing time for doctors appointments should be considered a reasonable accommodation. You can make a report to EEOC regarding this to see if they can follow up for you. 

Side note: This mostly goes out the window if you didn't make them aware of appointments or if you no call no showed.  I have been working there a year at November 16 and the point total is 9 1/2 How long have you worked there and how much time did you miss?
