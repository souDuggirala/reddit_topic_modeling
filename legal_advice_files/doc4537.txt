 The father of my kids got charged with Aggravated Sexual Assault. It took place in a bar. Sept 10th. The bartender was the one to accuse him. She filed the order October 1st. She stated that they danced, and that he touched her inappropriately, so she “pushed him out, and locked the door” then after decided to do a welfare check to see if he was okay....? But then stated he tried to touch her again. It is said that there is a video of him in the bar, and dancing with her. But they won’t show me the rest of it, where she allegedly pushes him out and locks the door. The way that specific bar is set up, it should’ve been shown in the video where that happens. But doesn’t. And ignore when i have asked to show that part of the video.  Not sure what you are asking. They have no obligation to show you the video.
