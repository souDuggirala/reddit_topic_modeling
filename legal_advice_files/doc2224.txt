 I live in an apartment in MI and smoking cigarettes in the building is prohibited. That also means smoking marijuana inside is banned. However, smoking cigarettes on the balcony is fine. Does that mean smoking marijuana on the balcony is fine also? I read the article in the free press and from my understanding you can not smoke on your porch if other people can see or smell it Ehhhhhhh well is anyone patrolling your buildings rooms to see if you’re vaping? Mine doesn’t allow vaping either. But in all seriousness if you want to play it safe just ask your landlord  Its actually not even legal to vape in my building. In any capacity. I’d talk to the landlord and possibly the non emergency line to be extra safe. If I’m being very honest though, if you get a vape it’ll be very hard to detect and you’ll be fine. From what I've read it can't done somewhere like a Porch, since thats semi public. My balcony is very visible to the public. But it is very private meaning no public has access to it. Depends, is public marijuana use legal, or does it have to be privately?
