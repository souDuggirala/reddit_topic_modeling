 A public school near me brings a pastor in before football games, basketball games, soccer games, etc. A prayer, always done by a christian pastor (usually a southern baptist to be specific), is done over the intercom, thus forcing everyone to participate. The prayer is also very obviously a christian prayer (specifically mentions God and Jesus many times). I’m well aware this violates the first amendment, but I’m unsure on what steps to take in putting an end to this. A side note, the school also has a moment of silence everyday. I’ve heard before that this actually violates the first amendment as it can be considered a form of prayer. Is this true, and can this be another violation of establishing a religion?  Also contact Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. This is what they do. The prayer is unconstitutional, I don't believe the moment of silence would be, however. Just your standard after the pledge moment of silence  Thank you! I will definitely look into it.  I am very involved in the school. However, I don’t have the resources to actually sue.  If the public school is just near you, and you don’t go there or participate in those activities, then there is not much you can do legally because you don’t have standing to sue. You could try to encourage someone more directly affected. As for the moment of silence, it’s likely allowed if it’s neutral. If you can point to concrete evidence of religious/ spiritual undertones, then it might violate the establishment clause. However, this issue is far from resolved. Also, you will have the same standing issue described above.  What is the moment of silence for?
