 I apologize if this is the incorrect sub to post on. I figured a lawyer would know. I'll try to explain this and keep it as short as possible... My family and I recently found out that my grandfather, who for my whole life I knew as a baptist minster and great man, murdered a young boy for no reason at all. It's a pretty sickening and shocking story. A relative and I are trying to put a documentary together and would like to attempt to obtain the crime scene photos. Is this possible? Thanks for any advice. [removed] A good library would have microfiches of at least the New York Times. You might find something there. They might be microfiched Unless somebody else has them, and you can find that person, it's very unlikely they're going to be available. Criminal case files just aren't kept for 70+ years. Try some newspaper ads in the location in question. Call around to your City hall and possibly your local police station. I doubt they keep records from that long though unfortunately.
