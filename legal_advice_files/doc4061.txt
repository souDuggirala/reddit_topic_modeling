 I did some work for somebody (1099 work, not W-2 work) that involved me managing a few people whose job it was to makes sales on the street. My employer gave me some cash to pay them, and said I could pay them a bonus of $50 for every 15 sales they made. On a few occasions, I paid them the bonus via CashApp (so out of my own personal bank account) because I didn't have the cash on hand at the moment, and just reimbursed myself with the cash. I didn't tell the employer I did that, but he didn't tell me I could do that either. Since then, we have parted ways. Am I ok?
