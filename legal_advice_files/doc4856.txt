 So my wife was injured at work in May. She is a nurse at a private hospital. She had a fall (tripped over) and long story short has lost some use of her arm (extension to 120 degrees and flexion to 30 degrees). Her good arm can overextend and can bend completely. She has been to an independent assessment and we expect to receive a payout offer from workcover in the next week or 2. Apparently we will have 20 days to either accept the offer or ask for a review or take them to court. Assuming we know practically nothing of the legal system, anyone have any advice? Thanks for reading  There are many large firms that deal with workcover claims and appeals. Give a few of them a call.
