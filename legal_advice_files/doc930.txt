 I am 16 years of age living in Georgia. I live in a neglecting home with only my cancer patient father. I want to run away to Texas to be with a family (not related) that will take better care of me so I can clear up my mind before I break. My mother and father are separated but are not legally divorced. My grandmother, who is against all of it, has all the rights of my father due to his condition. But am I legally allowed to run away with my mothers permission as long as she still has rights to me? Then you can live anywhere that she permits you to live. I believe my mother has primary custody of me If you're doing it legally, it's not "running away" it's "moving." Who has primary physical and legal custody of you?
