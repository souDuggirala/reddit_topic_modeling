 One of the gift cards had $10 on it. The other two had $80 each. Thatâ€™s a total of $170. I have no idea why all three cards were in the same spot nor why they were in the middle of the road. I went online and saw that each card was redeemed for $100 dollars and all of the purchases were used for CCbill Activesoft. When I searched up CCbill, I found out that itâ€™s a site thatâ€™s similar to paypal but typically used as a safe alternative to pay for porn sites. Seems a bit fishy but when thereâ€™s $170 bucks laying in the palm of my hand, I donâ€™t know what to do. ðŸ¤” Got it, crystal clear. So long as the main point of your post is the advice and not the "Location is not optional" part. To provide an exaggerated example . Here, some states have "lawful off-duty activities" statutes that may apply, but we need to know where you are first. is good. 't commit a crime. Maybe you'll get the death penalty. Why didn't you notice the several requests for a location, you dumbass. Maybe that's why you broke the law. is obviously not okay.  One of the downsides to using "untraceable, like cash" means of payment is that losing the physical token makes it "unrecoverable and spendable by the next guy, like cash", subject to your local jurisdiction's finders-keepers law which probably wouldn't allow you to up and spend the money on the spot. You probably have some obligation to report the finding of lost property.  Understood, will do. Would it be better to offer whatever general advice is available and say, "but this may vary depending on your location," or would it be better to just refrain from answering at all until OP sees Locationbot's message and updates their post (or doesn't)?  Please don't act like you're LocationBot. We don't need everyone harping on the OP to provide a location. Your location is not optional. In many places, you have a legal obligation to take reasonable steps to locate the rightful owner before claiming them as your own.
