 TLDR: Fired for having a tattoo after being told to take off my long sleeve shirt. I was hired at an airline company based in Minneapolis that operates flights in California. I was getting fitted for my uniform by an employee and I said I did not want to remove my long sleeve shirt, I want my measurements taken with my clothes on. She says that is not possible, I HAVE to get measured while in a company short sleeve shirt to get the correct measurements. I put on a short sleeve company shirt and I am fired an hour later because my tattoo was seen by a supervisor in the changing area. (Not that it matters but the tattoo is a stack of books above my elbow. I enjoy reading.) I am now on a flight leaving Minneapolis Minnesota to go back to Los Angeles, California. Is it worth it to get a lawyer involved? It was only two days that I worked for the company but I had to travel across the country, they messed up my flight FOUR times, and now I’m unemployed after being forced by an employee to remove my clothes and put on their short sleeve shirt. I also declined 1 other job offer to take this job. And was unable to accept freelance work totaling in $500 due to my time away from Los Angeles. Do I have a case or just bad luck? Thanks.  That makes sense. Thank you.  Yes, they said I just have to wear a long sleeve shirt whenever I’m at work. But when I was getting measured for a new uniform, my tattoo was visible. I appreciate your response though. It seems like the consensus is that it would not be smart to sue.  Cut your losses and look for a new job.   Yes, but you would lose. That is not wrongful termination in a legal sense. Were you aware that tattoos were not allowed? You don’t have a case wrongful terminations is for firings contrary to serious public policy like being fired for refusing to commit a crime or attending jury duty not having a tattoo.
