 I (17 M) dated a girl (17 F) for 6 months and we ended it because "It didn't feel the same" . So we split up and a week later she realizes she still loves me, however I have moved on with my life. She texted me constantly but I told her I don't love her anymore, she told me she hasn't eaten in days and feels depressed. This is where her dad got involved, he believes that it is my fault for making her depressed and he said to me he will come over to my house and "you don't hurt my daughter without me hurting you". I live in Australia, is there any way i can get out of this? is it even a legal problem? It's not a legal issue, yet. If he comes to your house, call the police and be prepared to record any interactions. There's certainly a "macho-ism" persona that is still kicking around in some dad's heads, but it's simply not legal for him to "beat you up" for hurting his daughter. If he confronts you, ask him to leave you alone. If he continues, call the police. Do you have this in writing? That's a threat to your safety, if not your life. If you've got that in writing take it to the police pronto. He may just be trying to scare you because he doesn't like seeing his daughter hurt but he's a grown man acting like a school yard bully. Callthe police now and provide print outs of the threat. If an adult threatens you with violence or trespasses on your property threatening violence, you report it to the police.
