 Question: Are the Terms and Conditions on Voucher ambiguous enough or clear enough for me to argue I should still receive compensation from some sort of legal standpoint? Listen IANAL, and that's why I'm posting here. In the same spirit, I'm trying to dispute the Terms and Conditions using whatever basic contract law I remember from school with word ambiguity. Basically I was given a letter that has the following text: [Shitty Airline] Client: At [Shitty Airline], we are committed to meeting your expectations in providing on-time flight service. We can assure you that every effort is made to avoid disruptions to your itinerary; however, there are times when factors outside of our control influence flight schedules. : [Date], 2018 [FLIGHT#] Departure out of Toronto was [time it left] Arrival into [Where I went] was [Time it got there] p.m. local time . Please accept this $75 travel voucher with our compliments. We apologize that you did not receive it upon departure in Toronto. It was our intention to provide it at that time. We thank you for choosing [Shitty Airline], and look forward to welcoming you on board. [Shitty Airline Shitty Airline Partners] I then end up booking flights with this airline round trip and they have a process where I must email my voucher into them with a 4 to 6 week delay before responding. After several calls prior to booking I mention these vouchers and both times (calls recorded) reps had indicated I could apply these vouchers towards the flights. Fast forward over a month later and I receive this response: . The terms and conditions on your voucher state that a Sunwing Travel Voucher may only be applied to the final payment for any [Shitty Airline] or [Shitty Airline 2] holiday package. Therefore, future travel vouchers are not eligible for redemption on hotel or flight only bookings. [Their toll free] [Shitty Airline]! Thanks for my comprehension? What the fuck? Okay whatever. So I check the terms and condition on the voucher/coupon they gave me and it says: This Travel Voucher may be applied to the future payment of future [Shitty Airline] or [Shitty Company] holiday, for which [Shitty Airline] is the carrier. This voucher has no cash value, is nontransferable, non-refundable, and not valid for group bookings and cannot be combined with any other promotional offers. This voucher may be used in conjunction with another [Shitty Airline] travel voucher with a maximum amount of $200.00 per person per booking. Valid for one year from the date of issue, unless noted otherwise on this voucher, and blackout dates may apply. Flight Delay vouchers issued in conjunction with flights leaving Canada may instead be used toward payment of an excursion operated by [Shitty Airline] Experiences in your holiday destination excursion (excluding North America, Europe and Cruise vacations). [Shitty Airline] Experiences will attribute 65% of the voucher value toward and excursion during your holiday, with no cash refund if the value is less than the cost of the excursion. Please contact your [Shitty Airline] representative for details. Please note that lost or stolen vouchers cannot be replaced. To redeem the full value on a future holiday with [Shitty Airline] or [Shitty airline company 2] please submit this voucher at the time of booking. For your convenience we accept the voucher scanned and emailed to [general shitty airline mailbox] or you may fax it to [fax number] or mail the original voucher to the attention of the Accounting Department, [Their address]. What i'm trying to contend is that the first line in the terms in conditions for the compensation voucher doesn't specify "Packages." It uses the lower case word "holiday" which I'm trying to contend to mean travel with them and not "Holiday Packages with All Inclusive travel" which they are outlining. Does this acceptance of the $75 voucher represent any sort of contract? I'm trying to "argue" that there was an Offer ($75 for bad experience and delay), Acceptance (I took it), Consideration ($75 value off next trip), Mutuality of Obligation, etc. TL;DR Airline gave me a $75 voucher for a bad experience. I tried to apply it as per their instructions and they're now saying it's only good for a very specific type of travel (Holiday Packages). Their terms and conditions on said voucher doesn't specifically indicate that. It might imply it, but doesn't specify Packages.
