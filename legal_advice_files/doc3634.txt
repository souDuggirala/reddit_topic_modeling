 The contents of this post are purely hypothetical. Nothing said in this post relates to any real life circumstances, past or present. So let's say there's a big Silicon Valley company called "" is coming up with a new product, and your friend, "Gabriella," works there. That company comes up with new products regularly, so it's no shocker that something new is in the making. But, Gabriella tells you that the new product is going to be a total flop. She tells you that it will lack X, Y, and Z - and that it will have some features that no one will care for. She advises you to quickly sell all your stocks before the release. It was really a casual conversation, and she didn't mean to let it out. She even says afterward: "don't tell anyone I told you that." No one recorded her saying that, by the way. So if she were accused, it's her word against yours. How much trouble can Gabriella get into?
