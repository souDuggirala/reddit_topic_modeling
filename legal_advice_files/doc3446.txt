 So I was approved for 10 weeks of maternity leave four of which were used. I had six weeks left towards the end of my leave I received a letter that because I had not worked in 30 days I was considered no longer employed. Turns out management never entered in my leave. Instead I was never scheduled. What’s my best course or action here. Do I find a lawyer or just cut my lose? Did you submit FMLA certification that covered this absence? [removed] Ok, follow up within the company first. If they don’t correct it then yes, assuming you were on protected FMLA leave, you should contact an attorney. I’ve already contacted corporate and I was told to call payroll. Have you tried calling your boss/HR? Cause before you got nuclear and send them nasty letters from an attorney you should do that.
