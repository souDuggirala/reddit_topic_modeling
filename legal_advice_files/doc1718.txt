 My grandparents would give me bonds (EE's) when I was younger in increments from 200-5000 according to my family members. I'm now 20 and I asked my mom for my bonds only for her to give me the serial, issue dates, and amounts for inconsisent dates and fairly small amounts. I believe my grandparents may have used her social security number and wrote both names, is there anyway for me to figure this out? I'm not at all familiar with all of these but my mom is notoriously manipulative and while I'd like to think I'm overreacting I need ways to get out ahead of this. I'm afraid the money is gone in the wind and there is nothing I can do. My dad checked their joint tax statements and there are bonds there in the "interest" category for 7500 round about which would make sense for the roughly 20000 which we thought was missing but my dad has yet to find.. originally I was looking at interest all wrong but that's all wrong and that's not accounting for the price. Would appreciate any help as this is seriously making me upset and I don't know what the fuck to do.  Appreciate this, thank you. The Treasury Dept has a form you can submit for lost bonds- it may be able to help you to determine if these were cashed or just lost. It is a part form/process and requires notarization. Not quick. We dealt with this with my MIL's estate, she loved her paper bonds.  Updated apologies.
