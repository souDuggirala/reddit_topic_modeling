  Hi my names drew, im 19 and im living with my mom in Missouri. i was out one night with a friend and when i got back home some of my things were gone (game systems, controllers, ext) all things i paid for out of my pocket. i pay her monthly for things such as internet, car insurance , and housing. when i asked her where my stuff was she told me she took them. when i asked for my stuff she refused to return the stuff i paid for to me. is she legally allowed to do this since i live in her home even though i paid for this stuff, or is what she doing technically stealing? if this post isnt allowed, then im sorry.  You're going to pay more in court fees and legal fees. Count you losses and move out.  thank you so much for the help :) hmmm i see. so i risk being evicted though. im getting an apartment in the summer so may not want to risk it now xD. thank you very much :) You can report your mom to the police for theft. Your mom can legally evict you if she wants. If she took your property, then that is theft. You can report her or sue her in small claims for their return or their value.
