  I am extremely upset, today I received an opened envelope in the mail from my Online Bank that had the following information exposed.... 1. Social Security Number 2. Date of Birth 3. Full Bank Account Number I live in the US (California), and spoke to a representative... Apparently this "W-9" form requires that all these fields be exposed.... do I have any recourse? What should I do to proactively protect my identity? Should I file a complaint with the BBB? They have changed my account numbers, but I am still upset because these 2 items are what I use to "verify my identity" when I call them up. You can ask them to change your verification questions.
