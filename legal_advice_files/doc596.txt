 On the school bus I ride, there's usually about 1/4 chance of there not having enough seats, causing kids to have to stand up in the middle of the bus. Today, everyone for my bus load was present, and 3-5 kids had to be in the middle. My father said it was illegal, but I want some clarification. thx Yes, it is illegal. You can try calling the non-emergency police phone number when it is occuring. But you might be better off contacting the principal, school board, superintedent, or the state board (phone#: 225-342-5840).
