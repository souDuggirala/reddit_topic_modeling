 Friend of mine was charged with a MIP, open container, and Fake ID almost two years ago. Court date was pushed back, pretty sure his lawyer had him take pre-trial diversion route rather than use his first offender (not entirely sure). Anyways, he had to serve a year of probation and complete 30 community service hours. It is almost over so my friends and I plan to throw him a party, but he's a little nervous and wanted to make sure he can't be brought in for a urine test or anything after the date of probation ends. He has had little to no contact with PO. The probation officer hasn't even entered his community service hours into the online reporting system, even though they have been done for months. Only time he's done a urine test was when he called to ask the guy a general question. He also transferred to UGA (located in Athens where he was arrested) which his PO doesn't know about (probably not good). my questions are \-Can he be brought in for a drug test even after the end date of probation date? \-Will he possibly get in trouble for not having community service hours logged despite the fact he's provided proof of completion multiple times and gotten no response? \-Is it too late to notify his PO that he moved to Athens? Can he get in trouble because of this? he only has a few days left of probation. Thanks for the help.  He or his lawyer could ask the probation officer or the clerk of the court in which he was sentenced.  How can he know if they have filed a violation petition?  If the maximum expiration date of his probation term passes and the department has not filed a violation petition, he will be in the clear with respect to his current probation sentence. All great questions for his lawyer. Generally speaking, he should have notified his PO immediately when he moved but now he needs to sort it out with his lawyer ASAP.
