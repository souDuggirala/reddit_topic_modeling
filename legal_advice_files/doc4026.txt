 So this is in Niagara Falls Ontario, Canada. We sold a property but still have a business there, and both of us (buyer and seller) agreed to certain terms. The landlord has to pay 25% of the hydro/water costs as the business is a restaurant and uses most of it, however there are apartments on top which are being rented out that use quite a lot of hydro and water, however the landlord refuses to pay, it is in the contract however. As well, we agreed in the contract and paid for a 3 year lease for $800/month on the apartments above the restaurant but the landlord locked us out and is renting it out to some other people for $1200 a month. The landlord is also raising rent for us, even though in the contract it is a fixed rate, fixed term rental. I've talked to my lawyers who did all the paperwork and they said they would gladly help me, but wanted a lot of money. Is there anything I can do to recoupe my money from the 25% hydro thing as well as the apartment rental units? Would it be possible to turn off the power and water for the upstairs apartments because they aren't paying for it, we are? Also, any by-laws regarding loud noises in restaurants that may or may not be late at night (but still during business hours) and early in the morning? Also, can we prohibit the landlord from walking into the restaurant? She just yells at us as loudly as possibly during our busiest times and tells us that we aren't paying enough money to her (everything we pay was written in contracts, reviewed by my lawyers and hers, and she happily agreed when we sold it), should we call the police when she does this? I am definitely getting a lawyer, but it's taking too long, and when she does these stupid things like yelling at us during our busiest hours, throwing out heaps of garbage at our front door (we have cameras), we lose customers.  Okay, thanks. I'm meeting with my attorneys in a couple days, I just don't know what to expect. Commercial leases tend to be beyond the scope of this sub, as the contracts involved are often quite detailed. Commercial tenants do not enjoy the protections of the province's _Residential Tenancies Act_, and the contract often governs as written to the degree both parties are willing to enforce it. (The corresponding [_Commercial Tenancies Act_]() is a much thinner document.) You can - and should - talk to an attorney about pushing back on this. However, you'll also want to plan to move when your lease comes up for renegotiation or renewal, as you can expect these terms to be part of your landlord's offer at that time even if you prevail now. If the cost of an attorney is daunting, then you can try taking your landlord to small claims for the costs you incur due to breach of contract, but expect your landlord to make your life as difficult as possible in the meantime. Do not shut off utilities to the other units. The occupants there aren't party to your dispute, and have a right to habitable homes. That right is enforceable against the landlord, but deliberately interfering with the landlord's ability to satisfy that duty isn't going to go well for you. Whether your landlord may enter the property is largely governed by your lease. If your lease is silent then you can likely ask the police to remove her as an unwelcome guest or trespasser if she enters without good reason, but it won't take much for her to come up with a valid reason. Document any walk-outs and bring that information to your attorney. However, you're also alleging a breach of your rights as a _residential_ tenant with respect to the unit you were locked out of. That may well fall within the Landlord Tenant Board's jurisdiction. If you want to find out, file form [A1](http://www.sjto.gov.on.ca/documents/ltb/Landlord%20Applications%20 %20Instructions/A1.pdf) and [T2](http://www.sjto.gov.on.ca/documents/ltb/Tenant%20Applications%20 %20Instructions/T2.pdf) with the LTB together. You can seek remedies for damages due to the lockout, but I expect the utilities issue will be beyond their scope due to the commercial tenancy.
