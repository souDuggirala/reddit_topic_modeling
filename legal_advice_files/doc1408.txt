 I’m in the state of CA, and back in 2014 I was leaving the gym one night and a guy snuck up and punched me in my face knocking out two of my teeth. I managed to find one and drive to the emergency room where they put it back in. But the other one was gone and it took 8 months to get a new one. Bills ended up costing me over 8 grand. Here’s the thing though, my insurance did cover most of it. I ended up paying only 2500 out of my pocket. BUT, the judge ordered that the guy pay me a little over 9 grand. I ended up having to put a lien on the guy, (spelling?) And to be honest I really don’t know what that was or anything like that. Supposedly if he tries to buy anything or sell anything, it’ll show he has to pay me first. It’s been nearly 5 years and I haven’t seen a dime or heard anything. Is it a lost cause now, And I’ll likely never see the money he owes me that was court ordered? Ah I knew I forgot to mention something. Okay so I tried that already. He was put on a 3 year probation and I had the phone number of his probation officer. She wasn’t any help to me at all. I asked her about this and getting information on where he works or getting his wages garnished, and she said she couldn’t legally give out that information. Bare with me because this was so long ago that it’s kind of a blur now, but I tried finding out all that info on garnishing his stuff and no one seemed to know what to do or who to talk to. It was impossible to find anyone to help me.  You may still have some options: [http://www.courts.ca.gov/1178.htm](http://www.courts.ca.gov/1178.htm) Information about garnishing their wages or bank account toward the bottom of the page.
