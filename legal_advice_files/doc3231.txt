 My brother just went in for an interview for working with children at a hospital. He got the job on the spot from the department. Then the doctor who heads the department said he wouldn't let him work there due to his psoriasis. Is this a discrimination suit or just a shitty thing that happened? One of the three pronged definition of disability includes 'being regarded as having a disability'. Usually a facial scar or prosthetic is the example given, but this sounds, since it's cosmetic based, it could also be covered. []() [=1302 context=edicollect](=1302 context=edicollect) The ADA issue will be more important then. A milder, largely cosmetic case of psoriasis would not meet the definition set by the ADA, and could be legally discriminated against. More severe cases that impact one or more "major life activities" would be disabilities, and could not be legally discriminated against Some states may have broader protections And thank you... Thank you master, I mean bot...enjoy your earth when you take over. It's not affecting his work it's controlled and mostly aesthetic Thank you I I'll pass along I dknt know the exact rationale but it sounded like it may be due to the aesthetics versus infection control as far as I'm aware. But u wasnt in the interview or subsequent phone calls so I'm not entirely sure. My brother isnt the one who told me, I spoke with my father about it. Assuming you're in the US, this could be covered by the ADA protections if his psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis rises to the level of "disability" defined there Would also depend on the rationale of the doctor. Psoriasis itself is not contagious (we had a recent thread about this issue in the workplace), but skin carries a lot of bacteria so it may depend on what reasonable accommodations could be made to protect against transmission, especially if he'd be working with populations at higher risk (immunocompromised, burn victims, etc) [This]() has some good information for your brother.
