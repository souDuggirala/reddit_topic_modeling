 Hello, I'm a Washington employee (or at least I thought I was). I would told I was an employee and to work like one, but the paperwork was delayed. My employer - who had quite a positive reputation in my mind - is now telling me they can no longer treat me as an employee, because it would be to difficult to become established in WA state, and that I should treat everything as an independent contract situation. As far as I can tell, that's not above board. I already signed W-4s; the employment situation was one that was clearly suited for an employee, not an independent contractor. My question though has to do with unpaid wages. I understand from LNI that I can claim unpaid wages through them, even for an out-of-state company. However, in the employment paperwork I signed, there was an employee agreement which included a forced arbitration clause. Would that hinder my ability to file for unpaid wages through the state? From what I've read, that does handle lawsuits, but I can't seem to find whether that applies to action from LNI.
