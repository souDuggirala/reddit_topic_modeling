 I am working at Walmart as a cashier and yesterday someone brought a paint can to buy. The walmart employee that was responsible for pounding the paint can lid in must not have hit it hard enough because it was loose. Neither the customer nor me knew that and the lid popped off as I tilted the can to get the barcode and grey paint poured onto my shirt, shoes, and pants. I have tried to wash the paint off my clothes in shoes and they are permanently stained. The shoes are $60 and the pants are $60 so with the shirt and socks included I’m out about $150 because some idiot didn’t do their job. Do I have a case here to get my money back? I know who pounded the paint can lid but i’m not sure if I have a legal case. [removed] No, try to be more careful next time.  No.
