 I am curious because I don’t believe this would fall under child pornography, as it is not filming anything. However, consent laws and laws regarding sex are very odd and change a lot, so yeah. In my situation, two fourteen year olds. One in Connecticut, USA and the other in Ontario, Canada. Also, throwaway account for obvious reasons If they're transmitting images of themselves naked, even if it's not being recorded, it's still child pornography (dependent on state/provincial/federal laws outlining what qualifies as "child pornography," as federally in the US it requires "lewd and lascivious" display of genitals, so bare breasts are considered child exploitative material but are not technically child pornography) because it's still naked minors. Okay man, thanks a lot It actually has nothing to do with consent and everything to do with child porn laws. This may trigger a child porn issue, do not do it. Okay then, that’s what I thought. Thanks This falls into the category of “if you have to ask you know it’s wrong”.
