 My girlfriend and I were talking about drinking soon and sex was brought up. If we are both intoxicated, is it still legally consensual? Not that either of us would try to accuse the other of rape or anything, just curious about the legality.  Take hypotheticals to /r/legaladviceofftopic.  Being intoxicated, in and of itself, doesn't mean you (or her) cannot consent to sex. Being TOO intoxicated is a different matter. There is no defined line between intoxicated and TOO intoxicated as it differs for each person.
