 Howdy! If there's a better sub for this let me know! When filling out a bill of sale for a motorcycle bought outside of Georgia there's a section to make sure that Georgia gets their chunk of tax. [here!]() As you can see, I paid $300 less than the KBB value, which leads to a taxable amount of negative money. I assume if they're not okay with this they'll just do like 6% of blue book value or something, I just wanna make sure I'm not fucking something up. Cheers. Ahh I see, I was thinking it was the trade in value for what you were purchasing. Thank you! Uh, Line 2 is for your trade-in. Did you trade in a vehicle? If not, that line should be $0. You pay a set rate that is set by the state. Purchase price is not the taxable value.
