 Hey, LA. I’m not sure if this sub is the right place to ask this, but I don’t know where else to ask. I’m supposed to serve for jury duty tomorrow in my small NC town’s courthouse, and I’m trying to find out whether the courthouse is still up and running through the shutdown. I called the phone number that was included on my summons, as indicated I ought to the night before my jury duty to check whether I was still needed, and it played an automated message intended for a jury that was serving just before Christmas, rather than giving me instructions, and from cursory google searches, I can’t find out whether the courts are still running or not. All the info I can find seems to reference past shutdowns, and I can’t tell whether the facts are the same during this one. Should I just go to the court tomorrow regardless to be safe? What should I do? They probably haven't had any jurors in since before Christmas. It's not unusual. Okay, thank you. I wasn’t sure. The outdated message is what’s confusing me here. It was recorded before the shutdown, and I called at the time indicated by my summons.  The federal government shut down does not impact state government. so assuming you weren't called to federal jury duty, you need to be there as scheduled.  If it's a local state courthouse, yes, it's open. State courts have nothing to do with the federal shutdown. You should go to the court because it has absolutely no impact on state courts.
