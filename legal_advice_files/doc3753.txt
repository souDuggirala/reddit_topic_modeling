 I have previously moved out of a flat and it was left in good condition when I did. I have been waiting to get the security deposit back and I have finally got it back. But I feel like I have been completely overcharged. Is there anyway of challenging the amount I have been charged ? I get that it does cost but I truly believe that we have been overcharged. Cheers for any help  Try posting in /r/legaladviceUK for better help with this issue.  I live in England  That's what I am worried about I have a couple if photos but yeah I sort of guess its my fault for not taking photos  Do you have proof of how the flat was when you moved in and when you moved out?
