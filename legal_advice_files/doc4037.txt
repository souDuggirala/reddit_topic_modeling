 I was involved in a vehicle accident recently. The driver of the other vehicle had a seizure and crossed into my lane slamming into the front drivers side of my vehicle. The police report will be out on Monday. I carry comprehensive/ liability Through usaa but no collision. I was given his insurance companys info and it seems to be a low rated, 1 out of 5 stars, type of company with terrible customer satisfaction and filing a claim with them may prove to be a pain in the rear. I also am now out a vehicle and will need to travel back and forth to work. Any recommendations or advice please in proceeding. This was in georgia.  [removed] [deleted] Call USAA now, don't wait for the police report. I've had their insurance for over 30 years, filed several claims, and have always gotten great customer service. They can tell you what they can do under your policy, and what you need to do. Call USAA, report the accident, ask them how to proceed. You may have to file with the other driver's insurance anyway, but it will not hurt to call your insurer first.  Nice - you saved money on your premiums. And because you saved money on the premiums, you will get the joy of dealing with your other driver's insurance company. Frankly, instead of worrying about the quality of their insurance, you should be grateful they had any - do you have uninsured motorist coverage? The insurance company MAY reimburse you some of the car rental costs - file that claim already and ask them about it.
