 So I was hospitalized 5 years ago for psychiatric problems. Now I have owned up that I am bipolar, and now I'm having some issues. We just got our house remodeled, it's not finished yet. They seem to be milking the system. Anyhow, so all my new house keys were found downstairs away from me, and I got suspicious so I started thinking maybe they were trying to get a set of my keys Fast forward a few days later and I remember a set of photos that came out of nowhere, strown all over the ground. Now I'm on full alert, however my family thinks I am going crazy, when I feel pretty sane. Unclear on what you are looking for? Are you trying to catch them in the act and purse legal actions against them?  I don't think anyone here can help you at this stage. Based on your and your family's disagreement, I would think Step 1 is to go to your treating psychiatrist or psychologist and explain what you wrote down here and see what he/she thinks. It is entirely possible that your contractor is doing shenanigans, just as it is entirely possible that you may need a check-up on medication/dosage, but a trained medical professional can help identify which is more likely. But go see or call a mental health professional immediately -- you want to figure out immediately what is going on either way. The fact that your brain reminded you that you were hospitalized 5 years ago for some issues at the start of this post, may be it trying to signal you that it's overwhelmed right now by the stress of this remodel, your family, etc., and your brain needs some help. Best of luck.
