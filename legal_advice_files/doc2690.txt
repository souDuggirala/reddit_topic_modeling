 So I leave school earlier then most students due to the fact I have early release (yes I am a minor). A man in the school parking lot had requested a ride from me and being the nice guy I am had said yes. He jumps into my car and I drive him down to the block off a corner. Later I get a call from the school which when I answered the police were on the line. I filled out the description the best I could. Later I find out he actually stole the car and did a hit and run. So is there anyway I can get into legal trouble? My friends and counselors say I'll be fine but I'm not sure myself . Also the man claimed he filed the report and everything but he apparently didn't. I don’t think you’re responsible at all. You didn’t know any of that, all you did was give someone a ride. However, you should think twice before letting strangers into your car.
