 I refinanced my loan on a car through a very shady dealership because no other bank/loan company would do it for me. A friend of mine initially put the loan under her name but wanted out after a year because of "credit" reasons. Nonetheless I attempted to get a new loan through a reputable company but was denied because the value of the car was too low. I was referred to this place because apparently they are able to get anyone approved. It turned out to be true and I was able to get the loan under my name for obviously a huge increase in the rate I was paying. When it came time to sign the papers they made me sign up for some 1 year warranty which cost extra (whole different story) but I didn't care because I desperately needed my friend to get off my back so that's why I went through with it. They gave me temporary plates that expired yesterday and I still haven't received the permanent ones. Every time I call and try to speak to somebody there they give me the run around including the manager. They say there going to arrive by Fed-Ex today but they never did. I called again and they said that now the finally have them and will send them to me by tomorrow. There word pretty much means nothing to me but I desperately need these plates nothing more. I'm extremely tired of calling them and getting the run-around so I'm trying to figure out what my best course of action is going forward. I called the DMV by the way and they said they don't even have the title registered under my name and to contact the dealer, so when I brought that up to the dealer they said I called the wrong DMV. Any advice would help, thanks.
