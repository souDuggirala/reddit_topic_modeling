 I'm a licensed NRA firearms instructor and have so far only given small classes to close friends and family. I'm starting to get interest from friends of friends or coworkers. I have no problem teaching these people. My question is should I start covering my ass with some kind of waiver now that I'm teaching people I don't know closely? Specifically to cover some kind of injury on the range. As a note I'm am not expecting to have any kind of injury or accident, safety is my absolute highest priority and my number one plan for accident liability is to continue to be extremely diligent to ensure there are no accidents. But life happens so the question stands.
