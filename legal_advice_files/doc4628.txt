 Long story short, I just leased a brand new jeep, and the dealer's driver burned out the clutch during transport to my dealership. The Dealer gave me a loaner and says they'll have everything taken care of, but I'm concerned there will now be lingering issues. What are my options? Can I ask for a different model? For the more car savvy...will the burned out clutch from a single 100 mile drive lead to other major issues? Not sure where i should post this but thanks in advance for any and all advice.  'm interested in what happened exactly though to "burn it out" so fast in case there was other damage done. Yep. Might be worth having your own mechanic inspect it afterwards as well. Make sure you save paperwork from the repairs and if they don't offer you any, make sure you insist that they provide it to you and that it clearly states what was damaged and by whom. Yeah I'm not great with a clutch and it takes me at least a year to burn one out! And that's on a car with decent HP. I agree with ranthum OP, a clutch change is a pretty standard piece of work and wouldn't be associated with long term issues. I'm interested in what happened exactly though to "burn it out" so fast in case there was other damage done.  I have no idea how they managed to destroy a clutch in 100 miles. But a clutch is a wear item and designed to be replaced. I wouldn't expect any other issues afterwards.
