 This is my first post here and mostly I'm just curious as to what I can / should do about this. I live in the USA, specifically WV. I work for a cellphone company and our store is supposed to have 3 specialists (What I am), a manager and assistant manager. Since the mid of Nov it has just been my manager and I. This means we are both working 8-10+ hour shifts just so the other can have a day off. Some times I'm working almost 15 hours in a day. I have gotten maybe 3 lunch breaks since then. When I ask about this my manager just says "I'm sorry but we are understaffed and we can't take lunches.". Not only this but I have also been written up already because I miscounted one day and thought we were over $5 (I am to tell my manager any time the drawer comes up 5 short or over.). She told me to put it in with the deposit money and she'd take care of it. Well she didn't and deposited the whole thing. Some how that was my fault she forgot. Not only that but since the start of Dec every thing I do I am getting chewed out for. She tells me to do something, I do it, it's not done the way she wanted and I spend 10 minutes being yelled at. Tonight the system we used crashed and created a dupe of a transaction I did causing the drawer to be $15.17 short even though it really isn't. I called twice and no response. So I sent her a text and included a picture (We can view what's called "Transaction history" under the terminal we use.). I'm so stressed from this because I know I'm going to get yelled at for this more.  Thank you for this answer. I am not really allowed to eat while working since I am around computers and cellphones all day. We do have a break room but when I'm the only one there I'm not allowed to be gone from the front of the store for more than 5 minutes. West Virginia generally requires at least a 20 minute meal break, but there are exceptions, including if you are allowed to eat while working.
