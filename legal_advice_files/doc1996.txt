 My friend behaves like a normal teen would. He sometimes likes to take pictures of girls in his grade. He has recently stopped, however, a user on his discord server reported him for possession of child pornography. the girls are underaged, but nothing suggestive is featured in them. they are all clothed, in non sexual ways. can the FBI actually arrest him for possession of these images? I mean celebrities are always followed and photographed in secret, he just is going through changes in his mind and wishes he could talk to girls. He admits this is wrong and has since stopped. Thank you for answering the question Same goes for those naked pictures in photo albums.  No, only nudity for sexual acts/purposes. A picture of a naked child for a medical journal is not a crime. Nudity of minor is a crime regardless  That depicts sexual conduct etc. Else nudists, nudists magazines, videos, artist, art photographers, parents, etc etc would all be in jail. Nudity in itself is not a crime. thelegoboy? is this you??? NONONONONO  What can I do about this. He’s freaking out right now and someone in our server posted an image of an email response from the FBI yes and he is going straight to prison I’d also like to add that no, this is not the behavior of a normal teen. So legal trouble or not, he should stop.  As long as he didn’t take any nude, suggestive or compromising photos he’s good.  No unless actual nudity
