Hello,  


I'm from the UK. I have been a customer of Amazon UK for many years with no problems. 

I ordered a graphics card from Amazon France (approx £350) a few weeks ago and returned it promptly for refund as I bought a cheaper one locally. I paid for insured, tracked and signed UPS shipping. This was delivered, with proof, 2 weeks ago. I have not received any email confirmation that my item has been received and officially logged. When contacting them via email (only option from UK) they just keep telling me according to their records they have not yet received it, and it could take 4 weeks for international returns to process. 

With Amazon UK returns being so efficient, I am very concerned with this return to Amazon France. I am a student so £400 (incl. shipping) is a lot of money to me. 

I wrote them another email giving them 14 days (making it 4 weeks) to process my return. I also cc'd [Jeff@amazon.com](mailto:Jeff@amazon.com) in hope somebody senior will look into it. 

If they fail to refund me i'm afraid my only option is to take it to small claims court. I have no experience of this, and was wondering if anybody has experience or could provide some advice?
