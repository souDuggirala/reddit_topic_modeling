 Hello, I have lived in a large highrise for the past 2 years. 1 month before moveout, they identified a few small areas on the wood floors (approximately 10" each) that they say constitute water damage and as such are claiming a $2000 charge from out security deposit because they claim they entire floor needs to be resurfaced. Despite weekly emails asking for clarification and whether we can get a second opinion, they stopped responding and effectively waited out the clock until after we moved out. I believe that the areas of damage reflect routine "wear and tear", and also have documentation that during a rainstorm a leaking balcony door lead to excessive indoor water that was not repaired for a full week. Would we have a case to bring this to small claims court? Thanks!  You can always litigate your case. Your landlord would need to establish that the deductions were reasonable and you'd have the opportunity to counter that argument. "wear and tear" Water damage probably isn't wear and tear. The argument about the leaking door could be more substantive but would be somewhat complicated.
