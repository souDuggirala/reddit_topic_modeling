 My mom has been working as a real estate agent for over 6 years now and I’ve finally come of age where I can help her around the office, I was setting up a new email signature (on yahoo) for her since what she had was really out dated. Low and behold I see that there was a forwarding address set, this other real estate agent who had worked along side my mom 4 years ago. I quickly removed it and had her reset her password with the cell phone two step. My mom sends and receives a lot of sensitive information from clients on a daily basis (complete social securities for one) and I’m freaking out on what he could of been using all this for. I have not brought it to her attention as to not freak her out... not sure what to do.  She needs to know. If she never gave him the password and permission to access her account, he committed a crime by accessing it. Setting things up this way when he left her is also potentially actionable, both criminally and civilly. If he used that information to take business from her, that adds another layer. Your mom needs to know. Her first conversation should be with her lawyer. The lawyer can advise on next steps. You'll also want to figure out with the provider of the email service how to get records of everything he forwarded to himself. That may be a step for her lawyer or the police to take, but it needs to be on the radar for her meeting with her attorney. We don't have your location, but this seems like the short of thing s local board that licensed real estate agents would appreciate being made aware of.
