 My husband received a multitude of calls from a number that traced back to a major city's police non emergency number, next state over. No messages left. He answered the call today. The "detective" told him he has an arrest warrant out for texting a person who is missing, and the texts were of the sexual variety. This is his work phone and he often gets odd texts, says he has never responded except to say they have the wrong number. This "detective" said he needs to go to the nearest police station in that city and turn himself in. Hubby hung up on him. I called the clerks office and they have nothing on record for him. She told me the police station wouldn't make a call like this. Was he spoofed? Is it a scammer?  Could've been spoofed, could've been a scammer, could've been a prank call... It's impossible for us to know, but whatever it was, it seems pretty clear that this wasn't legitimate. Your husband can ignore the calls (perhaps consider blocking the number) and move on with his life.
