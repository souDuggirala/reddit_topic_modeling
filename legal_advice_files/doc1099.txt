 I have a feeling that my family could have intentionally withheld any information of an inheritance. If I sincerely wasn’t left anything, I’m okay with that. If my family kept it from me for selfish gain, I’m really not okay with that. Is there a way I can try to find out?

In most US counties, there is a Probate Court where the will gets filed in order to carry out the terms of the will. At that point, it's public record, and you can request a copy from the Court. Who’s will and are they still alive?
