 I am renting out my home to a tenant. It is a residential home. He and his wife run a business out of the home. I am aware of this since they asked me for information for a 1099 at the end of the year for a portion of the rent that they pay towards me. I donâ€™t care what they do in the house, but I want to be certain that I am not exposing myself to any liability with them running a business out of my home. To be clear, the work they do is somewhat a staffing agency. Location is California.  It's generally legal to run a business out of a home. Restrictions start to apply if 1) You have non-resident employees working for you there (some jurisdictions it's more than one or two such employees) 2) You have customers/clients regularly attending 3) There is some use that is not consistent with residential, like you are manufacturing something or fixing cars or whatever. Read the zoning regulations as regards your rental home, probably under Planning and Zoning. That should ease your mind.
