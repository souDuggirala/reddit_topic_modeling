 Not sure how to start so I’ll just go. I came home from work today to an upset husband because his father had received a call from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service about a package addressed to him. He and his father have the same first and last name, so they called his dad to find out of the package was for him. My husband and his parents don’t talk a lot, so naturally it made my husband prickle to have his dad call him demanding to know why he was being called about a suspicious package. A couple hours later, I was called by who I can only assume was the same guy to ask about said package. He said it had a very obvious odor of marijuana and wanted to know if my husband was expecting anything from an “Artie Wincklhoff”. Obviously he wasn’t, lol because what is that name? (Sorry to any Artie Wincklhoffs, your name is amazing) Anyway, then he asked if we used marijuana and also mentioned he wasn’t trying to prosecute or anything, just wanted to make sure we weren’t expecting anything. He also asked if he could dispose of it which I told him yes, but followed up with an inquiry of whether or not that was allowed seeing as it wasn’t addressed to me. He asked if we open each other’s mails (we do) and I said that, and he said then I could approve him disposing of the “contraband”. My question is: can we get into any trouble for this? We really didn’t order or ask for any weed mail and we can’t afford to go to court or lose our jobs. Is there anything we should or can do, other than be honest? We have a mortgage and a family to take care of. Also we live in Alaska. Thanks in advance!  No you’re fine.
