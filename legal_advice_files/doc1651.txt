 I've been living in this apartment for four years now on the ground floor. A couple of months ago a boxing gym opened up next door so we share a wall. They blast music all day and there's a lot of yelling. That much I could maybe deal with but the big issue is that they wall mounted all the punching bags on the wall we share. So every time someone is hitting a bag it shakes the wall. I can hear every since punch followed by the metallic squeak of the chain swinging around. Worse at 7-8 every day they have a striking class where people upwards of 20 people are in there punching the bags it's infuriating. I went over there the other day and explained this to the guy that owns it and he said that the wall we share is the only wall he can mount them on because the other walls are either sheet rock or brick and I guess you can't drill into brick? He also told me that they got permission from everyone in their building and they didn't need our permission because we were aren't in their building. After I pressed he shrugged and said he's lived here for 25 years and "It's a noisy neighborhood". Is there anything I can do? Maybe I could ask for a rent reduction? Someone told me I could sue for damages but that's not something I'm comfortable doing. Any advice would be welcome.  Definitely talk to your landlord. Same landlord? Mine is residential his commercial Read your lease and see what it says about noise and quiet enjoyment. Call your landlord right away. Document with emails, photos. Are these both commercial leases or is his commercial and yours residential?  Have you talked to your landlord yet? I would start there.
