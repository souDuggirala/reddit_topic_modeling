 Very vague title, sorry bout that. Was going to buy some stuff off of Alibaba, i know it has a reputation but i havent had problems before and i chose a seller that had 4/5 stars, been on the site for 10 years and the gold mark supplier icon along with like 94% positive feedback. Also asked Alibaba themselves if this seller had any scam complaints earlier and they didnt so all good. Most sellers on alibaba want to talk over whatsapp and prefer to have the money sent through Western Union or the like, i think its to avoid taxes but Alibaba backs you up if you get scammed if you have proof n shit and i archived the chat history every message that was sent. Now the unlucky part is that someone had hacked that account that day and switched out all the contact information including the whatsapp number so i was basically instantly in contact with a scammer and had no idea. Ended up sending over some money and shortly after realised something was wrong, when he gave me the information of the person to send the money over to using WU though, he sent me their full names, state, county, post code, address etc etc. Alibaba says they cant help me due to the account getting hacked, pissed me off a bit but is there something i can do with addresses? Theyre all located in the US, maybe contact the police over there and have em go do something? idk. Sorry that's unfortunate. It's almost certain that the info provided for the US address is also a victim. They are just the "processor" and they don't know it. You may submit this info to the police in the area, but don't be surprised if nothing is done. Unless alibaba refunds you, you're out of luck.
