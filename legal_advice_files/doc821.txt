 Hello. So basically what happened was I was sitting in my room bored and I had the idea of making a fake meme account that was pretending to be my principal. I put picture of him as the profile picture, as well as his real name as the name. I then asked my friends what I should do with the account and they told me to follow everybody because it'd be funny. I did this without realising what the potential consequences were. A few days later and email got sent out by the principal to the whole school detailing the situation that someone was impersonating him on Instagram and he called it an incredible invasion of privacy and said he notified the authorities and contacting Instagram with a government document to prove his identity. Upon the release of this email I immediately deleted the account. The account had my old email which didn't have my name in the address but did on the Google account and it also had my phone number because when logging into the account at one point it forced me to put a number in. Please tell me what could happen to me. I am very worried about the consequences of this. And what should I do? Thank you and your responses are greatly appreciated. It’s illegal to impersonate somebody on social media. Nobody knows what’s going to happen to you but I’d say the likelihood of your principal pressing criminal charges against you is low. You’re probably facing discipline from the school.
