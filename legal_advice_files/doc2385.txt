 So, I will be moving to MA soon but I will be subleasing an apartment until August (and then I might sign under my own name or maybe move) but, in the mean time, do I have any proof of residence? For example, if I was to try and get a Boston public library card, I’d need some sort of proof of residence right? Or when I need a new driver’s license (my current one expires in May).  You need a written lease to protect yourself. You can do a change of address online for $1 or for free at the post office. Not sure about MA, but every DMV I've done only needs to pieces for address. Then your Birth Certificate and SS card for proof of who you are.  the only problem is all of these will have the old tenants name until august  Copy of your lease. Phone bill, utility bill, change of address form. Check MA DMV website. It will list what is accepted.
