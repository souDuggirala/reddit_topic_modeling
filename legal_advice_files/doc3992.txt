 Apologizes if this is not the correct sub for this matter at hand but I couldn't think of a better place since /r/cars doesn't allow this. I've had my mailing address and car registration as my family's house but recently moved out this year in February. My family also moved to a different location (same state, 20 minute drive) and I had updated my mailing address and car registration to my current home address I reside in. I was under my family members car insurance Geico and had zero problems with them (very excellent customer service). However, when I updated my photo ID + car registration address via the NYC DMV website to my current address my family member (whom I'm under on the car insurance policy) was contacted that I will be removed this coming January since that family member is not a owner under registration for my vehicle. I tried speaking with customer service regarding this but kept getting the run around that I must contact the DMV about it. I'm still currently doing research but my question is how is that there was zero problems before I changed my address and I didn't even have my family member under the car registration but now it's a entirely big deal once it was updated and changed? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you! Not sure how I missed that sub lol thank you! I would suggest /r/insurance I appreciate the comment and I do apologize for the wrong sub post. Couldn't find an active sub to ask this question :L and that makes sense. Thank you! This isn't a legal question. Your insurer may simply not have been aware about the previous situation until the address change tipped them off, and they may not wish to insure different family members at different addresses with different cars. They're entitled to make that decision.
