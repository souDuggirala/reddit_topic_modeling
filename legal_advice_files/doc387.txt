 A police office caught me smoking and charged me with unlawful possession of marijuana. Had a tough conversation with family. I need some advice on my next move.  If you can not smoke weed for a year, you will be able to do a first offense diversion program. You have to pay $350 for a "VASAP Class" and attend the classes where they WILL drug test you for drugs and alcohol. If you the driver in a car, you will also lose your license for 6 months, though you can get a restricted license to let you get to and from work/school/church. If you can do that and stay clean for a year, the charge gets dismissed.
