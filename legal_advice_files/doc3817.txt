 Today I got my first careless driving ticket. It technically should have been reckless driving, but he bumped it down due to this being my first offense. I was going 63 in a 40, so Iâ€™m thankful he did this but I was wondering if I should go to court to try and reduce this further so that it does not affect my insurance? Thank you! Yes. On the ticket it says careless driving, so if I go in and the prosecutor chooses to do so, they can bump it back up?  Take the break and pay the fine. Don't risk being charged on the original offense especially if you have no actual grounds to fight it. Sure, you can try that. And you might even get it reduced or you could hire a lawyer to try to get it reduced. On the other hand, the officer may show up, though, and paint you as someone who is ungrateful and clearly hasn't learned his/her lesson and the prosecutor may elect to re-instate a reckless charge and then the judge can decide. It's important to note that nowhere have you said you didn't commit the offense (going 63 in a 40). So you're walking into a courtroom with no actual evidence of innocence and just hoping to get cut an additional break. It's your gamble. I think most people are grateful when they're cut a break, pay the fine, accept the consequences, and move on, but I cannot say that trying to fight it further would be unsuccessful with absolute certainty. But it could also lead to more severe consequences than what you're facing now.
