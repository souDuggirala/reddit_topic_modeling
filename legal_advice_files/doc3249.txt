 I worked as a salary employee at a restaurant in North Carolima, USA, a few months back as a stop gap job when moving. My employment ended due to an employee of a different store telling the Regional Manager that I had reason to believe another manager was sexually harrasing an employee (I did, and was in the process of bringing to my managers attention). His immediate response was to suspend me, though I never completed any paperwork relating to a suspension (as is required in my state). It has now been over 3 months with no word from them, I have received no statement on my termination or release from suspension. A friend of mine replaced me as the manager and has told me my name has not appeared on the schedule so as far as I'm aware there's technically no cause for termination (IE missing work). I have moved on with my life and have found gainful employment. But this just feels wrong, and I'm wondering what my rights are here. Is there any legal action I could pursue at this point?
