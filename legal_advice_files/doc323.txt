 It would be a fun app to use if not, but I donâ€™t want to get in trouble. Does anyone know anything about this app? Omg what a lamo NY here. I was wondering why the app is available is it is considered illegal Using Ohio as an example, just because I"m sort-of familiar with Ohio law (and you didn't list your location): [2917.21 Telecommunications harassment.](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2917.21) 's control, to another, if the caller does any of the following: ; Violation is a first-degree misdemeanor on the first offense, and a 5th degree felony on subsequent offenses. A prosecutor with a wild hair up their ass could go for multiple charges for each call and/or each person called. Not all states have these laws, so they might find something else that's close that'd be a lot worse.
