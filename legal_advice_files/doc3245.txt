 This is not something that directly happened to me. A substitute teacher was in our class one day. She is very strict (I think she was in military or something like that). Someone came late and she told her to do 50 push-ups before coming in. A student forgot his stuff, she told him to do 20 push-ups. Another teacher saw a student running in the school during break and made him run in the school for 30 minutes as a punishment. Take note that nothing of this happened during physical education classes. I know physical punishment is illegal in Canada, but is this type of punishment I described is illegal ?  There are laws that prohibit schools from using violence as a punishment (or more generally from using violence at all), but there is no way these laws extend to compelled physical activity. If parents don't like it they can complain to the school board. NAL, but I would assume that there is a school associated punishment for being late, etc. if the sub used pushups or running as an alternative to the punishment the school would give (say detention or a tardy mark or whatever) then I feel like that would be ok. If they were physically forced to run/pushups or would have had extra punishment outside the norm for the school for not running/pushups that might be a different story. Again though I’m not sure and I’m not a lawyer this is just my opinion
