 Hi, I am currently staying a house with a male roommate, my girlfriend as well as his, and we have started to come to disagreement about the different rules and issues with the house we currently reside in and now he is threatening to kick us out, even though I pay a higher amount in rent than he himself does, with receipts is there a possible way I could add my name to the lease so that way he canâ€™t officially kick us out?  The amount of rent doesn't matter. It only depends on the terms of the lease(s) between you, your roommate, and the landlord.  If he's the master tenant and you're not on the lease then he is effectively your landlord and you are a month to month tenant. He can terminate your tenancy at any time with proper notice.
