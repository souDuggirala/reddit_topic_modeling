 California. When I left my last employer they gave me my company phone. It's been 7 months and the cell service still works so I've been using it here and there. I'm not sure if company didn't care or they didn't check, maybe the latter. Could I get in legal trouble for making calls either personal or work related? Thanks Unless they told you otherwise, they can come after you for the cost of the service they are/were paying for since you left the company. The most likely outcome is someone will eventually notice and just shut off service and your phone doesn’t work. But technically you stole the phone and by continuing to use it you’re stealing from them as they’re paying your bill. They could go to the police for the theft and also demand repayment. Edit: okay I see they gave you the phone, but it’s unlikely with the intent you’d still be using their plan.  Is there any legal ramification I was allowed to keep the phone. The company is paying for the service. You should stop using it. They gave you the phone, or just didn't ask for it back? And who is paying for the service?
