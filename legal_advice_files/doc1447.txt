 A client had contacted me to design a simple logo for some T-shirt’s. After a long period of time of me sending him sketches and drawings we agreed on one we liked. However as the logo was being brought into photoshop there were many changes he wanted and work arounds. I worked closely with him day after day but ultimately dropped him as a client. Months go by with no contact yet I noticed he had gotten his T-shirt’s made. Looking closer would it you know it’s my design however it’s changed, not a lot, but enough. What sort of options do I have?  Gotcha Thank you I want to focus on why you dropped him as a client. I assume the client expected an unlimited number of revisions to be included in the base price. If you have this in place, please disregard but in the future, set clear expectations. X number of revisions are included. After that additional x per revision. Invoices payable upon completion. It'll cut down on the number of revisions you do across the board and you'll have more time to devote to other billable work. Goid luck OP. OP created it, therefore OP owns the copyright until such time that OP transfers or licenses the copyright to someone else. If you have the drafts, emails, and other information showing that you created the logo and weren't paid you can sue to recover the price you would have charged for the rights. Is it your logo? Copyrighted, or anything that would prevent others from using it?
