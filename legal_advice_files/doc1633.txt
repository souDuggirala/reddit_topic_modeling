 Hi, I live in Australia. There's a wasp nest on my letter box and I put off getting rid of it because, you know, wasps are assholes. Today, the postman delivered a letter to my door (instead of the mailbox), asked if I knew if there was a wasp nest on my letter box (I said yes...) and told me he was stung by one because he knocked the mailbox. After he left, I got a stick and knocked the nest off. The postman was not upset, he seemed jovial but that's beside the point. Would he have a case to sue me because of this? A very very slim case - but I'd be getting rid of the wasps asap anyway. He'd be covered by compo and I doubt he'd have any serious injuries anyway so the chance of getting sued is pretty low (almost zero)
