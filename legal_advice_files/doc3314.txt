 I see most parents share nude photos of their infants, which is ok I guess. I wouldn't but it's legal I guess? But recently one of my relatives posted photos of her 7 turning 8 year old daughter nude in tge bath tub. My while family and all her friends think it's fine. I guess Im the minority in this case. Basically my question is what age does it have ramifications and is ok as long as it's the parents? I've just been feeling increasingly confused on the laws. Also I live in Canada, New Brunswick. Any knowledge on this subject would be great. Ty. It's bothered me for years now. I guess I understand that. Kinda. I just find it so odd. Thank you for your answer. I edited my comment and linked to Canada's definition of child pornography. ; Bathtub photos generally don't meet those criteria. Common sense dictates that a bathtub photo of a 7 year old is probably ok, but when you're still taking photos of your child in the bathtub through the age of 14, that may be unreasonable, even if not explicitly illegal. Ok. But let's say I took a photo of my 14 year old in the tub. Why would that be not on but a 7 year old is? It's not even a huge deal. I just don't understand. If a young girl sends nudes even if not sexual necessarily it's child pirn distribution. But if I send someone my nude child it isn't. "Child" means under 18. Bathtub photos of small children are generally ok, not to mention those kinds of photos are generally non-sexual in nature. []()
