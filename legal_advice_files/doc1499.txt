 The company I work for is cutting a number of staff for a client. They have offered me a transfer to a new client with a pay cut but it's only for a month. If I decide to take the layoff would it be a voluntary quit or a layoff? Also, as they haven't provided adequate notice for the layoff, do I have any recourse? Pennsylvania.  If you took the layoff instead of the new job, it may not matter. A refusal of suitable work can render you ineligible for unemployment. But, whether or not it's suitable because of the pay cut would have to be looked at by the unemployment office. If the job is not suitable, then you'd still be considered laid off for unemployment purposes. 't provided adequate notice for the layoff, do I have any recourse? Unless this is a [WARN Act]() layoff subject to WARN Act protections or you have a separate contract, there is no notice required. If it is a WARN Act layoff, that law has remedies. If you have contractual protection, you'll have to look to your contract to see.
