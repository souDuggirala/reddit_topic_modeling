 I work at an insurance call centre. My job has been doing this for about 5 months now. They tried to calm us all down when we found out by promising us all a raise. It never happened. I’m quitting soon and I don’t care if they try to fire me but I want to report this to the proper authorities, for the safe of my friends and sister who works there. We get paid minimum wage, new hires are getting paid $18 an hour for doing less work. I answered the same, and my answer was censored as "not helpful". Don't understand why, it's so obvious.  Can’t think of any possible law they’re breaking .. maybe spend your time learning to better negotiate a contract instead of trying to tell on your employer for something you perceive as unfair  This is not illegal in Ontario unless the difference in pay is motivated by race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or other human rights protected grounds. You can try to renegotiate, or resign, as you see fit.  I’m in Ontario Where in Canada are you? I doubt that's illegal anywhere but Quebec has some weird labour laws.
