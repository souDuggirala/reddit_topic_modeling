 Long time lurker first time poster. I am a freshman in High school and I live in in Kansas, along with my 18 year old sister, grandmother, and mother. My uncle on my moms side on multiple occasions has threatened me, my sister, and my mom to attack us, whether just beating us or using one of his many guns. Before we moved, he was on our old property and we ended up calling the cops to have him removed, he's been arrested for a DUI and assault before. He has also physically attacked my grandmother before, but she just lets all this happen because "he wouldn't let her see her three grandkids" (12, 9, 5). The one thats finally pushed us to the edge happened last night. My grandmother had brought the three of them over as we hadnt seen them for almost a year, and we used to be close. Almost immediately after her arriving, my uncle drove into our driveway, while my mother was telling to get off the property with his kids. He then got in her face and screamed at her for a bunch of things, this got my grandmothers attention as she was inside. She told him to leave too, and gave him the kids. He of course did not, and he then then threatened to shoot me, and my sister, as well as my mother, and then yelled at the entire neighbourhood that my mother raped him when he was 7. I am also pretty sure he abuses his kids. I just want to know what we can do. [removed] [deleted]
