 My neighbors are addicted to crystal meth. This month they have stolen so much water from my faucet they have doubled my water bill. My wife and two kids birthdays are all within two weeks of each other and this hit is substantial right now. They’re scary people that you can hear physically fighting/screaming almost every night, they have woke my kids up crying on Christmas Eve, I’ve caught them smoking meth outside of my daughters window at 2 in the morning. I own this house and the person that owns the house next door let’s this couple squat there. What can I do about this water bill and do I have any legal recourse for all the drug activity/scaring my kids to death every night? I don’t hate or judge anyone but this is ruining my life and taking a terrible toll on my family.
