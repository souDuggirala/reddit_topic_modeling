 Is this legal to put in the common area of condo? Neighboor is adding a bathroom and plumbed it through common stairwell. The pipe is in the corner of said common area but the owner of the unit never asked us other owners if it was ok. I live in Massachusetts. The building has 4 units total ( 1 that I own and live in) and a bathroom is being added upstairs in my neighbor's unit. I usually wouldn't care but this owner and the construction team has been a pain in the ass. Including leaving the common areas a mess after doing work and everything being dragged out now for a couple years. Also in the past he has had uninsured workers/company doing the work. He has legally bought the addic upstairs and is adding it to his unit. So is this even legal to just plumb his bathroom through our common area without asking the 3 other owners? Just because it's permitted doesn't mean it's up to code.  I'm pretty sure it may be permitted....atleast it was but I'll double check. I'm more wondering about the legality of just having a pipe go through the common area. It is in the corner and out of the way I'm just pissed he didn't bring it to any of the other owners attention. So......... Report the possibly unpermitted/ almost certainly against code work to the appropriate authorities, maybe? I know we busted his balls because his last workers weren't insured and then he brought people in who were. The guy doing the work today was just in a regular car (not a business truck) . When we checked about 8 months ago permits were pulled; however, to this day non of them are posted or anywhere to actually be seen. Sounds like he didn’t even pull permits if they are doing that. Really doesn’t sound like that would be to code, regardless of the answers to your other questions.
