My lawyer said there was a 21 day time limit for me to pay a car crash related settlement to State Farm. I sent the check by mail with 6 days to spare but now there’s one day left and they haven’t received it yet. Will there be repercussions? Did you send it return receipt requested?  Because that's the proof to show you did mail it on time.

Also, call your lawyer. Have you talked to your lawyer about this?
