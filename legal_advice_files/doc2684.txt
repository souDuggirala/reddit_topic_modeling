 So at my school, as I'm sure most of you are aware, we have several different types of parking. I have a commuter pass, which allows me to park in certain lots. After 10am, the commuter lots are typically full. So for the past month, I have been parking in the paid permit lots. I recently got a ticket for this. Apparently in some random clause in their policy, I'm not allowed to pay for parking because I have a commuter permit. I didn't sign anything. I didn't know this. I barely spend any money on myself and there goes $40 I could've bought food with because they trapped me in some weird game of gotcha. I'm pissed. Is there anything I can do about this? Will do  I would go attempt to speak to the director or main person in charge. State your case. In person may be sympathetic to you.  I did appeal it and it got denied. I didn't actually go into the office though.  Go to. Your transportation services at your school and see if you can appeal it.
