 My parent got divorced about 5 years ago and recently my Dad married a girl who we’ll name M, she makes all of the time that me and my sister spend at his house a living hell. She doesn’t respect the boundaries we set and is rude and nasty to us and my Mom. I’m 14 and living in Utah and was wondering if there is any way I don’t have to see them.
