 I'm thinking about divorcing my husband. It's just not working anymore, we've both made mistakes/were unfaithful and I just don't think it's salvageable anymore. Anyways, he has debt, I don't. We have a joint account but I also have my own account with another bank. If his debt is through the bank with our joint account, will I be responsible? I don't think he's been even using money from the joint account to pay off his debt but when I take my portion of the joint account money back he may be stuck financially. But will I legally be required to pay off the debt? Or assist in paying?  I would rather not have to deal with an attorney if I can help it. Especially if we can negotiate it ourselves but this could get messy I suppose. So I see what you're saying.  It'll depend on a lot of facts about how that debt was accrued and paid for, and how you've handled your finances during your marriage more generally, and may even depend on what you can negotiate. Speak to a divorce attorney rather than trying to DIY this - it'll probably be the cheaper option.
