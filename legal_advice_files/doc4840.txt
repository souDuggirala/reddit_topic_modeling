 I live in NJ and was driving on a highway going 78mph last I saw my speed and in the middle lane, I realize my exit was coming up and I moved somewhat abruptly into the exit while slowing down (I genuinely made sure there were no cars around before doing this). After coming off the exit I got pulled over and given a citation for 81 in a 55 in addition to an unsafe lane change citation. In total this is 6 points. I was wondering what you guys think is the best course of action? If I pay the fines it is $413 but keep the points. I'm thinking of delaying the court date as I will be out of state for college on the original date, and go to court in December to plead for a reduction. Has anyone had any similar experience or advice? They can give you any number of tickets on a traffic stop. Seat belt stops use to be like that. First advice is keep it under 26 over. Second, is that it doesn't hurt to try, but, on what basis would you fight the ticket/ask for a reduction? For 6 points you might want to talk to a traffic attorney.
