 Hello, My ex-wife wants to send my son to private school. He's four and hasn't started school yet. We have joint legal and physical custody. My reasons are not necessarily relevant to the question, but I will say that I'm not concerned about the cost. It has more to do with wanting him to have a better sense of community and the world around him. Also, better exposure to children that do not have the same privilege that he has. Anyway, my question is: can she unilaterally make that decision or do we both need to agree? What happens if we don't agree? Is there a default? I have not posed this to my attorney yet, frankly because I don't want to pay their fee for answering a question. I wanted to do some due diligence first. ðŸ˜€ Thank you for your assistance. Call up your attorney again, if you can't agree it's back to court unfortunately  If you canâ€™t agree on the surface and donâ€™t want to go back to court, maybe you can come to a compromise by adding in other aspects that fit what you each want, like private school but weekly swim lessons at the local YMCA, or public school but a private tutor.  Yep. It depends on the parenting and how the schooling section is laid out. If it's 50/50 then she can't do it without your consent.  Removed because not legal advice  If you have the means, why would you deny your child a private school education?  If you have joint legal custody, she can't override you. You also can not exactly override her. If y'all can't agree, y'all will have to go back to court.
