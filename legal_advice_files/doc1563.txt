 I am an 18 year old male in Alabama. I am currently in an emergency room for attempting suicide. My parents and the local mental health services are trying to send me to a psychiatric hospital. I am refusing to go voluntarily. I found a few resources online concerning civil commitments in Alabama, bit I am still confused whether or not this is legal in my situation. Can they really send me to a psychiatric hospital against my will? Can anyone give me any legal advice on this matter? Also, I am not looking for any advice concerning my mental health or whether or not I should go to a psychiatric hospital. I am strictly requesting advice on the legality of this situation. I realize my response is coming a bit late but if you can arrange to be committed voluntarily then do it. Under federal law an involuntary commitment is treated the same as a felony conviction with respect to possession of a firearm. Yes, they can legally involuntarily commit you. Look, whatever is going on in your life that caused you to attempt suicide needs to stop, and you need help to deal with whatever that might be. Let them commit you. Let them HELP YOU.  Yes they can make you go against your will and hold you for 72 hours without getting the courts involved. Attempted suicide is one of the main reasons for the 72 hour hold. You can refuse to go but they can and will force you to go, i.e. use restraints. It is better if you cooperate with them. You'll absolutely be involuntarily committed. You'll be held for a minimum of 72 hours and then the doctor will decide if you are healthy enough to be released.  Attempted suicide is one of the main reasons to legally have someone involuntary committed for a mental health evaluation.  Yes, you can be involuntarily committed.
