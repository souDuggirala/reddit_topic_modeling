I'm getting mixed messages through google searches, so wanted to ask here real quick. I've been a resident of VA for 5+ years, so residency isn't an issue. How do I go about changing my name (both first and last)?  Wanting to change my name. Is this as a result of marriage or as a result of you just wanting to change your name?
