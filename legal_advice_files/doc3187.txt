 I recently bought a $50 Google Play gift card for a promotion and have been spending hours a day contacting various support people to get the reward I was promised with no success. If a small local shop took my money without giving me what they promised, it would be theoretically easy to get a refund by bringing a cop to the store or suing in small claims court. Is this possible with a big company such as Google or am I legally out of luck? I must have been unclear, the card was bought online. I am saying that since Google is so big I can't just walk into a store with a cop. I guess I am just acting if someone can realistically sue a large company like Google in small claims court. Taking a cop to the store that sold you the card won't do anything. Suing the local shop also won't do anything. You bought the card from them, they gave you the card. These "promotions" are run by tons of mobile games in conjunction with Google, and are not awarded by Google, rather by the company that maintains the game. If you've not contacted Clash of Clan's support, I suggest you do so. They are likely going to be the only ones that can help here. Taking google to small claims court won't even be possible if you don't live in CA, and taking a real lawsuit against them is going to cost a hell of a lot more than $50.  It was a promotion where if you purchase and redeem a card on your Google Play account, you get rewards in Clash of Clans. I got the face value of the card applied to my Google Play account when I redeemed the card but did not receive the promotional items.  [removed] What do you mean "for a promotion"? Did you purchase a card that had no value on it?
