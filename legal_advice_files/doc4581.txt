 I was planning on moving early next month anyways, but for various reasons that don't really need telling her, my roommate is mad at me. He's decided to lock me out of the house, and start leaving my things outside on the porch for me to collect. He's demanding I schedule time with him to get my other things. My problem is I don't have a lease or written agreement with him, but I have paid my bills and rent through to the 5th. Can he legally lock me out like this? Or do I (as I fear) have no legal recourse? Thanks. Nothing important is damaged as of yet, and I'm heading there tonight to get whatever I can. If he makes a fuss I'll call the cops.  Paid through cash app and previously venmo.  r/phneri's comment is spot on. I'd only add that I hope you have receipts for the rent you've paid. You're a month to month tenant with currently paid rent in a very tenant-friendly state. You can call the police and have them attempt to settle the civil dispute. You can ALSO sue his ass off for any damages you incur to your property, your stolen rent, and any expenses you incur due to being unlawfully evicted.  I donâ€™t think he can kick you out. I think he has to give a 30 day notice
