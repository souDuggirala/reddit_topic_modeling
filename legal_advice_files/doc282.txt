 Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm a single mother that goes to college. A little while ago I asked a male friend if he could babysit my child for a few hours while I went to class. Can I sue him for child support if he doesn't accept pay because he took on a fatherly role? I'm fairly certain I can convince the court that he took on a fatherly role and therefore I deserve child support payments. Also, will he have a right to see my children? Thank you. Well, you shouldn't be.  A question like this should be posted over in /r/shittylegaladvice I'm entirely serious.  [They are a troll.](=20100727081058AAOYFCB guccounter=1)  No, babysitting for free does not make someone responsible for raising your children.  Grow up. You can only get child support from the actual biological father of your child, AND you should not be doing that to done innocent babysitter who helped you out. Also in case this is a troll post, suck my ass You're not even a creative troll. You stole this one from Quora.  No. What the fuck is wrong with you?
