  'm a very young (comparable to the industry) new manager who got tasked with building an office, and given our highly litigious society and nature of our work, my mind went there first. I don't blame you at all. But considering you even went to HR first shows you're doing all the right things. Just keep it up and good luck with the new office!  Thank you for your response.  Thank you for the explanation, the looking for cause to deny benefits makes a lot more sense. I'm a very young (comparable to the industry) new manager who got tasked with building an office, and given our highly litigious society and nature of our work, my mind went there first. And considering I cleared this all with HR in advance and they knew lack of specific documents but said it was ok to anyways, I just wasn't expecting what seems like a lot of blowback. Thanks again! You have no worry about a wrongful termination. Assuming they did not have a contract stating otherwise, you can fire an employee simply for the sky being blue and them being the closest person you can fire for it. Just answer honestly and let the TWC do their thing. They're most likely looking to see if they can deny unemployment (due to a firing "for cause"), not if you did anything wrong.  Probably not. TWC is looking to see if they can classify him as being fired for cause, which means they don’t have to pay him. Doesn’t sound like you have the evidence they would need for that. Just respond to them honestly.
