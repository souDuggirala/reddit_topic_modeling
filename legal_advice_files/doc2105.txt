 Here is the link to the previous post: =reddit-android I have been calling the state each day this week to check the status of my license. Yesterday I was notified that they had received the required form from my employer but returned it as they had put the hire date for 2019 (i was hired in 2017). I called my HR department and they at first said they had no knowledge of a wrong date on the form and were pushing me off the phone to talk to the state instead. After enough fighting over the issue my HR dept finally said they found the email from the state that has the returned form and said they would send it to the correct dept to fix it and send it in. This call took place this morning, so I called back this afternoon to verify that it was done. I was told they can't guarantee me that it will be done by today, most likely not til next week, but it's been sent with "highest importance". I have now missed 2 full weeks of work due to this issue, and by the time HR sends in the form it will take state a day or two to process so I may not even be able to go back in to work until the end of the week. I will have missed more than 75% of this pay period alone. I am struggling to get my bills paid and I know it's only going to get worse with my next even smaller possibly non-existent paycheck. Do I have grounds to file a civil lawsuit for loss of wages? I feel like they don't understand how severely they have damaged my financial situation. I'm at risk of getting my car repo'ed not to mention numerous bills and late fees that won't be getting paid on my next paycheck. I could barely cover rent for the month.
