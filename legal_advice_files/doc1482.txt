 Hello, I know a person, let's call her Jane Doe, who got sued for accruing a debt on a credit card. She moved and never received a notice to appear in court, as they sent the notice to the wrong address. The case defaulted in the people who are suing her's favor. When I ask her if she's ever opened a credit card, she says she never remembered opening a credit card, and she says the money that they claim she owes would have never been spent by her in such a large quantity even if she had ever spent on credit. I've tried legal aid hotlines, but either they don't offer pro bono services or they don't offer them to non citizens. Jane Doe's English skills are not the best either so she struggles to make sense of this situation. I think someone opened a credit card in her name, spent a lot of money before the credit card company closed the account due to nobody paying the bills, and now she (after having her identity stolen) is now being ordered to pay several thousand dollars (she is extremely no income and barely makes anything to survive) for a credit card that she never opened after not showing up to court because they sent the notice to the wrong address.  Asked and answered earlier today.
