 I live in a rural duplex upstairs. I admittedly texted her drunken idiotic texts and was taken to court where she was awarded a 12-month harassment order. Now she is calling 911 over any little thing including alleged loud bass. I have informed my landlords of 5+ years of her allegations. Today a deputy showed up accusing me of a noise complaint. Luckily my daughter was present and was able to testify of the neighbors noise issues. I immediately notified my landlord of the issue. My question is; do I have any legal recourse to address her annoying harassment? FYI-Minnesota, no prior legal issues.  I would not be doing a lot of talking to the police. If they show up, don't help them investigate whatever they are responding to. [removed] [removed] Wtf  They should what? They should?  I’m a perfect tenant. I’m looking..  She’s allowed to call the police if she believes there’s a violation. It would behoove you to work very hard to avoid causing issues. The restraining order she was awarded will mean that in any legal issue between you and her you’re going to be at a disadvantage. You might want to consider finding somewhere else to live when your lease is up.
