 Preface: no action has been taken yet but I am wondering what the impact could be. I posted an ad on a local craigslist type website asking for someone to fix 2 windows in a house im selling. I was contacted by an individual who checked the windows and what fixing them entailed, which included replacing 4 window sash balances. I then had him message me a guarentee of completion to satisfaction with my down payment of half and then the remaining payment once completed. I accepted and he started immediately, now today morning he has just contacted me stating that he needs and extra amount of money per window which near double the price because of the time he has spent kn the window, he said should i not pay the extra that he will place a mechanics lein on the house. Firstly is this a genuine possibility as it wasnt originally mentioned in the contract. And second how should i go about resolving this or if he does place a lein on the house, should i refute it or simply pay it.
