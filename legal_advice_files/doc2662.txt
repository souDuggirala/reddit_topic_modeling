 So last night on my way home from work I got a stop sign ticket. I know the cop was behind me and I counted to like 3 before I went and proceeded to get pulled over. What are my chances if I go into court to fight it? I know it's my word against his but I truly didn't run the stop sign and don't want to pay a 150+ ticket. Or what are my chances at getting some community service instead?  You can probably go to the police station and ask for it. IANAL, but if they say no, I imagine there is some kind of court petition for release of footage, it’ll be called petition for release of evidence or something of that nature.  Is there a way to request the video footage before the court date? His body cam may still have a partial shot, and I would definitely inquire if they are supposed to have dash cams rolling. (I would be really surprised if he works for a department that has body cams that doesn’t also have car cams.)  Yes, I have a manual and I remember switching from 2nd to neutral, counting and then going.  Did you come to a full and complete stop? Because if your car was moving at all, you didnt stop.  I tried that but he only had a body camera on him. I requested it at the scene but he informed me it was only on his person.  Since he was behind you, you should be able to request his dash cam footage as evidence. If he didn’t have it rolling, a judge is likely to rule in your favor. If he did, you can show that you didn’t run the stop sign.
