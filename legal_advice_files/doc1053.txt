 My boyfriend was working at a neighborhood wine bar for a little over a year. His employers were paying him in cash (literal cash, and then they switched to Venmo). He never filled out a W4 or any tax paperwork when he started and I jokingly made the comment, “you better hope no one reports them to the IRS because the government will want their taxes!” His now former boss called him for his SSN and address and told him to keep an eye out for his W2 coming in the mail. What does this mean for him? That he’s just going to owe a bunch of money? Is this a bigger deal than we realize?  It can mean hot water for the business if they failed to pay their share of taxes. You can’t make other people take care of themselves, unfortunately. Perhaps your boyfriend will learn a lesson. Ooo okay thanks for that tip! I’ll make sure he does that. I am facepalming because I told him from the very beginning to figure that stuff out but he never did and now will likely owe a ton of money. The extremely petty side of me hoped that it meant hot water for the business, always hated the owners. If the employer failed to pay their share of taxes it will be a problem for your boyfriend and the employer. He should look at the w2 when it comes and see if it is accurate and if the employer paid its share of taxes. If not, he can complain to the IRS. Your boyfriend will need to pay his taxes if there was nothing withheld.  I guess he should have just been more diligent about submitting his W4 that way he wouldn’t be stuck paying it all now. That whole place is fishy and I hate the way they run their business so I was hoping this meant hot water for them. Alas! Thanks for replying though.  It means he'll know how much income he needs to report, rather than having to reconstruct it from his personal records. It was taxable to him all along.
