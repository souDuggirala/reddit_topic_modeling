 A friend of mine runs an auto repair shop and is licensed for performing NYS Inspections. He's saying that customers in his parking lot who have expired inspection stickers, even if they are there waiting to get their inspection done, are getting ticketed by local police. This is driving away business as customers are afraid to park in his parking lot. [Image of parking lot layout](=w287-h437-no) How should he proceed with this? that's a good point. I'll mention that to him. You could, but looking at the satellite view the cars are very clearly parked in front of what appears to be a fire lane. I suspect this is a large part of the issue.  I'm looking at the satellite view and I don't think he had lines drawn in his parking lot for spaces. I advised him to reach out to Town Code Enforcement. The violations are for parking outside of a designated parking space. This is likely a town ordinance and may apply to public vehicular areas.  [removed] they are being placed on cars by the town code enforcement, not police? Yes I would call the police and asked them to please refrain from coming on your property that youâ€™re also certified to do inspections
