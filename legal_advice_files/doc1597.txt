 My brother got his first DWI back in April of 2016, his BAC was .125. It's on his record as a class B misdemeanor. He just got his second DWI last week and has court this Friday. He refused to take the breathalyzer or get blood drawn but on his paperwork, it says he willingly gave his blood even though they had to get a warrant. When we got the car out of the storage, the front left headlight was gone and the car had HPD ACCID written on the back of his car. He can't remember if he hit something or not. He doesn't want to get a lawyer but I am insisting he does. What do y'all suggest to do about this case? How can we beat it to get min. suspension of his license to 180 days instead of 1 year?  't remember if he hit something or not ... He doesn't want to get a lawyer but I am insisting he does. If you're the insisting kind of brother, insist on getting him into rehab asap, especially before he kills someone. From a legal perspective, as well, since this is a legal forum, often judges like it when someone acknowledges their problems and takes corrective steps (like rehab, AA, whatever) before the court orders them to. It shows that he's taking the shit seriously.  Very unlikely he will get his license suspended for less than 1 year. Judges donâ€™t take kindly to 2nd DWIs. Contact a DWI lawyer in your area ASAP. They will know a lot more than people on reddit.
