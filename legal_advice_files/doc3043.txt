 This may be a dumb question. I am trying to find out if a non-DOT drug screen can be used against an employee at a company that follows DOT regulations. Any helpful input appreciated.  "They are wrong" lmfao that sounds ridiculous... Looks like I was the one who was wrong, it is of course the 5 panel, but the opioids are separated into their own little information slot, which was initiated January 1st 2018, according to your link. My bad, it's still a 5-panel, just with more details. They are wrong. [here]() For DOT regulated drug test the DOT could go after them, I have never seen it though. Interesting, the DOT at my workplace is 9 panel while the non-dot is a 5 panel Yes, absolutely.  DOT are 5 panel, non DOT can test whatever although most stick with the same 5 panel. If you're asking if you can get in trouble for failing a drug test not administered by the DOT the answer is yes.  Are you in a DOT role? Aren't DOT drug screenings testing for the same things on w non-DOT DT? The DOT one just adds on a few more, detailed panels?
