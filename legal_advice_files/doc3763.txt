 Us school students decided to make a t shirt as a souvenir as this is our last year at school. The design is very much smoothed out version of our school's logo like most key elements have been smoothed out but one could tell that it's a rip-off from the school's logo very easily. Can the school sue us if we use the logo without prior permission? Like we already tried approaching but our principal didn't want us to waste time on making souvenirs.  Thank you oml I don't think I need to freak out this much xD If the logo is trademarked, you can't use it without permission in the fashion you describe. You can be sued for trademark infringement if you do. I have no idea how likely it would be that the school sues you. I would venture to guess that they would opt to handle it internally, which may or may not include disciplinary measures, but again, that's only a guess. What position would that put us in? What could be the consequences ?  's a rip-off from the school's logo very easily So, potentially copyright/trademark infringement? Yes. Will they? I don't know. Are you in primary school? Would be pretty odd for a school to sue a bunch of minors, but it's definitely an option for them. 't want us to waste time on making souvenirs. Sounds like the answer is "No."
