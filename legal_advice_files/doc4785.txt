 My uncle was not allowed to renew his driver's license in Illinois when it expired due to thousands of dollars worth of tickets owed. He recently was offered a job in Wisconsin and is living with a co-worker through the week but still resides in Illinois for the weekend. He got the license in Wisconsin under "dual residency" (at least that's what he says). But he is also collecting Illinois benefits and healthcare. Is there a risk of getting into more legal trouble this way?  That's exactly what my entire family and I thought, but I am telling you he DID get the license. He does not have two. He was refused in Illinois due to the money he owes in tickets but Wisconsin gave him one. You can't get two licenses. DMVs communicate with each other and history is brought up. You didn't think they didn't think of that did you?  Can you please elaborate on that? I thought similarly but he actually did get the license. WI and IL are driver license compact states so he isn't going to be able to get a WI license anyway.  Yes that's fraud.
