 Let's say your accused of a crime but then found innocent in court. Does that go on your record the same way as someone who is found guilty of a crime and spent prison time and recently released? Would it effect you searching for work? Could someone be fired for a false crime accusation? IANAL It's on your record as not guilty. Anyone running a cursory background check would find it and see it says not guilty (or whatever the exact legal paperwork says) and probably gloss over it.  A criminal record contains information on arrests, charges, and outcomes. The record for someone found "not guilty" would show an arrest on something, a charge on something, and then a "not guilty" on that something.
