 I'm looking to get my License To Carry here in Texas, however the apartment complex I live in has a notice posted, 30.07 unable to openly carry. I have read up on the 30.06 and 30.07 and from my understanding I though they where only able to be used when entering a place of business such as a grocery store or the like. The sign is not posted on the entrance to the leasing office either, only the gates to enter the premises. Some important information about the complex is it is advertised as student housing, however it is not considered a dormitory as it is not affiliated with any one college/university within Austin and you do not have to be enrolled in school to live there. Does the posting of the 30.07 sign entering my complex apply or am I still able to open carry if I so wish or does that posting prevent me from open carry? You should re-read the lease because if the complex doesnâ€™t allow firearms at all, then you are bound by those lease terms and could potentially be evicted for having firearms.  Well according to the lease, if I remember correctly, no firearms are allowed in the complex at all, however it has been a while since I looked over the lease. Check your lease, it may have more specific language. But generally speaking, the apartment complex does have the right to post 30.07 or 30.06 signs. That would apply to all common areas, such as parking lots, leasing offices, etc.
