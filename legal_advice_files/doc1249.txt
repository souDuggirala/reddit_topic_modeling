 Throwaway because Reasons. I work for a doctors office that offers services that are intended to promote wellness. I received an email from someone within the organisation stating that it is a requirement of my management position to undergo a medical examination which would be performed by our team of inhouse doctors and clinicians. They have offered to pay for the medical examination in its entirety, which is actually not cheap, and a tremendous benefit should i choose to accept it. The part that makes me wary, is them saying that it is a requirement of my management position. It is possible that this is a miscommunication, however a part of me is afraid to say no to these treatments because i could lose my job. I do have a few medical problems that i will not get into, however they do not generally get in the way of me doing my job and i already have doctors that i'm working with. So my question is, Is this Legal? If i deny this service would they be able to use it against me. I have not signed anything from them stating that i agree to this being a condition of my employment. For context i am in the United States.
