 Tonight I'm going out bowling with a friend. His mother and my mother despise each other after recent events. If my mother changes her mind, can she report an abduction/ kidnapping? Is there any way to prevent this from happening? I'm a 13 year old in the US.  I probably am, but I needed a second opinion on the matter because of the history between both of them. It really sounds like youre psyching yourself out abt this whole thing. Can she claim it? Yes. Whether the police will treat it as such is unlikely. She can report to the police that you ran away from home and you can be returned home. She has never done anything of the sort but she has been acting erratically every time I mention the mothers name. I'm probably going to end up warning my father about my situation now. Is she likely to falsely report kidnapping? Does she do that kind of thing often? See if you can get it in writing. Like, text her “still good with my going with X and his mom bowling?”
