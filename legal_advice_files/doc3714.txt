 I am 19yo from Central New Jersey and take care of my 93yo great grandparents (GGPs) who are in relatively good health with a few bumps in the road. I graduated high school early and I'm not the smartest kid you'll meet but I work full time and devote my two days off and afternoons to fulfilling their every need and command. My mom who has been in and out of my life since birth only became sober and fully active in the family 14 months ago. My GGPs believe in seniority and redemption and second chances blah blah and enable my mentally ill mom and uncle through addiction and sobriety. My mother wants to sell my GPPs house and use that money to buy a house for herself so she has a home after my GGPs pass and wants to accomplish this by using the ruse that its so she can be their full-time caretaker. My mother is an okay caretaker but she's been known to steal money and she is sober from her sixth adventure with drugs. What can I do to protect myself and my great grandparents? Ask me any and all questions I'm at work so I might have left voids If they’re in good mental health there’s probably not much you can do. They’re allowed to do what they want with their money and property. If you think it’s truly necessary, find an attorney and discuss the options of being appointed as power of attorney or guardian of their estate.
