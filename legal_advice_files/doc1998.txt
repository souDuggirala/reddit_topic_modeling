 Today one of the breakers in our apartment blew which leaves us without electricity in our apartment except for the bathroom and a kitchen wall shared with our bathroom. We were able to move our refrigerator to an outlet that works, but it is currently in the middle of our kitchen. We also still have heat so this is not an emergency. This happened today around 4:30pm and I got a hold of our property manager just before 5. He says he will call an electrician first thing tomorrow but that he cannot guarantee that we can get same day service. I asked how long we will be without power and he said he will let us know tomorrow. Our apartment is in a house that is over 100 years old. We have had reoccurring issues with electricity and it's been mention by our property manager that the paneling needs to be updated. This all seems to have been preventable, but at this point we might be without power for days. What rights do we have as tenants (Seattle)
