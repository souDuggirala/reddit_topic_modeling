 Hi r/legaladvice I am a resident at a large apartment complex in Texas affiliated with a public university. My apartment complex recently began to refuse any mail deliveries from Amazon. Residents of the complex were not provided any notification of this change, and are met with hostility and lack of clarification upon contacting apartment management. Mail deliveries from other carriers (USPS, UPS, FedEx) are still allowed within the complex. Are any of our tenant rights being violated with this change? Is my apartment complex allowed to refuse mail deliveries from just one company? I understand amazon is a private company and mail from them may not be protected at the same standard as USPS, but other private delivery services are still accepted. Is there any legal recourse I can pursue against my apartment complex?  Does your lease say anything about this?
