The company is based in DC. That's also where I perform the majority of my work. The company has under 100 employees.   


My company informed me this week that I should anticipate being laid off mid-December because they do not have a project to move me to after my current one ends. I have a stellar record with the company, receiving full salary increases and bonuses each year. This year, instead of giving me a review, they let me know that I'm being let go.   


During a discussion about a potential severance package, HR informed me that they would pay out up to 40 hours of PTO. The problem is, I have nearly 200 hours saved; time I had intended to use around Christmas and to attend military training in the spring. HR was not aware of my current balance and said they would need to discuss how much of the balance they would be willing to pay.   


I'm not sure what to do while I wait for their response. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  [deleted] Since it's common to put company policies in a handbook and also reasonable to expect employees to read the handbook- that's likely in compliance with the law I referenced you to.  [deleted] OP- It appears that in the District of Columbia, [employers are required to pay out PTO balances](https://www.employmentlawhandbook.com/leave-laws/state-leave-laws/district-of-columbia/#1) to their employees. The only exception would be if you signed a document waiving this requirement or (most likely) if your employers company handbook states a different policy.
