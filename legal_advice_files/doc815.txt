 Title says most of it. Do I have any legal recourse? How can I have this removed? Someone is cyber stalking me with an image of when the police took me in. The charges were dropped within hours but the image was posted to a law enforcement website and someone saved it. I have no idea what to do. I worried this could cost me my job. ...You were accused of having sex...and then those charges were dropped?
