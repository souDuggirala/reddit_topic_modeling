 So a friend of mine (we will call him Ray) was recently driving back to school with his girlfriend in Delaware when he got into a road rage incident with an aggressive driver. From what he told me, the other driver was not only aggressively driving around/near him (meaning he cut my friend off, brake checks, etc) but he was trying to force them off of the highway into a retaining wall. During this, the other driver had his window down and was shouting obscenities towards ray and his girlfriend. At this point,Ray deployed a high grade pepper spray into the other drivers car. After this, ray notes going through an EZ pass around 30 miles down the road. Now I'm sure that Ray was egging this guy on so I'm unsure who is truly responsible, but can he be prosecuted for pepper spraying this guy? Is he protected by the law because he felt threatened? What should he do, if anything?  Your friend should call the police and pull off somewhere safe and populated next time. It is pretty much never legal to pepper spray someone operating a vehicle. Yes, pepper spraying someone while they are operating a vehicle ffs is illegal. I can’t believe I have to type this sentence. Tell your friend he’s not Mad Max. If your friend pepper sprayed someone then he needs an attorney. There are so many angles to this situations ranging from why he didnt pull over, why were police not involved in this event, whether pepper spraying a driver of a vehicle was a reasonable reaction. There is way to little information to say one way or another what will happen but having an attorney will make things a lot smoother.
