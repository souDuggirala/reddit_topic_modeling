 Hello Everyone, If this is not the right place to post this please let me know. Sunday afternoon I posted a video on Twitter that has gone viral - currently sitting at 4.5 million views- 95.3k RT's and 322K Likes. Someone (claiming to be) from DailyMail reached out and asked for my permission to share the video - I said they could use it for $150.00 thinking they would tell me to pound sand. However they agreed and said I need to send them an invoice including my routing and account number as well as address and email address. Should I do this? They have a phone number and email address that seem legit. Just not sure what to do. How can i verify that this (and potential future requests) are legit? [removed] Call them up and say you’re not interested in direct deposit (routing number), but instead want a check.  Don’t do it. Whenever a company asks to use a viral video, it’s sketchy. They will pay you but they will make it extremely difficult. Don’t bother
