 Without going into too much detail, a few years ago my brother was on a missing persons report around 2 years ago. They both wanna get it removed, but theyâ€™re not sure how. We live in Florida.  Shouldn't be, but if he doesn't have any other more recent/prominent web presence, it's not surprising it would still be near the top. Alright  The fact that he isn't a missing person anymore may help the case, though. It shouldn't be relevant enough anymore to be brought up in a google search. In addition to what /u/Bobblestring said about asking nicely, you can pay an SEO company to try to bury it underneath other search results. But there's no "right to be forgotten" in the U.S. They'll have to ask whoever posted it to remove it. They won't have to comply, but they may if they ask nicely.
