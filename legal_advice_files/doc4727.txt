 I have a website that allows third party content. In my Terms I of course advise users not to upload copyrighted content. It's a Pinterest situation, except I'm one person without a legal team. Of course I remove content if I receive a DMCA notice (which is rare) within 24h. This does not help, of course, when you get contacted by a well known "copyright troll." The email arrived the day before Thanksgiving so I have not had a chance to discuss this with a lawyer, but will next week. The sum they want for 3 images is a whopping 10k, so I've been Google lawyering out of stress. Anyway, I notice now that the images were added to my website in 2014 and I can somewhat back this up with Google analytics. Additionally, I can see in the registrations they sent me that they registered these images in 2016 even though they were initially published on a stock photo website between 1995-2005. From what I've read, this seems to suggest they are not in fact entitled to statutory damages as they assert. Since 2014, one of those pages has enjoyed a whopping 400 page views, and my website is completely free for users and not even monetized with ads - so even real damages would be minimal, I would think. My question is two-fold: have I understood the law here correctly, and do you think it is possible I can walk away with just taking the images down, or should I expect to pony up something in settlement? If so, do you think it's realistic I could talk them down to $200 per image which I've read is sometimes accepted for "innocent infringement?" Thanks for your thoughts. Did they send you a proper DMCA notice, and did you take it down promptly after receiving it? If so, you're not liable for any damages for third party uploaded content under safe harbor, AFAIK.
