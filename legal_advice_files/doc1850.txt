 My wife sued her ex employer back in end of 2016 for discrimination, unpaid wages and etc. Fast foward today and nothing haa happened yet, and I just received an email from my attorney saying "Previous employer has filed motion to remove person a from the lawsuit and we will have a court hearing in April and Trial is set for July. Deposition date is processing" What does this mean? Thank you in advance for any help. We have been stressing for the past 2 years for the lack of action from our attorney and lack of communication. :( Thank you for the reply. I would ask my attorney if he would pick up the phone or reply to my emails :( You already have an attorney. You should be asking your attorney what this means. If you donâ€™t think the attorney is handling the case properly, you should find a new attorney.
