 My girlfriends mom sent over a form to a different college that expresses an intent to transfer. On this form you need both a parent signature (for who's paying) and a student signature. Her mom signed both the parent and student line. And even if my girlfriend DID want to sign that form, she couldn't as her and her mom are in completely different states. All of this was done without my girlfriends consent. Today, my girlfriend received an email from the transfer school asking for an official transcript to be sent over. If she doesn't send over the transcript, her parents will not continue to pay her current tuition. She doesn't want to switch schools and she only has 1.5 years left until she graduates. Is there anything we can do without getting her parents in serious legal trouble for forging her signature? I hate to say this, but beggars can't be choosers. If she wants parents to foot the bill, she has to toe the line. If you want to be independent, then welcome to paying your own bills. Your girlfriend doesn't have to send the transcript or otherwise participate in this process. And her parents don't have to continue paying her tuition. Probably not. Your girlfriend can report this to the police if she's inclined to do so. Without a loss over the event, it isn't terribly likely anyone with invest too much effort in the matter.
