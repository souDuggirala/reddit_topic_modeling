 First time poster, here. My case is going to be difficult to explain in a few words, but I’m going to try. I own a small business in Colorado, and I had a large office space. At the time, I shared this office with a couple other small businesses that operated out of there during the day and helped me pay the rent. I became friends with a woman who own another small business that would have worked well in our shared space. She had found herself in a bad financial position in her previous location, and myself and the businesses I shared an office with decided to have her open shop in our space. Long story short, our timeline didn’t go as planned, I fronted a lot more money than I had originally planned for the build-out, I asked my other business partners to move out on her behalf, all while she consistently threatened to discontinue working together. Right before we were going to sign a lease together, I gave her an option to see a mediator and sign a contract or to move out; she chose to move out. As I was not able to afford the space on my own, I eventually had to give up the space myself, and my company is now remote for the time being. This weekend, I was served with papers that she is suing me for damages for over $100k; this is absolutely ridiculous as the money she actually invested in the space was no more than $5k, which is even exaggerating. I spent at least twice this, all while continuing to pay the rent and utilities on her behalf. Also, I think the most important detail was that there was no contract. I have a couple of weeks to respond to the complaint, and I’m not sure what the best route is. I am hoping you can help.  I have a meeting with an attorney this week. Just wanted some advice on what to expect and such. Thanks.   $100k This is where you get off reddit and get an attorney. Full stop.
