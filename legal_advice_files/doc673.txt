 I believe my ex isn’t competent enough to take care of the two cats that we co-parented. I have a lifetime of animal experience and just told him what to do/how to help me, but he only feeds, waters, and cleans their box like once a week. He never trims their claws, he doesn’t keep up on their medical, one of the cats has had urinary issues for over a year and he refuses to take her to get treatment, let alone does he have the funds. If i take him to court with this would I have a chance? Are you married? The new law only applies in divorce cases. If not, the animals are no different than furniture and the court will not consider ownership. If you can prove they are yours as opposed to his or joint owned, you can try to sue for the cost of adopting the same breed and age from a shelter if he refuses to allow you to have them back. If they are jointly owed, it is a zero sum matter and not something you can pursue in court. I suspect the best approach is to try to do this civilly and convince him they are better off living with you. But you can not force him to, nor is this a matter the police or courts can assist with.  no we just broke up two weeks ago  He has had them for a year since you broke up? California law recently changed in that "custody" of animals can be considered in divorce cases, but that does not extend to trying to regain possession of them from an ex who has had them for a considerable length of time.
