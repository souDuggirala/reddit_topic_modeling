 My spouse cheated on me and I am looking at getting divorced. No kids. We have already split our assets and she says she would be fine to leave it at that but I am worried she may come after me later as I have a much higher future earnings potential in about 18 months but also near $250k of student loans. Is this possible or if we signed an agreement now stating that future income would NOT be split that I would be sufficiently protecting my future earnings? Bad question to ask Internet, great question to ask your lawyer. Besides the fact that alimony is very unlikely to be awarded in a marriage of very short duration, she is currently in agreement to leave without it. Get divorced ASAP and lock that agreement. There is no coming back for alimony after divorce is final. Get that final and you are done forever.  (Depending on state) if you earned a pension that you would have access to, while married, she can request a portion when you retire. However, this would be in any dissolution settlement. I do not believe she can garnish any future earnings. As a very general rule you are only going to be ordered to pay alimony at most for half the time you were married but obviously different circumstances can come into play. It's going to depend in large part on how much income your spouse sacrificed in order to be married to you like raising kids or managing a home. If neither of those factors are present it's less likely you will be ordered to pay anything.  4 years How long have you been married?
