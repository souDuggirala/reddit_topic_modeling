 Came home today to a destroyed mailbox in front of my house. Looks like a car hit it and ran. I don't have security cameras. Neighbors said they heard a crash, but didn't see a suspect. Is there anything I can do? You can sue the person who did it if you can find them and /or go to your local home improvement store and buy a new one.  Report to the police and file a claim with your homeowner's insurance. Call homeowners insurance and file a claim or go get a new mailbox. You can file a police report but I wouldnt expect anything to come of it unless your neighbors have cameras.
