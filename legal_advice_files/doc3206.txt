 Yesterday I was at Walmart with my mom at the self-checkout lanes. We were sharing a cart and one of my items was trapped under hers, resulting in me not seeing it. After paying for my stuff (around 30$) we went home and I noticed I didn’t pay for one of the items. The item was around 5 dollars and no alarms went off, and no one tried to stop us on our way out. I’m too scared to go back and get in trouble for it and I’m also scared the cops are going to find me.  I mean, if you walk into the police station and confess, then maybe. But my point was that they won't go tearing across town to apprehend somebody who accidentally shoplifted something worth $5. More than 20 yrs ago I accidentally left the grocery store without paying for a huge package of pork chops. With young children in the cart and a load of the once a month grocery run, they were overlooked, but the guilt!!! Geez Obviously 20yrs later, still think about it. I should have donated the same amount of food to he food bank. I guess I still could.  Butt what did your parents tell you to do? The cops are not going to bother with this. You're way overthinking it. Nothing is going to happen. Do not say anything to the store. If it helps you feel better, you could just walk in and put the item back on the shelf, but I guess if you've thrown it away then you can't do that either.  You are giving the police too much credit. Some may just as easily take the easy arrest of someone that admitted taking a product from a store.  Bad advice. Removed.  I wouldn't give this particular bit of advice. This subreddit has seen numerous instances of honest people who tried to make right on an accidental shoplifting, and they found themselves in legal hot water. And Walmart was one of the stores involved. This exact thing happened to me and this is exactly what my therapist told me to do. It helped a lot to be honest.  Lol, calm down. You are 100% fine, cops won't bother searching you down even in the super unlikely event somebody notices, which won't happen because theres no way of knowing. People purposefully steal stuff worth 10× as much and never get caught I've worked at Walmart has we all know this can happen via honest mistake. Most people will bring the item back in pay for it. The store had about $500 in merchandise stolen/taken without paying daily. $5 is nothing. As it was an accident, your conscience should be clear. I think nothing else is necessary. They won't recognize you as the person who took a $5 item. You're fine, IMO I wouldn't sweat over an honest mistake. Make a $5 donation if you feel bad. [removed] Honestly nothing is going to happen, they could care less about a little $5 item. Tons of items get stolen from Walmart each day, they’re not going to pursue anybody. Just forget about it nobody is after you. Loss prevention isn’t even allowed to follow shoplifters out the store, let alone run a full investigation on you. It was an honest mistake don’t beat yourself up about it.  [removed] While I won't deny that a lot of stores might do this, heck even mine might try this, it also depends on who is working at that moment. If I was on duty I would simply thank the person for being honest and throw the item back into go backs, this has happened more than once already, most of my coworkers would do the same as we know mistakes happen. As for store official policy that's more of gray area as there is no real mention of what to do with a return stolen item. In the end of the day however no one will notice a less than $10 item missing until that store's annual inventory and by then it's simply just written off.  [removed] Honest mistake lol if you went out the door and no alarms went off, it was in your cart and not your pockets.  If it makes you feel any better, the cops have better things to do than to hunt down "shoplifters" who accidentally stole five bucks worth of merch.

[removed] You're a missing item on someone's inventory report. Probably one of 20 that happened that day. One or two missing items is nothing to a store, my Walmart wouldn't even bother having someone take inventory until a whole box worth of product goes missing.

Unfortunately, many stores tend to disregard attempts at honesty, use you returning the items as proof you stole, and will still nail you for shoplifting when you goto return it to them. Its happened numerous times in this subreddit. The best thing to do here is to move on, do not try to return the items and continue being a decent person. edit: confusing wording. [removed] [removed]
