 I started working at a pizza shop in September part time, and the place was a mess. Rats were everywhere, shitty management, workers drunk or high off their ass, and the oven kept breaking down. In November their oven broke and it wasn't worth it to repair it so they just shut down without giving me my last 2 weeks of pay. I had one manager there I actually liked who was well aware of me not getting paid and I trusted that he would take care of it for me. Now, 3 months later, I've realized they definitely won't pay me. I have proof of the hours I work and bank statements that do not match up with my hours, any advice you guys? If they've gone out of business then it might be difficult to get your pay, but it's worth filing a wage claim with your state's department of labor to see if they can help.
