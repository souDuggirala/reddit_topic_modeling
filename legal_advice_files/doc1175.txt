 Hi all! I'll make this quick. I live in Kentucky. The local electric company is upgrading an existing pipeline that runs through my yard. They are making use of an existing utility easement (I don't remember seeing it on the deed/plat, but since there is a pipeline there already, I am assuming the easement is there. I plan to call to confirm the details). I was offered compensation for damages. In this case, they are going to remove two trees that I like. They are offering me \~$450 for each tree, but it will cost me much more than that to replace them. How negotiable is this compensation? I assume that they would prefer not to litigate over the easement, so I might have some leverage, but I've not been through this before.
