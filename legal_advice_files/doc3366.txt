 I walked into an NYX a couple of hours ago and completely accidentally pocketed an eyeshadow palette. It was a small NYX in a large mall and I'm dying of the guilt and deathly afraid that I might be recognized on camera. How should I proceed? Should I go back, tell them and pay for it or should I just keep my mouth shut and avoid a legal issue? I've never done anything like this before in my life.  INAL, but if you weren't apprehended or approached, I'd just chalk it up to lesson learned. If you go back you run the risk of overzealous staff or loss prevention trying to make it worse. Just my 2 cents worth. Typically they won't look for you unless you are a repeat offender or art of OCR.
