 Hello Reddit I am trying to get an opinion on if I should dispute a parking ticket I recently received in my apartment complex. It was from parking in the designated area I was supposed to park for after a snowfall of more than two inches. I spoke with my apartment about this and they said the changed the rules on February 1st this year and posted it to every apartment building. Problem is they posted it to the exits of which I do not use as I only enter and exit through our patio door. And the one location that has rules posted that I did see, above our mailboxes, was the old rules. And I checked they are still up currently. As the rules were never given directly to us and we were never contacted through mail, email or phone about a rule change and they still had the old rules posted at the time of my ticketing would it be worth disputing my ticket?
