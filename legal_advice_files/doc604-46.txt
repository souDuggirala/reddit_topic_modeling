I am a student and worked a fair few hours at an open day for my University. 

It was near the end of October and they informed us that we would be paid at the end of November. 

Important to note here: I am an estranged student and have no contact with my family so no financial support from them. I also have a disability that affects my energy levels ( and also muscle pains causing awful handwriting this is Important) therefore can work odd jobs but not permanant ones meaning I rely soley on student finance if there is no odd jobs (agency work or working for the university). I also commute to University and this costs a lot; i can't afford rent near the University. 

The end of november came and I didn't get paid so I checked my bank and I hadn't been paid. I emailed the guy who emailed me the work info and he stated that my information on the pay roll form was wrong (specifically my name was written badly). Now the pay roll form was filled out at the end of the day I worked and checked by staff there to make sure it was all okay. I filled out my first form wrong and explained to staff my handwriting issues so a lady helped me fill in another new form and gave it the okay and i went off home. 

Now the guy said that I will have to wait until the end of December and it is my fault for not filling in the form right. I stated that I should of been contacted (they could of searched my address or any other info in the form to check my name) i also provided my passport and letters to them to verify identity etc. I heard nothing from them suggesting anything was wrong.

Now it was a good hourly rate and a fair few hours and I budgeted to be paid this amount by my next student finance payment which is the beginning of January. I am now not great finance wise and I am very stressed. What can I do about this?
