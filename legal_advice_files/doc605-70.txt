So background story- thought we had a great marriage. 2 weeks ago someone messages me on FB that she‚Äôs been screwing my husband. Didn‚Äôt seem credible, no details, and my husband had to recently fire a whole department due to downsizing. He claimed someone was mad. Next day she messages me more details and now it‚Äôs seeming weird. So I text my husband. Within 3 minutes I get a notification that my FB was used from another location with the zip code of my husband‚Äôs work. I go on and the lady who kept messaged me is suddenly blocked. Husband comes home agitated and acting very strange. His phone is glued to his hand all night, he had a bad day and doesn‚Äôt want to talk about this nonsense. 
So I go on my cell carriers website and find that they have a text messaging app. I installed it on my phone and use his number. Now all of his incoming and outgoing texts are being sent to the app on my phone. He has no idea. In 2 weeks time I have found out that he did screw this girl, he does cocaine on business trips, and he‚Äôs been gambling quite a bit.. That besides the countless lies he regularly tells me apparently. I‚Äôm in the process of finding a lawyer now, but can I admit that I downloaded this app and have been reading his texts to show proof of what‚Äôs going on? Or can I get in trouble legally? I can divorce him without it, but I know he‚Äôs going to try to mess with the custody of our kids. Proof of the cocaine would be nice. I‚Äôm not trying to take them completely from him, I just know he‚Äôs not going to fight fair and I want all of the support I can get.. 
Also not sure if it matters but the 2 cell phones are only in my name. I added him to my plan while we were dating and i haven‚Äôt had a reason to add his name. It‚Äôs paid on a card with his name on it though. This is in FL.@ *Your post has been removed for the following reason(s):*

*Do not reach out to a moderator personally, and do not reply to this message as a comment.* [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] It's probably just Verizon's messenger app. It has a web UI that auto syncs your texts.  Are you both on the same plan and is it paid for with a joint account? I would get a free consult with a lawyer and request all your cell phone records from your phone company if the lawyer gives the okay. That's very good advice. Perhaps you can also share that advice with your husband too. But since you are the decider and rationalizer of who is allowed to use it or not, I guess you won't.  [removed] [removed] [removed] üëçüèª I‚Äôm not telling you the app name or how you could can determine if someone is using it on your phone. A new phone account in your name would solve that issue 100%.  [removed] I see you're doubling down on your bs. Again, great job. Here's some advice for you- lack of self awareness. projection, rationalization etc. are all defense mechanisms and show a very clear lack of self awareness. Also, you come across as being quite nasty. Being cheated on is no excuse to be nasty to others for no reason. And lastly, I asked a legitimate question, your response was way out of line and what caused this.  This is legal advice, I‚Äôm asking for it. You‚Äôre asking for help with making sure your parents aren‚Äôt reading your text messages. Here‚Äôs some advice- if you‚Äôre old enough to get a job, get your own phone account.  [removed] Thank you for this information! IAAL, but not a lawyer in FL.  I am NOT your lawyer, and anything I post in here or elsewhere does NOT and will NOT create an attorney-client relationship, or any other type of relationship, between you and I, or you and any firms I may work for or be employed by.  My posts on your issues in here and anywhere else are NOT, and should not be considered legal advice, but are for informational purposes ONLY.  You need to hire a qualified family law or divorce attorney to receive legal advice and representation on your specific case.

When you hire or discuss your case with an attorney, you should mention that you suspect your husband of having an affair, and are also aware of him doing illegal drugs during the marriage, and suspect he has now begun use or become addicted to additional illegal drugs after the marriage and/or during the affair.

If you're really concerned, you do not necessarily need to mention specifically how you learned of the cocaine use, simply that you suspect it, and that you believe there may be or is likely text message or other digital evidence of it.  That being said, you should really never withhold info regarding your past actions from your lawyer, especially if they ask, no matter how irrelevant you think they may be.  Once you file for divorce, during the discovery phase, your attorney can request any of your husband's text messages, emails, etc., that show any evidence by him of any affairs, illegal drug use, or any other allegations that you make that would be grounds for divorce in FL.

If requested, he and his attorney are required to turn that evidence over in a civil case against him, which a divorce is civil.  If they don't, not only can your husband be held in contempt until he turns the evidence over, and/or have the divorce case negatively impacted in serious ways, his attorney can also be sanctioned if he knows of the evidence's existence and cooperates with your husband with his refusal, including up to losing his law license.

If you do mention how you learned of the cocaine use, though anything is possible and I'm not a FL attorney, I cannot think of any likely realistic scenario where you would be criminally or civilly liable for reading his text messages in the manner you described.  Especially as the phone account is in your name and you were married at the time of your discovery of the messages so there is less of an expectation of privacy.  Also, evidence of his cocaine use would be highly relevant toward his credibility and his safety to act as or ability to parent your children.  Finally, you sharing of your PAST actions (if they were criminal) with your attorney would be privileged information and your attorney cannot share that info without your permission. FL 934.03 prohibits recording of voice *and text* without the consent of all parties.  In FL, interception of a communication (definition includes texts) is only legal with the consent of all parties.  Or in other misc. circumstances, none of which apply here.  

You may *arguably* have his consent given that it's your phone &amp; account he's using, but you certainly don't have hers.  FL specifically prohibits the use of improperly intercepted communications in any action. [deleted] Yes, that's the best way to respond to someone who has rightfully called you out for your immense projection, rationalization, judge mentalness, hypocriticalness,  justifications, and mental gymnastics. Good job on the self awareness there  [removed] Cool story bro One more thought: ask your lawyer about requesting a drug test, assuming that you could pass one as well.

Depending on whether your husband is a chronic or occasional user, the time frame for detection is different. Urine is normally used, but maybe you can get a one time hair test to prove he's been using, then regular urine tests as a condition of visitation or custody, given that the hair test should be positive. 

https://americanaddictioncenters.org/cocaine-treatment/how-long-in-system It sounds like you're being smart about this. 

You can start downloading past bank statements, W2s, sample pay stubs and tax returns so you have some paperwork ready for your attorney once you settle on one.  If your husband has been spending your marital assets on his affairs, that may shift the division of assets a bit. I'm not sure if the same is true for illegal drug use.  Ask your lawyer.  He's getting the money for the cocaine from somewhere.  This isn't for my partner, I've had issues with lack of boundaries with this person before so I merely wanted to know what could be seen. Not that I had to explain that because I don't appreciate being assumed for the reason I was asking. If you do not want to reveal the name of the app, could you at least let me know if iMessages can be seen on this app or just strictlytext messages?  As a side note, I wasn't judging you, I was merely asking so I'm not sure why you felt the need to imply I'm asking this "to keep tabs or for my insecurity" or you felt the need to justify your "need to know what's going on" as if that makes it justifies it rather than "to keep tabs or for insecurities". And I should just ask them if they're reading my texts and they will give the truth? How did "just asking" work for you and would you have told your husband you read his if he had "just asked"? Didn't think so. Your answer is extremely hypocritical  [deleted] I‚Äôm not answering these questions. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs hypocritical or not, but I don‚Äôt feel comfortable giving out info that could allow people to start reading every single text their partner sends out. I had to know what was going on and felt like I had no other options. I wasn‚Äôt reading to keep tabs or for my own insecurities. If you have reason to believe your partner is reading your texts ask them.  [removed] Are you whatever cell phone company she uses? Exactly. 

 Thank you! I‚Äôve never even had a speeding ticket so any wrong doing makes me extremely nervous.. thanks That makes sense. I could have my lawyer recommend hair tests. I‚Äôve never done a drug in my life, so they can test me anytime. I literally have the fake pee in my home right now from when my husband thought he was going to get a drug test. He smokes pot illegally, which I knew and never cared.. I‚Äôm just not sure if I can specify I only care about cocaine, not if he smokes a little pot outside after the kids are sound asleep.. The texts show bragging of cocaine use, so we know he‚Äôs doing it.  [removed] Generally, you can tell your lawyer that you DID commit murder and they have to keep that confidential and still assist you with your defense to the best of their ability.   What you cannot do is tell your lawyer that you are GOING to commit murder and trust that they will not report it.   They are legally and ethically bound to avoid assisting with future crimes (like perjury.  One of the reasons your lawyer may not ask 'did you shoot that guy?' is that they would then be in an ethical dilemma if you later take the stand and deny something you admitted to them.), and to take steps to prevent death or serious bodily harm if they think you intend it.   There are some other iffy areas (child abuse, in states where they may be legally required to act as mandatory reporters, for one) but for some nefariously collected text messages, you should feel quite safe discussing with your lawyer, and they're the only ones who can analyze the entire situation and give you definitive answers both to 'can I use them?' and 'should I use them?' &gt; Proof of the cocaine would be nice

If your attorney says the text messages are admissible, you might ask about having custody or visitation dependent upon a clean drug test. Heck, you may not even need the messages to ask about that.  [removed] I did do the force log out immediately when it happened and changed all of my passwords. He tried to casually bring up that my email password changed and he needed a bill. I just said I was hacked and emailed him what he was looking for. He didn‚Äôt press further... I know exactly where he is but with our joint account he‚Äôs know immediately if I hired a PI. I don‚Äôt have standing cash I could use for this. I did think of surprising him and saying it was because our anniversary was coming up soon..  but honestly I don‚Äôt really want to meet his GF. She knows about me, but she isn‚Äôt the one cheating- he is. 
I did unblock her and just asked her if she had any additional information to prove she was with him. I‚Äôm pretending I‚Äôm not really sure. Apparently my husband dumped her for the new girl so that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs coming clean. Thank you for all of your advice. [removed] NAL. 

&gt;Within 3 minutes I get a notification that my FB was used from another location with the zip code of my husband‚Äôs work. I go on and the lady who kept messaged me is suddenly blocked. 

It sounds like your husband illegally accessed your Facebook account.  This isn't a case of 2 wrongs make a right, so it doesn't excuse you reading his messages, but let your lawyer know anyway in case it becomes useful.

In the meantime, change your Facebook password immediately so your husband can't impersonate you online.  Then force logout all devices to kick him out. Then you can log back in.  Here's a link to instructions on how to do that :

 I can divorce him without it, but I know he‚Äôs going to try to mess with the custody of our kids. Proof of the cocaine would be nice. I‚Äôm not trying to take them completely from him

If he'll be out of town a little longer and you know where to find him, you could try hiring a PI in that location.  If sounds like there's a good chance they could document the cheating. The cocaine will be iffy since most people are smart enough not to do it in public. 

If you unblock the other woman and she mentions cocaine, ask your lawyer if that's enough to subpoena the text records from your phone carrier. *Do not ask her about things you read in their text messages*.  Just let her send you messages that you just keep collecting for now. Don't do anything else until you talk with your lawyer. 

What's your location? 

Look up your state name plus "single party consent".  If you're in a one party consent state, download voice recording and call recording apps and play with them so you're set up to record conversations with your husband in case he slips and confesses. 
 Out of curiosity, what is the app called? I've never heard of such a thing and now I'm curious.  [removed] Thanks. I‚Äôm not sure how and the extent of the confidentiality. I‚Äôve only dealt with lawyers in regard to making a will, and didn‚Äôt want to explain all of this to find out that I was wrong about confidentiality Ok this makes sense. I know there‚Äôs a certain confidentiality but I‚Äôm not exactly clear and I didn‚Äôt want to incriminate myself either. [deleted] The lawyer will advise you on if it's admissible, and confidentiality will almost certainly apply, your lawyer is not going to report you to the police. YOUR lawyer is hired to protect you, not get you in further trouble. I wouldn‚Äôt confess murder, but he probably can‚Äôt report this to the police if you tell him and it is illegal The app is actually used on many android phones as the primary text app. I‚Äôm not backing him into any corner or messing with the kids. He‚Äôs been on a work trip with his GF for the past week and a half. I just want proof of the actual situation at hand when I file. Otherwise I have no real proof of infidelity or the other 100 things he‚Äôs currently doing behind my back.  Hi, you might have noticed this sub is "legaladvice". Stow your opinions, and stow your judgement, she asked a specific question and you implying that she is going to get hurt because of it does not help. You should really tell your lawyer the whole truth. [removed] He does not have a code and we have never been weird about our phones. He‚Äôll regularly tell me to check a text message on his phone if I‚Äôm closer. I found out he‚Äôs really good at keeping people informed of safe times. I guess I don‚Äôt even want to mention it to a lawyer if what I did was illegal.. Illegal or not, I would have had no idea what was actually going on so I‚Äôm glad I did it.. but don‚Äôt want legal repercussions.   You should let your lawyer decide, however, is your husband‚Äôs phone locked? Does he have to use a code to unlock his phone? I‚Äôm not *certain*, but I‚Äôm pretty sure because the phones are in your name and your account that for all intents and purposes, they‚Äôre both your phone and you have every right to it and it‚Äôs contents. 

I know that keeping track of your child‚Äôs phone is legal, it does get weird with another adult though. I would definitely speak to your lawyer about it as well, though. 

Edit: I think I‚Äôm wrong, definitely speak with your lawyer. Here‚Äôs some [info ](https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/personal-injury/types-of-personal-injury-claims/are-your-text-messages-and-images-private.html)I found online, though.
