 According to AT T, the only way to clear IMEI is for the original owner to call. I have no idea who the original owner is.  You could sue the seller in small claims court, that could be your best bet. You can also keep pushing eBay and paypal. Did you pay with a credit card through paypal? Give your card company a call if so  Could this be reported to an insurance company? I’m sure Asurion, or whoever, would like to know if they’re being scammed.  You can report the seller to the police. You can also sue the seller for the value of the phone. Since the seller is a scammer it probably won’t be easy to figure out who they really are. You will need to sue them in the county where they are located. Unfortunately, even if you win you will probably have trouble collecting from someone like this.  It’s clearly a well thought out scam. They’ve found a way to block your recourse, I’d report to ebay the seller, leave a warning to others in the page. Looks like  I've done both. Ebay and paypal say too much time has passed.  Report the seller. They probably do this as an insurance scam. Sell it, wait til its been a good amount if time, report the original IMEI stolen. Pay 200 and get a new $750 phone. Sell it to you for 700 and profit 500. Rinse repeat. Like that. I’d contact the seller if they refuse to remedy, I’d def report and claim fraud. From what I found on the internet, the original owner is trying to get an insurance replacement phone which he can then sell again. Wash and repeat.  Yes, it was listed as new from a top rated seller. He sells literally thousands of phones. It seems to be a relatively common scam, unfortunately. I'll never buy another used/refurbished phone again. I doubt the seller even knows where the phones come from.  Did you buy it sealed off eBay? Sounds like a scam.
