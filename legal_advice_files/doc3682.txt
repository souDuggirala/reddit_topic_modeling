 So I've been extended 2 years already for unpaid restitution. I owe $2100. Can they legally extend me again? If so, how many times? Since you don't want to answer questions that have been asked of you, [here]() is all the information you need.  I was planning on it. But a lot has come up. Finally got to the point that i can. But my discharge date from probation is march 21st 2019. So i can be extended again for failure to pay?  You only owe $2100? Why not just pay it so they don’t just keep extending you? I don’t know how many times but if you don’t pay it I’m sure they can just keep extending you or arresting you. Then the $2100 will just grow even more.   $2100. I think that /r/povertyfinance and /r/personalfinance should also be subs where you should be asking for advice because the fact that you cannot manage to get 2100 in more then 2 years is alarming. (that's assuming that this is all you owe and/or that you didn't pay off a lot of debt during that timeframe). One question that needs answering before somebody can make a serious reply: Have you been making payments/attempts to pay off the debt?
