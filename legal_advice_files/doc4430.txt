  Oh boy, here we go. A bit of backround: 2007: BF and I have child. BF refuses to sign birth certificate because he doesn't want to be held financially responsible for her. 16 year old me is 16 and dumb and to happy about our little family to notice the wrongness there. For the next 5 years bf goes off the hinges and is severely mentally, physically, and sexually abusive. It gets to the point where our daughter is old enough to realize whats happening and begins to defend me. It got to the point where our little 4 year jumped in front of me like a shield and starts screaming and kicking out at him. I realized we needed to get out of there. I talk to a few lawyers and they all advise that I can leave without any custody issues. Cut to the day I'm leaving: I've got two options, I can go to an abuse shelter that is 1 mile away from bf parents house or I can get on a flight to my mom. I chose mom. I called up to my local Police department and the conversation goes as follows. ME: My name is Mykeeetsaa, I reside at (location) my child's name is Mykeeetsaa 2.0 and your about to get call from my BF stating that I kidnapped her. I inform the officer that BF and I are not married, he is not on the Birth Certificate, and there has never been any custody orders in place. I inform P.O that I will be leaving to my mother in SC and that in aprox. 2 hours when BF wakes up, he will call saying that his child was kidnapped. I informed PO that I would be at LAX for the next 9 hours waiting for my plane and I ask PO if I would be stopped and arrested, and if what I'm doing is in fact "kidnapping" PO informs me that no, I am not kidnapping and that they will not pursue any charges against me for leaving the state with her, and that I am free to go. Once I arrive safely to my mom's house in SC I have her call BF to inform him that we arrived and are safe and that he can talk to his daughter whenever he wants. I send him a certified letter with return receipt as advised by an attorney, letting him know where I am and why I felt it was necessary to leave. I then immediately try to establish custody and am told that since I am the only parent listed on the Birth Certificate I already have "Sole Custody" and therefor cannot bring an action to establish custody, unless I wanted child support, which I did not. BF and I continue to talk for over a year, he is rarely concerned with our child and just wants me to come back. Things go sour, like calling me 24 times day while I'm at work or school, threatening to harm my family if I don't return, and so on and so on. We break off direct contact, however he still can call my mom if he wanted to talk to our daughter. Cut to the charges: During that year unbeknownst to me he has also been working custody proceeding's in CA. Here's the kicker though, he never informs me of any of it, not by phone or mail or anything. He then convinces the Family Court judge that he doesn't know where I'm at and is unable to locate me, ALTHOUGH on the very first page of the custody documents he writes in my current address. Somehow the judge never noticed this and allowed him to post a notice of hearing in the CA court house, which since I now live in a Different State is completely wrong and improper. Since I never knew about any of this, I never showed for any hearings and BF got full custody of our child. He then files a complaint with the D. A. saying he hasn't spoken to his child in over 4 years and has no idea where I have taken her, and he cant locate us... blah blah blah. Police arrive at my home at 4 am and arrest me, I'm held for 12 days without an attorney or anything awaiting extradition back to CA. Meanwhile he then tries to fly out while I'm locked up and take custody of our child. My mom thankfully gets involved to stop officers from handing her over to this horrible man who absolutely does not care for her and has not visited her once. CPS gets involved and they take her instead. I finally get to CA and am handed a restraining order against my own child. I can't even speak to her over the phone. I eventually get a hearing in front of the Judge that issued custody and present evidence (certified mail receipt, phone logs, ect.) to him. He is furious and rescinds the order. (Daughter is still in custody of CPS though back in SC. So at this point neither of us parents have custody) D.A. however does not care at all, and still want's to pursue criminal charges. For the next year I have to fly, drive, and bus myself to my Criminal hearing in CA and then back to SC for CPS hearings. Our daughter is put through intensive therapy and is berated with questioning as to what happened and as to whether I "coached " her all these years. At preliminaries the Judge finally agreed to 995 dismissal. I got full custody of my daughter back, but the D.A. appealed the dismissal, and basically flat out lied and hid evidence at the Court of Appeals Oral Argument. What is typically a 30 minute hearing went on for an hour, where a bunch of men got together to deliberate, "Whether or not I was abused enough to warrant a good faith claim for my leaving." I. Kid. You. Not. Cut to right now: They still have 60 days to issue their decision, but based on the audio of the hearing I feel like I already know what it is. This horrible nightmare is going back to trial and I feel like a sitting duck right now, and no one is telling me anything, as to what I should be doing to get prepared for this. You hear so many stories of woman in abusive relationships, and the question always asked "Why didn't she leave sooner?" Well folks this is why. They literally asked whether or not I was abused enough. After I left I did everything right. I never once looked at myself as a victim. I looked at myself as a mother. I imminently got a decent job, got my own car, apartment, got my G.E.D., enrolled myself into college. My daughter had the best care that I could possibly give her. And they took her away with out any reason, and I'm terrified that they will do it again. Since all of this between bail, hiring an attorney, and getting back and fourth from SC to CA I'm in 20k debt, I longer have the means to afford my own place so my daughter and I share 1 room in my mom's apartment, and College is on an indefinite hold. My daughter who was the happiest, most caring person ever, now no longer trusts anybody and hates the world. She is prone to anxiety and over thinks and questions every single little thing that happens in her little world. The only thing I have going for me is a decent job which I will most definitely lose if I have to go back to jail/trial. What can I do to make sure that I don't lose my child, and stop all of this madness? Tl;DR: Boyfriend lied; got custody without my knowledge; lied some more; had me arrested; child taken away; life in ruins; BF doesn't even care about child.

According to my friend who is a law librarian, every CA county has a public law library with access to online research databases and treatise materials. The law librarians there may be able to help. Apologies if you already knew this. Well, that explains a lot. I didn’t see that posted. [removed] [removed] Wait until the perjury charge is resolved before seeking it, because that piece of information is critical to the success of any further cases against him. [removed] If he wrote your address on paper filed by the court, they certifiied them to that address. Doesn’t add up.  NAL but according to [this](http://www.scscourt.org/online_services/transcripts/reporter_transcripts.shtml) website family court proceedings are transcribed she may have to pay a little bit of money for it, but it will be worth it. Note: This is only for a county in CA, not the entirety of CA, so perhaps it's different county to county IANAL! DA is a try hard because he had you extradited. He is “all in” and you will have to be as well. Time to start reaching out to attorneys/networks/non-profits that specialize in this type of legal work because there may be a civil suit at the end of this nightmare if the DA is guilty of malicious prosecution.  Nobody here knows that the only logical response is to wait. Usually the initial consultation with a lawyer is free, and since her only two reasonable choices are do nothing and wait for her attorney and the court, or ask around and see what another attorney might say... I see no harm in exploring every single option. What sort of opinion? Without a ruling is there anything that can actually be done? If the only logical response is "wait" then asking a second lawyer is a good way to waste money. Op better contact ANOTHER attorney just for that matter in addition to the paternity matter. She clearly states that she talked to more than one attorney.  Yeah I'd challenge that, please show me where I got served with legal process informing me of these proceedings. OP mentions in another comment that her ex is friends with the DA.  Also a word of caution, never speak with the other party in a paternity case directly. ALWAYS Communicate via attorneys. This is the sort of nightmare that needs to be taught in high school. Then we have the legal proceedings that are in their own right a nightmare and a half. Also, a word on abuse. Anytime that happens MAKE an appointment with a medical professional to start the document trail. That will prove invaluable if/when things spiral out of control. [removed] [deleted] [removed] [removed] I also am confused. At first i thought it was a mistake for you to leave the state even though you were told it was allright. I guess i am confused because nothing was legally established before you left. Child support, visitation etc. I have a feeling he wants you back is so he won't have to pay child support. The abuse would start all over again. [removed] You have to file against him, you have to get a restraining order and than wait for him to contact you and let him continue digging himself deeper and deeper into a criminal record.  [removed] [removed] The DA is friends with a friend of the BF as stated by LAOP. This is an utterly corrupt situation. Please get in contact with your local YWCA. There are certain YWCAs who offer services to people affected by intimate partner abuse and they may be able to help you.  [removed] OP sounds pretty savvy, to be frank. I’m so confused how he could have had paternity established while also saying that he hadn’t seen your child in 4 years? It contradicts itself - they assumed paternity of a child who had no father on the birth certificate and had not apparently seen the claiming father in years so how did they assume it from you two living together? [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] Are you saying that OP can't get a second opinion while she has an appeals decision pending? That's irresponsible. [removed] [removed] It should be ~~appealable,~~ eligible for vacatur. if OP immediately acted to quash service when she discovered the existence of the order. I sincerely hope she hired the best attorney in town as quickly as she could This is how Alabama law works too. I had a client (social worker) who was not the legal father of his biological child bc the mom was married to another man at the time. She divorced the other guy and married him. She then cheated on him and he was the legal father for a child she had with a man she cheated on him with. I couldn't believe it! [removed] [removed] No, they’re not. They’re a blunt tool used to do delicate work. A lot of bullshit happens, but they’re not a business, nor are they inherently corrupt. My lawyer was also on "just wait". But he made sure to write me a receipt over a full hour of work for every single little email he wrote. It ended up costing me 13k and another lawyer to win a 100% case. If a lawyer says "we'll wait" when it is ABSOLUTELY CLEAR that there is tons of stuff wrong/weird, then GTFO. I can only strongly encourage OP to take this seriously. I often think "I got a lawyer, I'm okay" but you need the lawyer. [removed]  It wasn't unresolved when she left. Read it again. 't even report his abuse to the police. How can you blame the judicial system for your mistakes? Her leaving was not a mistake. She didn't make any mistakes, or if she did, they aren't accounted in the post she made. She has no obligation to report anything to the police. Have you contacted your state representatives? Maybe they can work with CPS at the state level- you can check who your state and local representatives are here: [http://www.ocgov.com/residents/gov/legislative/delegation](http://www.ocgov.com/residents/gov/legislative/delegation).  You might be able to sure the DA for hiding evidence. It is rare that they will get in trouble but if enough people start to complain something will happen. John Oliver has a good segment about defense attorney. Isn’t that breaking the 11th amendment? There is a transcript available in the Orange County Family court of our hearing where the judge admits and apologized for his mistake. So yes I blame the judge, and yes I blame the police officer who told me it was ok to leave and for not I don’t know maybe taking down my information when I told him he would possibly have a kidnapping case on his hands in bout 2 hours. I blame him extensively for dismissing my concerns and not taking me seriously. Also as a side note a quick google search would tell you just how awful and corrupt the Orange County judicial system is.  [removed]  It’s entirely possible that the attorney explained these things, like paternity being presumed based on living together and raising the child together, and OP didn’t really understand the law. It’s entirely possible the lawyer doesn’t want to straight out talk shit about a prominent DA to a client. We are getting the words of the attorney translated through OP, who is stressed and not a lawyer.  [removed] [removed] Did you tell your lawyer?

My ex still had joint legal (and technically physical) custody while on trial for the abduction of our child. The criminal court does not have subject matter jurisdiction to modify custody. Of course, I petitioned to modify custody, and once the family court (finally) learned about the indictment I was immediately given ("temporary") sole legal and physical custody.  I legally had to do those things in order to not violate the law that they are saying I still somehow violated.  [deleted] Yes, they have a mutual friend who introduced them to each other. But of course it’s not something that I can prove so I’m not going to even bother bringing it up.  Right. I just assumed she still had quite a bit going in the family court as well, especially considering CPS is involved.  While not reporting abuse, she DID speak to law enforcement before she left and was told what she was doing was above board. She didn't just flee with no plan. Ga uses juries in family court for division of assets and setting alimony, but not for custody. The kidnapping issue is in criminal court. Paternity/Custody is Family court.  [removed] Fishy as fuck isn't it? I'm bewildered at OP's circumstances. I'm so sorry you're going through all this OP. Your comment is only helpful in that it reveals a lot about your character with your attempt to victim bash a single mother who is fighting the legal system to keep her daughter out of the hands of her abusive father. You don’t know shit about the situation, if the boyfriend may have had police connections, or if he would’ve committed an act of violence as a result of being reported (without being arrested/detained). Fleeing the situation is all she felt that she could do for the betterment of her life and her daughter’s life. That sounds like good parenting to me.  She spoke to law enforcement before she left and was assured that every she was planning was legal and wouldn't cause any issues. Yes, a speaking to a lawyer would have been prudent but you can't act like she just hightailed it out of the state with no checks on what she was doing. I'd like to ask you if you ever filed a police report for abuse or domestic violence. The lack of reports is something that gives your husband a lot of benefits when in court. Something else I'd like to point out, law is something that follows a very logical process. We may not always like the results of some of the decisions made, and you will find that you cannot always get your way. But in the end, and for this you must persevere, you will get some sort of justice. Just, never give up. If the hearing was taken down she may be able to. Problem here is my understanding is the custody proceeding may have taken place in family court. I don't know about CA, but in GA civil proceedings are only taken down if a party hires a court reporter. Actually having the reporter produce and certify the transcript is much more expensive, and (in GA) can only be done by the party that hired the reporter.  I mean, I believe it. Have you by chance listened to the new season of serial? It is very, very different circumstances, but you do get to hear a little behind the scenes between a DA and a defense attorney. Charges were not changed despite ample evidence until the very, very last moment. It was crazy. I agree. It's awful. I still wish I'd just disappeared, though. I don't think he would have pursued, so long as their was no money involved. I'm not a lawyer, but I know there are torts for malicious prosecution, alienation of affection, and (probably most importantly) intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Wait for what? How did the ex establish paternity? Why is the DA pursuing a case that so clearly favors OP? Either we are not getting the full story, or she should get a second opinion. I really don't understand why people don't shop around for attorneys. I'd never hesitate to get a second opinion about a medical issue, so why settle for the opinion of the first lawyer you come across? Not having your and your kids lives ruined by poor representation is worth taking the time to get another opinion. My mom _didn't_ force the money issue through the courts precisely because she was afraid he’d retaliate and she’d lose custody. The downside is we had to grow up in relative poverty and she had to humiliate herself picking up occasional checks (that she had to ask him for and he got to decide how much) taped to his door an hour away. There’s no real winning. I have been awarded legal fees twice. First of all, every time I tell an attorney that, they tell me how rare that is. Even with that award, I am still $50,000 or so in debt because of legal fees. What they are allowed to consider recoup-able attorney fees is pretty damned narrow, especially in the realm of family law. I know OP has more than one case open, and one is criminal. But I also know that getting an award of attorney's fees would provide some relief, but it won't even come close to wiping out her debt. OP states they lived together until the child was 5. In many states that creates a presumption of parentage and financial obligation which will hold up in court absent a paternity test.  [removed] This is accurate, if unfortunate information. It's sad to see people downvoting it because they don't like this inconvenient truth. You have my upvote for posting relevant important information.  [removed] Are legal fees not damages? Not while an appeals decision is pending. I would tell her the exact same thing.

Proceedings can last years, and many times the only answer an attorney can give is "wait" If that's the case, her daughter may be heard by the court..if her lawyer can argue that the kid is of sound mind and articulate. The smarter the kid, the better off she will be (in court) if her daughter can state that she would prefer to live with mom. It doesn't mean dad won't get visitation.

All the phone calls in the world won't change the answer [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] Does your ex have any connection to this DA?  [removed] Yes, court records are public records and she should be able to obtain copies. And of course the DA should have it too. I would have hoped that the judge referred this case to the DA on her own. [removed] [removed] In this case, it seems pretty clear cut. You cannot simultaneously have received a certified letter from someone and claim not to have heard from them, and have phone records showing you talked to the child and claim you didn't. This is as clear cut, and under oath, as you could ask for. [removed] [removed] Because it hardly ever happens. I am aware of several cases where a parent with full custody has moved a child out of state of without repercussions but no sane judge would allow it to go down like this. [removed] OP is also being charged with a felony. So there must be a jury. Thread OP state very clearly that the jury has to make its decision "on the facts that the DA alleges." That means the criminal case. Not a lawyer. It’s common for abusive men (or women) hold a position of power and/or have the ability to pull string with authority or those in power. It’s what allows them to get away with what they do, and gives them the confidence to do it because they feel they will never be found out. People “would never believe they would do something like that” I wonder if there is something like this is in play cause this seems super funky.  Don't beat yourself up. In my case, I wish I'd never filed a paternity action. I tried to do the "right" thing. It would have been better for my son if I hadn't. For my abuser, money issues are a red cape to a bull. He is absolutely incensed that he has to pay any amount of money to support his son, ever, and as a result he has spent exponentially more than he's ever paid in child support to sue me over and over and over. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] Might be time to look for a new attorney. There are juries in some family courts. Section 105.002(c)(1) of the Texas Family Code, for example, allows it. It's just uncommon. [removed] Sounds to me like OP either hasn't given us the entire story, or she needs a different attorney. I find it really hard to believe that the DA would waste their time on a case that's seems so obviously wrong. [removed] [removed] Kidnapping is a criminal charge The likelihood of her getting anything is almost nil, sadly. I am a CPS Caseworker in PA. So when all this initially happened and CA civil proceedings/CPS got involved, did you notify your SC CPS and your attorney? You must have proof of your attorney telling you when you first got to your mom’s notifying him of you of your intentions of staying in the state, let alone the phone bills. That would be easy to prove. [removed] [removed] [removed] That's gonna be an awkward trial. Is there any reason why a judge wouldn't dismiss charges as the state has failed to establish paternity?  [removed] This is a good point. Without the proper documents to even prove paternity there's likely nothing he can do. But there was no need for a custody agreement because there was nothing that establishes him as a parent. No DNA test and he’s not even on the birth certificate - so that gives her sole custody. He may as well be been some random dude off the street claiming parentage. And the DA apparently said, yep that looks about right, and ran with it.   It wouldn’t have prevented exBF from trying it, but if there was a custody agreement on file, it should have popped up with just the tiniest amount of research by DA. Assuming they did any research at all.  [removed] Can she request transcripts to ex-BF’s custody hearing, hoping to see if there was, in fact, perjury? I can’t see it going any other way.  Maybe OP edited her first post. Her child was born in 2007 (when she was 16). The bf is abusive and when child was 4 she started defending OP. OP moved to SC where her mom is.  Can you clarify? If she had established child support, how would that have prevented the BF from doing what he did?  Minor thing, but phone calls and voicemails sometimes are more likely to elicit a response than emails.  [deleted] Please ask the DA to charge your ex-bf with perjury before the court. It's definitely police report time for that. That's a pretty serious crime, and it sounds like the judge's decision made pretty clear that the original complaint order were based on under oath lies. And as others have suggested, please talk to domestic violence support groups.  [removed] Can we establish some things, please? Can you please establish a proper timeline? I don't know if your daughter is 4 or 10-11. That is going to play big in court, if your daughter can state her wishes, a litigant ad litem will be appointed (aka guardian ad litem...lawyer for your kid). Regardless, in court timelines are crucial. I cannot tell what is going on in this disjointed relaying of info you have here. You will need to properly recall, by rote, times/dates of incidents. Committed to memory. [CA family law if your child is of age to speak their mind, the court will weigh the child's opinion due weight](=3042. lawCode=FAM) If you do not have an attorney, google is your friend. You can post on the internet. Time to start reading and researching until such a time that a pro-bono lawyer steps in to help. It sounds like you are in SC (I am so confused, btw), you can always request to appear in CA telephonically. I am so confused... FYI there are no juries in family court; and once you are in the CPS registry, you and your ex will stay there for the next 25 years. I am just...ugh. They can't take your kid away without due reason. They wouldn't hand him over to your ex who claims he has had no relationship with the child for 4 years. It doesn't even have to be your mother caring for her while you were incarcerated. It is any adult you deem as responsible. CPS will investigate an abuse claim, but if the home is warm/clean/food in fridge, and child says they are OK, they are done with maybe a few follow up visits. That is how so many kids die AFTER CPS was called. The agencies are swamped. I am so confused... Just a question if anyone knows the answer: Is it common for someone to maintain full legal custody of a child while also on trial (assuming it gets that far) for kidnapping that same child? Seems weird to prosecute someone in this position.  Someone else has pushed you in this direction already, but I want to further encourage you to reach out to domestic violence shelters in your state. I worked with a DV shelter that had a legal department which provided free and comprehensive legal services to victims for things like custody disputes, divorces, orders of protection, etc. It's very possible a shelter somewhere in your area has a similar program. Those attorneys will be well versed in navigating custody disputes with abusers, and they will understand you and your experience in a way many others may not. I cannot imagine how invalidated and small you must have felt to hear them question whether you were "abused enough." You are strong, you made an incredibly brave move for yourself and your daughter, and I hope so desperately that things start to go your way.  [removed] This is family court. There are no juries in family court. There would be a jury if criminal charges were filed. Can you please clarify? [removed] If OP gets her child back and everything solved in her favor can she sue the ex or the people who worked with her husband and fabricated stuff to take her child? I feel like this is grossly not okay legally and it has caused emotional damage to both her and her child. If it’s possible or winnable I would consider it. Hope everything turns out okay. You need to ask your attorney how he established paternity without a DNA test. This sounds like an egregious mistake that he may not even be aware of.  I absolutely did and the judge immediately revoked his custody once I showed up with evidence. But the criminal D. A. didn’t care and is still trying to pursue criminal charges  I get a sincere feeling we are not getting all the pertinent info. OP, you’ve got a lawyer so you really need to be asking and heeding your lawyer’s advice at every point. You have a birth certificate for child that, according to you, does not have BF signature on it. You also said you have plenty of evidence to show the ‘good faith’ you discuss. I know from experience that custody cases can go haywire and it feels like the whole system is against you, but just remember follow your lawyers advice. CPS will likely order you (and hopefully BF) to take state-approved parenting classes, so again from experience, it will look better if you have begun these before even being told. If CPS tells you to complete XYZ make sure you complete XYZ and of course refrain from ALL illegal substances and keep your home in order because I’m sure CPS has or will conduct home visits.  That sounds extremely funky. Did you contest service ? I didn't know that the Appeal only considers the D.A.'s facts. That is very clarifying. I've been going crazy trying to understand how they can disregard so much evidence from my side. It makes much more sense in the way that you explained it. Thank you.  [removed] The judge made no mistake here, and neither has the appeals court. First, the judge is not responsible for effectuating service; that is the responsibility of the party who brings the suit (the father in this case). The only responsibility of the judge is to, so to speak, rip out the suit by its roots when it comes to his/her attention that service was not properly effectuated. That is what I'm talking about with my proposed federal service agency; having the federal government serve people rather than private parties and sheriffs. Second, the appeals court has to make its decision on the facts that the DA alleges. Only a jury is allowed to consider facts that you allege, because only a jury is allowed to decide what actually happened. There is not a male conspiracy of judges against you, but that said, there may be some problem with the DA, who is elected. That's exactly how it happened. Except the mistake on the judges part was that he never cared to enforce proper rules of service, nothing was mailed to me, and the notice was posted in the wrong court. If the judge would have simply made him mail me notice to the address that he himself listed, or at the very least made him post notice in SC Court, then things would have been different. But the judge was careless and let him get away with it.  I don't think a court would normally assign paternity on a new birth certificate without a DNA test. That's what I'm struggling to understand. That would mean I could petition for paternity for random kids, and when I get a default judgement because I don't follow proper court procedures, have the other parent arrested for kidnapping. That's absolutely bonkers. Yep. I was very dumb and I was trying to be as civil as possible with him and not force things on him that he didn't want. Once CPS got involved though the bare minimum of child support was enforced and still is. It barely covers a week's worth of Taco Bell (her favorite.)  It's pretty clear what happened: OP never established custody because she was the only one on the birth certificate. That works if the father never wants to see the child again, but if that's not the case, at some point there will need to be a hearing in some courtroom to determine what the custody schedule would look like. At some point, if the other party will not show, the judge has no other choice but to put out a warrant so that the other party can explain their side of the story. Mechanically, everything was established through default judgements because the other party never responded. That's actually the biggest change I'd like to see in our legal system: replacing private service with a single federal agency responsible for serving parties to civil actions. It's such a major improvement, and yet it's so technical that no political party would campaign on that issue. He didn't. Paternity was assumed, and apparently that was good enough for them.  But how did he establish paternity to move things that far in the first place?  I can't even wrap my head around how he was able to do that. The Family Court Judge just signed him the rights to do it. Without any questions. He ruled that it was ok to post notice of the hearing in CA and since I never showed up the hearing he just gave him everything that he asked for.  OP, did your lawyer ask how he was able to attempt to establish custody without even having established parentage? I'm VERY sorry that you're going through this. Your biggest mistake was the failure to establish child support. That is the reason that you're currently facing financial difficulties and is the reason why the DA was able to bring charges. That's water under the bridge, but to need you resolve that now. Thank you. I will look into this immediately.  I would contact domestic violence centers both in your local area and where the case has been filed against you and ask for resources. I'm very sorry you are experiencing this. It is often referred to as "domestic violence by proxy." Ask them if they can assign you a DV advocate. Case law research is time consuming and not cheap. You can contact your local law school to see if they have any services that may help It's so complicated that I can't even find proper caselaw. Everything I've found is between married parties or parties with custody orders already in place.  It is very hard to get a response from my attorney, and all he has said is that there is nothing to be done but to wait. I'm losing my mind and I feel like sitting around waiting and doing nothing is wrong.  Your situation is very very complicated. Beyond what we can really give you advice on. Only your attorney can give you proper advice on what to do next Judges at appellate proceedings often make hard arguments not bc they're going to rule that way, but to ensure all bases are covered. What does your lawyer say?
