 Hello! I have a question regarding future right wavier (wavier of a right that has still not occurred - right of future action, right of future set-off, future receivable, etc.). In some legal systems (i.e. Romania) it is considered void to make a wavier of a future right). This is accepted both in legal theory and the case-law as a general rule. There are some provisions in different Acts and Codes that expressly state that the wavier of a future right is void. For example - Civil Procedure Code - "Preliminary waiver of the right of appeal is void". My question is: Is it the wavier of a future right considered void in the US legal system (no specific state)? In particular, is a wavier of a future right valid, when it is made with a contract? For example - upon signing the contract, two parties agree to wave their future right to make a set-off - is such a contact clause void? Or when a party states that they wave their future right to seeks compensation for interest in case of non-performance of a pecuniary obligation. Is the remission of a future obligation considered void in the US legal system? - What does the case-law say? I would also very much appreciate it if someone could also cite case-law or article where I could read more. Thanks! :)
