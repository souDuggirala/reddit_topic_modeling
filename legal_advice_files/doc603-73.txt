I need an advise on what to do. Near my house is a public school. It is government funded and is used for voting sometimes. On this school property is a sign that announces events etc. When referring to the fifth day of the week, they used the word "Thursday" (Thor's day) on this PUBLIC school property. I do not mind the word, but the government should not endorse Norse pagan or Neo-Pagan idea that the fifth day belongs to Thor. What are my options to complain? Thanks  /r/legaladvise is that way ---&gt;
