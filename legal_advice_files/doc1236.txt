 I'm trying to get my deposit back. I've contacted the apartment managers multiple times, i feel like we've hardly made any progress. I told them that i was aware of some Texas laws - ยง92.103 , ยง92.104, ยง92.106, ยง92.109. When she heard that she was very combative. Saying "she's aware of the codes." She was suppose to call me yesterday (1-21) but, she never did. So i started doing some research and i saw that i should send a certified letter - A security deposit demand letter. So i sent one while i was at work today. - Was i right to do this? I also called her today(1-22) to ask what the progress was. Again she had no information, she kept telling me that she didn't have any authority, that her boss handles that. Conveniently her boss is always out. She said the same thing on Friday (1-18). When we spoke on Friday (1-18) she had mentioned that all she saw was the carpet had some damages and had to be replaced. I never saw a bill for this. Now today (1-22) she's saying the paint was all messed up and they had to repaint it. When we left the apartment we tried to touch it up, but the color we chose was a little to light. I had let the manager know and she had told me that they re-paint the apartments anyways and not to worry about it. The repaint cost is $180. I have no idea how much the carpet cost is. I don't really want to go to court, i have a feeling they're trying to keep my money. I talked to my new apartment managers and they told me that they're notorious for taking people's deposits. The company I'm dealing with is Lincoln Property Company. What can i do?
