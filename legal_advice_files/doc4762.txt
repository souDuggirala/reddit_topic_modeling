 So I recently purchased a new phone from an AT T store and have been a customer for going on 25 years (since the days of singular). While going through the transaction I was told a law enforcement discount would be applied seeing as my husband works in the field, even though the account is under my name. I was also told that because of my status as a long time and consistently paying customer, the activation fee of the new purchase would be waved. Well what do yah know when I get my bill neither of those two things seem true. Multiple phone calls have been made and apparently I was just outright lied to by the AT T staff when I made the purchase, and am now locked in to a 30 month plan paying incredibly more than I was promised. Is this just a case of buyer beware? Or is there something I can actually do about it? Came here to say this, usually 2-3 billing cycles before a discount will appear, and they may have waived a fee, but that could mean an account credit after x number of cycles. It's a 25% discount I believe How much money are we talking about? How long has it been? Typically when I get the military discount the first bill doesnâ€™t reflect it, but the subsequent bills do and I get credited the amount for the first month on the second bill.  What did the contract you signed say?
