 I own land near Cloverdale New Mexico along the US/Mexico border, what are my options for fighting eminent domain to keep my land? Even if I cant stop it, how many years can I drag it out in court to keep it as long as possible? If this is about the border wall, you may actually want to contact Cards Against Humanity to ask for their lawyer's info. This is an organization that bought up quite a bit of this land and then gifted tiny plots to different people. Hundreds of people all over the US own a foot of land around the border. This wouldn't stop the wall, but it will be a headache.  Thanks I spoke with some attorneys Friday. It does seem like I will be paying for the defense out of my own pocket which I have decided to do. It also seems like eventually the government will take it but an attorney I spoke with today from North Texas said he thinks he could drag it out 30 years especially if its related to the border wall, everyone else I've spoke with said a lower figure some as low as only 1 year until legally it's not mine. I'm hoping to hang on to it as long as possible if not keep it. You can delay the process in the courts. Ultimately the odds are far in favor of the government getting the land, and you won't be reimbursed for legal fees. If the purpose of the taking is for some private interest, you may be able to fight it. For a public interest (which, unfortunately, includes use of the land by border patrol), what you're doing is haggling over the price. Either way, you need an attorney. Hell, even if you planned on cooperating fully, you need an attorney: eminent domain takings almost always lowball the initial offer pretty badly. You probably wont win an eminent domain case but if you want to spend money fighting, get a lawyer.
