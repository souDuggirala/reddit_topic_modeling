 She’s been with a preschool 6 years until today. She was let go “for leaving a child unattended”. It was her second offense in all this time. She was promised a scholarship for our child once she’s born. It was worth $800 a month. They recently came under new management and now she’s fired so they don’t have to honor the promise. I’m not sure if there’s a law about firing pregnant women or if there’s a way to prove the alternative motive. I hope this post was clear enough.  You did not indicate if she actually left a child unattended or not. Your language seems to imply she did. If so, she is what we like to call "SOL" and should file for unemployment. Only if she was let go for no apparent reasons could we even legitimately consider discriminatory or retaliatory firing. Being pregnant doesn't give you a free pass at work. She committed an offense, a second one at that, and was let go because of it.  Do you dispute that she left the child unattended, or that this is her second offense? Does the company generally terminate for second offenses? If she was fired for being pregnant it would be illegal. Since she was fired for poor performance and just happened to be pregnant, it's legal. [removed] She was fired for poor performance. She should file for unemployment.
