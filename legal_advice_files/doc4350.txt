 Hey everybody! I recently got a new job that only allows payment via direct deposit which at first seemed neat because I usually forgot to set that up at most jobs. Also it usually came a day early which was really cool. This payday came and went yesterday and I received nothing. I reached out to a co worker and she let me know that it usual practice for our boss not to pay us until the following Monday. At first I thought this was illegal and looked up something vaguely but upon further inspection I discovered Utah Code 34-28-3 which stated her legal requirement to pay us on the day preceding if a payday shall fall on a weekend or holiday. Who should I go to if I wanted to report this? And should I? That what I thought at first but this particular boss is very shady, I work for a meal service and sometimes she has instructed us to break traffic law as in order to speed up or route time and other things of that nature, it makes me think what other shady shit is going on  Ehh, wait to see if you get paid Monday. If you do, just have a chat with your boss about payday. If you don't get paid Monday, I'd be more inclined to escalate (but still inquire with management first). No need to blow everything up right now, otherwise your boss is going to put you under a microscope here on out. If it can be cleared up with a simple meeting, there's no reason to go nuclear. Sounds like your boss just doesn't know the law.
