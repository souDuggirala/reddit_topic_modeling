I bought 800 dollars worth of Christmas presents.  DHL said they delivered the package to me and got a signature at 4:03 pm.  Not only is the signature wrong (its just a big X), but I have video cameras in the front and back of my house.  The delivery driver never came by!  They opened up a trace on the package and their conclusion is 'they delivered it to me at 4:03 pm and the driver got a signature from a lady and consider the matter closed'.  Either the delivery driver stole my package or DHL delivered to the wrong house and does not care to investigate any further.  I recorded all my calls with them.  Can I take them to small claims court with the customer service recordings, my security camera footage and sue them for the cost of my package + any legal fees? [removed] Your recourse is with the vendor you bought the gifts from. You don’t have a contract with DHL, they do. It’s the vendor’s job to make sure your order gets to you. Contact them and ask how to proceed.
