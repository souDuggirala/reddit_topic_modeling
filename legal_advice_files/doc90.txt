 I have an arrest warrant out for domestic violence charges in colorado. Right now they are 3 misdemeanor charges. How will this affect me if I was never to be in colorado again? For example will a cop in another state (who has pulled me over) arrest me for this warrant and throw me in jail while they figure out extradition with colorado? I've read that they won't extradite unless it is a felony, but being that this is a misdemeanor violent warrant, will they still arrest me and hold me for a few days? Or will they simply let me go. Also, will this show up on any background checks or hinder me from getting a job, renewing license, buying house, etc? Or do those background checks only show convictions and arrests? Thank you There is no future in ignoring an arrest warrant merely because its in another state. Yes. Upon contact with law enforcement you could be arrested while they sort out whether or not Colorado wants to extradite you. And yes, the warrant could appear on background checks and affect anything that depends on one. You should handle your warrant.
