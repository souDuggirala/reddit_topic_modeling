 Without giving to much information away, someone I know is disabled and goes to the VA. For years they have been having some issues. The VA was just giving him pain meds and stuff and telling him he was fine. The guy finally went to and off campus Doctor and they saw he had high blood pressure. Dangerously high. The Doctor looked at his VA records and saw that the VA recorded this high blood pressure for many years but never mentioned it to the patient. He now has hypertension and some heart issues related to it. Is that considered malpractice?  NAL but a medical provider. Just a FYI the VA has their own criteria on this and diabetes that don’t jive with the medical standards outside the VA. You need a lawyer to go through the chart and medications. The VA commonly uses medications for diseases we don’t use as first line treatment.  [removed] Malpractice of any kind is very fact specific and it is unfortunately beyond the scope of this subreddit. If this is a medical question, it is highly recommended to speak with a medical malpractice attorney; your state's bar may be able to refer you to one. They typically work on contingency, meaning there is little up front cost to you. Similarly, consultations are typically free. It wouldn't hurt to meet with one, have them look over your info, and go from there. If this is a question about legal malpractice, you should seek the advice of a second unrelated attorney and/or report the matter to your state bar association" I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
