Long story short, I've subletted a place that ended up being an illegal sublet and after living there for two months the original leaseholder tried to kick me out. They have accepted three months worth of rent and all utilities were paid, and after locking me out demanded more money in order for me to retrieve my belongings, which also included valuables and important documents. As I opposed this demand, the situation escalated. I did regain access to the apartment with the help of the police, and was told by them that it was my right to stay in the apartment, and to start looking for another accommodation as soon as possible. 

Now, the management company, after royally screwing up (they did allow and perform the illegal lockout, allowed a stranger into the apartment who was instructed by the leaseholder to remove and destroy my belongings- if you are wondering, some stuff did end up in the trash and the intruder ate all my chocolate. Ultimately management was not cooperative even when the situation was clear and police got involved), is casually asking when I will leave (not in a threatening way, for what it's worth). They have told me that they'll go after the leaseholder for breach of contract, but that there will be no repercussions for me. 

I intend to leave the apartment by the end of the month (original lease was up in December anyway), but I have not communicated it just yet, as I need some time to process what has happened and consider my options.

The question is: 

\- By telling the management company when I will give back the keys, am I giving up any of my rights? 

They seem very keen on knowing exactly when I'll be out. For safety reasons, I do not want anyone to enter the apartment while I'm still there, unless it's an emergency.

Thank you in advance!
