 On September 22nd I dropped a car off, asking to get "A quote for all things needed to pass state inspection". Fast forward a couple of weeks, and I can't get ahold of anyone on the phone. I go in, and the owner tells me "We are waiting on a part". I asked him what he was doing, and he gave me a quick rundown and the price, which seemed pretty good. I just asked him to call me when it was done. Over the last 2 months I have been given the runaround. I have made 37 calls so far (of which 4 were answered), and never received one from their shop. Each time I've gotten in touch with them on the phone or in person, I get told "Oh it will be ready tomorrow, we'll call you". I am going in later today, and I just want my car back regardless. My concerns are: 1. Can I just go take it or is that theft? 2. I never provided any actual approval for any work to be done. 3. I never received an estimate, so he could in theory charge me whatever he want if I'm a dick about it. 4. If it is some extravagant cost (as some online reviews have suggested), do I have any recourse? I just wanted some advice on how to deal with this situation. I'm no mechanic, but this seems pretty abnormal. Thanks in advance.  This is what I did. Problem is, it's in the back of his lot blocked in by several other vehicles that he insists are not running. Says we will have to wait for a tow truck to move another vehicle (large box truck) before I can take it.  The only work you have supposedly agreed to is labor related to determining what is needed to pass inspection. If that is the case why are they waiting on a part? Go in and insist you are taking your vehicle today, even if you have to call for a tow to another mechanic, do not leave it there. You will likely have to pay for services already performed. If you pay, there should be no reason they don't release it to you....but don't just go and drive it off the lot without a proper convo.
