 First off my assault weapon and silencer are legal. With the spike in mass shootings, I decided it would be best to turn in my AR15 to the police, I stated that I would be at the station at 1:30 pm. I was about to follow through with this, until a friend of mine convinced me to sell the gun to him, and to keep the silencer for hunting. I agreed to this, and we’re going to find a gun store willing to run a background check on him. I have yet to tell the police that I changed my mind, but they keep calling as if I’m now obligated to surrender the gun. Would continuing to ignore the phone calls lead to me getting into legal trouble, and what do I say to them? The police are probably thinking that anyone who thinks that turning in a firearm to the police will make society safer has some reason to think that they are a threat to themselves or others, so they're rightly concerned. Do you not trust yourself with the weapon? Why? Are you afraid you might go off the rails? Are you having intrusive thoughts? Has someone in your household given you reason to fear that they might misuse your firearm? These are all questions which the police are likely asking themselves. Tell them that you've just changed your mind and are selling it instead. Don't answer any other questions. Don't agree to have them just come check things out. Don't tell them who you're selling to. No they would call it a wellness check. Their concern would be you were unstable and are still unable and a danger. You haven't broken any laws. Just tell them you change your mind. You did not make an irrevocable promise to the police to turn in your gun. To arrest me?? Tell them you changed your mind. If you keep ignoring them they will eventually come to your house.
