 The app Whatsapp is basically the most used messenger around europe afaik and im really unsure now. In my knowledge it doesnt matter if you use pictures you dont have rights of(which is basically everything that isnt made by you afaik) as profile pictures. Is that a thing? Im pretty sure thats bs. But nowadays everything is in a gray zone it seems. This is my first post so i hope i did this right. Have a nice day. Yes What's your actual question? If it matters if you use a profile pic that you don't own the copyright to?
