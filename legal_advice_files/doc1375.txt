 Hi! I work for a Michigan company, however located in Tennessee. As technically I am an “independent contractor,” but because of my title (Regional Manager) and my pay,( $400/store, 4.15% total sales per month) I’m treated as an employee, although the majority of my income is based on performance and commission providing services. We have a so called “mandatory meeting” that takes place out of state, 80% of stylists that are going are strictly commission, which means they won’t get reimbursed for time gone, no services equals no money. This i know is illegal. The company pays for our flight hotel and food for this meeting, however is stating that travel from your home to the airport, from the airport to the hotel, from the hotel back to the airport and back to your home will not be provided. Is it legal for them to hold this mandatory meeting, without pay, with travel expenses not provided? (From the airport to hotel and back would roughly be $100) Sorry this is jumbled, on mobile in a rush. Any further questions will be answered.  As a 1099 it's totally legal since per the IRS business expenses can be deducted; even in the case of some W2s. There was a suit years ago about the legality of mandatory meetings and such but the combination of being 1099 and most states being 'at will' employment the companies won. In my opinion it was a case of the ones with the most money won. I am Both, majority of others 1099  Are you a W2 or 1099?
