 I’m really unsure what to do I got caught going 94km/h in a 60km/h zone in Toronto. The cop caught me on a motorcycle. He was sitting at the end of a sideroad with a radar gun which he showed me that said 94km/h. I apologized and even cried and he still wrote the ticket for 259$. It’s not the ticket I’m worried about it’s the demerit points. I already have 3 on my licence from a speeding ticket a year and a half ago. If I plead guilty to this ticket and pay the fine it’s another 3 or 4 points on my license which I don’t want. I’m going to mail the ticket back and plead not guilty and ask for a trial. I’m really nervous I’ve never been to court in my life and I’ve never tried to fight a ticket. I just don’t want any more points on my license. Do you think there’s a chance of winning this or getting the points taken off the ticket? Even though the cop literally caught me on a radar gun? Any advice is appreciated thanks !!  Retain a lawyer and let them do the talking for you if you'd like to minimize the impact of this second ticket. I haven’t gotten a ticket in a year and a half because I learned my lesson the first time.. I just happened to be speeding this one day and ended up getting caught. Relax. Stop speeding: you are a habitual speeder, and quite frankly, the reason why demerit points are used - to deter people that drive like you do. They are meant to make your life harder until you stop speeding.. so stop speeding, or your life will get much harder. Retain a traffic attorney and let them do the talking. If he has the reports from the gun stating you were going 34 over, nah it’s not likely. If you don’t want any more demerits, stop speeding.
