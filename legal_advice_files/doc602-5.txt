I currently live in Wisconsin. My mom lives in Louisiana, where the the lease was signed. 

I’m only 25 and I’ve never been sued so I have no life experience to lean on, and my family/friends don’t have great advice either.

My mom needed a place to stay and she has horrible credit, so I cosigned a place for her. She promised she’d pay rent on time, etc. I was going on faith she’d hold up her end of the deal. She finished the lease and moved out of the place July 1st of this year. I thought everything was fine.

Today, my mom was served papers and she’s being sued for thousands of dollars in water damage and missed rent by her ex-landlord. I’m named as an additional defendant. My mom says she paid all the rent on time, but I honestly feel I can’t trust anything my mom is telling me. I know she doesn’t have the money to pay what they’re asking for, and I don’t have it either.

Should I get my own attorney or use the same one my mom is using? I’ve lived in a different state than my mom the entire time she was in that place but I’m guessing that probably doesn’t matter, right? Am I in any danger of my mom somehow turning this against me or being forced to pay the amount in full?

Thanks in advance

 Own lawyer. Definitely. Now. 

I understand you wanting to help, but you are liable. So get a lawyer. They will proceed to request evidence of the damage, etc. Your lawyer will need proof your mom dud pay. If she gives an excuse, you know she didn't.  But start with a lawyer. [deleted] You cosigned the lease, so that made you just as responsible as your mother.

I would suggest getting your own lawyer to look out for your interests.
