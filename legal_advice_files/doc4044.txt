 I've recently come into more money than I was making before, and I would easily be able to pay what I owe them by January 23rd. I called them up and they said that they couldn't return the amount they had taken the week before, but they could remove the levy until January 23rd and they would put it back on if I hadn't paid it in full by then. They were very explicit, but I did not think to record the conversation. I check my balance this morning and everything has been removed by the Arizona Dept of Revenue. They're closed today so I can't call or go in. Am I even going to be able to get them to reverse this?
