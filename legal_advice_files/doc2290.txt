 my wife's got a divorce and it was said in the divorce that her ex will get the house and the debt from the credit cards he accrued. He is not paying the credit cards which are in my wifes name which is killing her credit. she is constantly getting calls and having to hound him to pay. the house is also still joint with her name on it, and she is getting notices saying he isn't pay that either. he has paid the bills for a while, but just stops every once and a while and now its several months and creditors hounding her. What can we do to make him pay? do we need a lawyer? The credit card company is not a party to the divorce decree; their contract is with your wife. Your wife needs to pay down her debt to protect her credit and then file for contempt. She may be able to file a partition suit to get the house sold, since she didn't have it put in the divorce decree that the house be sold and the proceeds split (which is a huge mistake a lot of people make). She can file a motion in the divorce case to hold him in contempt of court for violating the order.
