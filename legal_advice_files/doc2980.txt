 Hi legaladvice, My court date with my old landlord is fast approaching. Instead of fighting I decided to pay the $1100 for repairs and move on. I have emails proving they said if I paid the money they would let it go and I have been fully paid up for weeks now. Apparently they have to go to court to request it be dismissed. I emailed with them today and they agree that I'm paid up and plan to continue to go ahead and dismiss the case, so this isn't an issue. I now live 6 hours away and I'm supposed to be working on that day so I would rather not drive just to be there for 5 minutes if I dont need to be. My question is: do I need to show up in court for this just to be dismissed, or will that be considered "failure to appear"? I just want to stay home and work and move on with my life. Thanks again. Do not miss the court date. What if your landlord fails to tell them that you paid already? Then you'll end up with a judgement against you.
