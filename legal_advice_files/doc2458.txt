 I'm beyond thankful the apartment complex didn't burn down. However, while smoking weed, my roommate started a fire on accident while I was at work. A $200 futon and 2 large rugs costing $150 each were 50% burned or more. A coffee table and playstation controller were also ruined. The fact that the apartment complex didn't burn down is a miracle. The carpets are also burned in several places in our living room. What action, if any, is possible? You might also pull up the damaged carpets to see if the flooring underneath is damaged. Your roommate would also be responsible for that, but it will likely come out of your security deposit and you may have to fight him over that. (You may also end up liable if any floor damage exceeds the security deposit.) Did you have renter's insurance? If so, file a claim with them. If not, always get it in the future and you'll have to sue your roommate this time. You can take your roommate to small claims for the fair market value of the goods he damaged. For things like the futon and the rugs, that'd be their depreciated value based on their age (which may be as low as "nothing at all" - estimate it based on what you'd pay at a used furniture room for items of the same age). You can also include whatever you end up paying your landlord as a result of the damage to the carpet. Can your pothead roommate afford to pay you back, or does he have a job with sufficient (and steady-enough) income that you could garnish some?
