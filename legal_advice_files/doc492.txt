 I'm male, 20 years old, and a college student. I live in Florida. I'm considered to be an independent student but I'm not sure if I would classify as someone who would be able to apply for scholarships for ex-foster youth. I was initially removed from my biological mother's custody and placed temporarily with my grandmother. Things went south with my mom and it led to my maternal grandmother having permanent guardianship over myself and my sibling. I don't have to pay tuition in the state because of this but I couldn't find a cut and clear separation between someone being under the legal guardianship of a relative and other situations where a minor is removed from the custody of their biological parents. I'm here in hopes that someone from the r/legaladvice community will be able to help me get a better understanding of this.  Okay. I'll make sure to also email the people over the scholarship and ask if whether or not I'm applicable. You should likely check the terms of any specific scholarship to which you apply to decide if kinship placement qualifies for their program.
