 Hi guys. I was recently hit by a car in Ontario and I'm a little confused about filing the insurance claim. Some facts: -I was a pedestrian, crossing the street where and when I was supposed to -I was severely injured (required surgery) -I will soon need physiotherapy not covered by OHIP -the injury is causing me to miss work, as my work requires the use of my hands -i was hit while leaving work, on the road next to the building. My boss told me she is trying to make sure it counts as a "workplace accident" -I have the insurance information of the guy who hit me -I have kept receipts for costs incurred by the accident (cab fare, meds, etc) -I have a police report, a case number, and the officer has informed me the driver has been "charged under the highway traffic act" It seems like the next step is to hire a lawyer and make an insurance claim, but this is where I'm lost. How do I find a lawyer for this? What should I expect to pay them? Is there some kind of ticking clock I should be aware of? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. You don't "file a claim". Ontario is not a no-fault jurisdiction. You need to find a personal injury lawyer ASAP. Before you go, document everything that has happened to you, get your related medical records (you have a right to copies in Ontario) and so on. The lawyer will then contact the insurance company. In terms of finding a lawyer the best way is through a reference, especially another lawyer. For example if you used a lawyer for something in the past. Otherwise as friends and acquaintances. Failing that, Google. I believe there is a 2 year limit on civil claims but you want to act as soon as possible in order to start the process and ensure that all the documents,etc., are available. Personal injury lawyer is what you need
