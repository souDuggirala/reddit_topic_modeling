 I understand that, as an owner of a multi-member LLC, you typically have the option of getting paid via salary or via draw, or maybe both, and that those options have different tax implications. What's not clear to me is what happens when non-members, i.e. employees, enter the fold. Can we still do draws for the owners and salaries for the employees? Or do you have to move everyone to salary at that point? Can someone ELI5 me on how this works in Washington State? Thanks.
