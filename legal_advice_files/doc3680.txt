 I attend a New York City public school. I’ve noticed that my school does not serve kosher or halal food. Should they be serving? I know that in federal prisons, they serve such meals. If both my school and prisons are federally funded, why does one serve religious meals and the other does not?  Also, serving kosher food is harder than it sounds. If you’re going to call something kosher in that setting (and I assume it’s the same with halal), it has to be prepared in a kosher kitchen, with kosher tools. There can’t be cross contamination from the non-kosher side. It’s more than just taking pork and shellfish off the menu and not mixing meat and dairy.  Because unlike a prisoner, you can bring your own lunch. Has anyone requested they serve kosher food? They aren't required to beyond offering a reasonable alternative like bringing your own lunch, but if there is an actual demand they would consider adding the option. Well it is certainly much harder to bring your own lunch to prison with you. Do you actually need a kosher or halal meal? Because in one you can’t pack your own lunch
