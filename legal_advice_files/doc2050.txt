 USA : I had to get a couple MRI’s last year that resulted in a hefty bill and my liability after insurance is 3200. The hospital ended up sending the debt to collections recently. When they called I asked them if they have reported this to the credit bureaus? “No”. If they are planning to report it in the future? “No. But you still have to pay”. Stupid question, but if this is not going to affect my credit, what happens if I dont pay?  The fact that the debt is not reported on your credit report does not mean the hospital will not or cannot take other steps to attempt to collect the debt.  The hospital said they don't report, the debt collection agency didn't. The debt is sold, you're sued by the holding company, they win, you have to pay or your wages get garnished.
