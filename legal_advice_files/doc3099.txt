 Hello, brother-in-law was rear ended in the freeway resulting in a total loss. He switched lanes then was hit from behind a couple of seconds later. There were two witnesses that pulled over and claimed the other car was traveling way too fast and didn't slow down hitting my brother-in-law's car at high impact. Their insurance is refusing to accept liability, vehicle is only worth $3,500-4,000. What is the procedure for small claims court? Does the other party's insurance no longer become involved? Surely, those two witnesses will voluntarily testify in favor of the car that was rear-ended. The person who hit the car was driving a company car so their company would be on the hook for the charges. What would be chances of winning this case?  Yeah apparently he drives it all the time and caught up with him in the end, very stupid the lot of them. What if they serve the company/person and they don’t show up to court, will the judge automatically rule in the owner of the cars favor?  And the vehicle owner gave permission to your BIL to dive the car knowing full well he wasn't covered under the insurance? A lot of times insurance stays with the vehicle so make sure the owner double checks. Google small claims and your county. The owner of the vehicle basically files paperwork with the court, pay a small filing fee, pay a fee to have this person served, then show up to court. You will then work to get payment. I'd wager this person's insurance company will either settle or represent him in court. He was driving a vehicle that did not list him in the insurance.  Contact your insurance, that’s what you pay them for.
