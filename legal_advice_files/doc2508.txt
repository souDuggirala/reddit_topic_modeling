 She was walking into the school to attend a musical being out on by her nephew’s class. There is some displacement with the concrete and the tip of her shoe clipped the displaced piece and she fell forward, threw her arms up to protect her face, and broke both of her Elbows upon impact. We have taken pictures of the fall sight and are keeping all medical bills from the incident. What other actions should we be taking? Is there paperwork from the school we should seek out or should we write a letter to the school district about what happened? She is a self employed massage therapist so we feel like something should be done since this will most likely effect the future of her business. Thank you for your help! As others have said personal injury lawyer would be best to help here. That being said a difference in height is often allowed and does not constitute negligence in of itself. There may also be issues if it's only slightly out and the size of the campus. But again pi lawyer will help navigate these hoops. Personal injury can facilitate a claim on the school’s liability insurance.  Get a personal injury lawyer. You should be able to find one willing to work on a contingency if there's merit to your case. They will likely work towards a settlement with the property owners insurance.
