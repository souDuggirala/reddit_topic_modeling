I don’t want to included unnecessary details so to make a long story short my ex and I lived in an apartment and the landlord sues is for rent. The case was dismissed (10,000) except for the most recent month 650. 

It’s been about 5 years my ex texted me stating she was having her paychecks garnished and wants me to pay for half. Mine are not being garnished and it appears the total amount 650 is showing as her debt with my last name. We are lesbians and never married. 

I am not unreasonable and would be happy to help but after this apartment my Aunt rented to us. She let us get settled and was out of town for half of the year. The whole time my ex did not work and I was trying my best to pay the monthly rent buy falling short. Now she moved out and I live there by myself. My aunt wants her past due rent and my ex completely ghosted when it came up. My aunt even took my ex to court but lost. Now my Aunt has hired a new attorney and because of the total debt will be taking her back to non small claims court. I helped my aunt track my ex down and they refused service when they attempted to serve her because she looks like a man and they didn’t even ask when she said no one lives here by that name. I feel awful and I have been diligently paying my half of this debt back to my Aunt. 

I am unsure of what I need to do to prepare. She owes me a ton of money over the years (12) but I let it go because I just couldn’t have her in my house with her drug use. She didn’t leave when we broke up because I figured legally she was on the lease and I wouldn’t have a foot to stand on. If she takes me to small claims and gets away with not paying my Aunt back I’m gonna lose my mind. She usually does get away with stuff like this. She just texted me asking when I can pay on the 650 that is coming out of her checks.
