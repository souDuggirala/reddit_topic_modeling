 My dad had his third stroke last week and is now paralyzed and unable to speak. He is still at the hospital and his wife is making all of his medical decisions and is pushing for home care. The thing is, she is physically and verbally abusive, controls his finances, makes him feel guilty for receiving medical help and for spending "her money" on medication (so he doesn't take any, hence him being on his third stroke), doesn't let him leave the house or see his friends, forces him to work when it takes a lot of mental effort to do anything (he was urged to take it easy after his FIRST stroke), and so on. I do not want my dad to be under her care at home. He might have an aide and physical therapist, but his quality of life will not be very good. He would be spending the rest of his life in an abusive situation that is made worse by his inability to communicate and move. Also, his wife could still be physically violent and continue to berate him behind closed doors. How do I get a say in his case? I think he would be better off being cared for at a rehabilitation center. I am estranged from his wife after she tried to kill me, so at least I'll be able to visit him at a rehab center since he's not at her house. Do I tell his doctors? I am only his emergency contant and nothing more. Will they believe me without much proof? I have two domestic violence incident reports. Do I call Adult Protective Services? If he ends up receiving care that is against his wife's wishes and she doesn't pay for the medical bills, how will they get paid so that he can continue to get care? I am unable to help myself because I'm only 20 and do not have the resources to. I apologize if this is complicated. Thank you so much for your help. Take your concerns to the hospital social worker and also call adult protective services. What you describe is elder abuse. You may also want to speak to an elder law lawyer.
