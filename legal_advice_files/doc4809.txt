 I was emotionally/mentally abused by my ex gf for almost three years and for 10 months she has gone on twitter semi regularly to now say that I was the one abusing her and sheâ€™s now even accused me of rape. Is there anything I can do to combat this legally or even defend myself of the rape/abuse allegation?
