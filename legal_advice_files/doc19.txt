 Need legal advice, for my Aunt. When my Aunt was 10 months old 1975, her father was killed in a crane accident at work. She never knew until now after recconecting with her grandmother that there was money for her. The amount of money was over $100,000. Her mother took the money and never told her, also her mother told her that her father's side of the family was evil and never to talk to them. What can she do now to try and get her money back from her mother? Thank you I believe a trust. "Money for her" as in cash in a bank account, or something more like a trust? ðŸ˜” Thank you California. I will have her check on the insurance company. Thank you very much for your feedback! What country/state did this occur in? A 100k in 1975 is worth about 477k today. If it sat in an account and collected interest, it would be worth a heck of a lot more than that. The money should have been put in a trust account, but it looks like it wasn't. Still, it wouldn't hurt to at least check. Even if a criminal statute of limitations has passed, there may be money out there. Your aunt should ask her father's side of the family what insurance company and/or bank handled the transaction and start your inquires there. The statute of limitations has long since passed for anything to be done
