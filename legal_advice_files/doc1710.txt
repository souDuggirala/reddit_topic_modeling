 I'll have to take a few days off for s/o's medical appointments. Work won't let me use sick days because we're not married. We don't know anyone for thousands of miles in any direction, so we can't get someone else to help. Coworkers have suggested getting a quick marriage so I can access my sick leave. This isnt a huge issue, but we'd rather have a small ceremony with friends and family later in the year. My question is, if I showed up one day and said we got married over the weekend (even if we didn't), could they ask to see some kind of proof or would I be in the clear? Yes. You would also be expected to change paperwork with HR for things like life insurance policy beneficiaries, health insurance, etc. Don't lie. You can do a courthouse ceremony and then a "real" one with friends and family later. The ceremony doesn't make the marriage. For any paid medical leave other than vacation an employer can generally ask for proof, but this depends on your country and state
