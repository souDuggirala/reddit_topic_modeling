Nvidia adversities G-sync as working seamlessly with SLi [https://www.nvidia.in/object/g-sync-faq-in.html](https://www.nvidia.in/object/g-sync-faq-in.html)

 How does NVIDIA G-SYNC work with SLI?

The NVIDA GPU connected to the display manages G-SYNC. SLI GPU setups work seamlessly with G-SYNC displays.

it does not and has not for 2 years. Nvidia knows this [https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/981786/sli/g-sync-eats-away-gpu-usage-and-fps/post/5042440/#5042440](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/981786/sli/g-sync-eats-away-gpu-usage-and-fps/post/5042440/#5042440) official level 2 support response 2 years ago stating it was being worked on. This is the very same response we get 2 years late that its sill being worked on.

I suffer this issue and have been in contact with Nvidia escalation support for over 6 months where they reproduced the issue and promised to address it with a software update. After they failed to resolve my issue in the promised Update i have now been asking they replace my hardware with hardware that offers the features i paid for and the performance i paid for. this request has been denied by Nvidia Global support supervisor.

What are my options getting this resolved.

&amp;#x200B; i made the mistake in believing them when they said it was going to be fixed and am well past the return period Return it and get another GPU?  thank you, unfortunately this issue was not present on the previous hardware arch. this was a issue was introduced with the Pascal Arch the advertisements where not changed with the Pascal release.  thank you, i have been thought the tech support level 1 and 2 the on to the top Josh Nvidia global support supervisor.  Nvidia has not fixed this in 2 years and have refused to resolve it with hardware.

 note it can be resolved with hardware, they have hardware that can do the advertised Gsync and provide the same  performance my current hardware can provide.  Demonstrating false advertising will require that you show how nvidia knew of the failure before they advertised the feature. You can file a complaint with your state Attorney General. I wouldn't expect much to come of it, though. Your options are going to be through tech support.
