 I am postgrad student. So far I have had this lecturer who seems to have a grudge with me actively try to make my experience here hell. In my meetings with him, I have had my personal belongings such as my notebooks flung off the desk, he also attempted to snatch my phone out of my hand and on a separate occasion my pen was snatched out of my possession while I was writing notes down. The lecturer has also threatened me saying that without his help and his signature I would not be able to get a job or graduate. I believe all these were done in order to agitate me or as a manipulative sort of power play. Since working with this lecturer, my project has been delayed for the past 3 months. He does not respond to any emails and tries to shift the blame to make me appear as an incompetent student. When I am supposed to attend meetings with him, instead of having it in a meeting room or even in any of the available classroom he insists on having it out of campus. I have also read that there has been a case where another lecturer in this same college was sacked for harassing students. I am wondering has anyone else experienced this, or if this is normal behaviour in other colleges? Also any advice on how to handle this would be much appreciated. I have already made complaints the dean as well as the vice chancellor of the university though no action was taken.
