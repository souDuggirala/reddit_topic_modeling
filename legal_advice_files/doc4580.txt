 Say there’s this guy who is not my biggest fan, said guy wants to beat me up, he comes onto my property(a farm outside of town) and wants to fight, what am I legally allowed to do? In small town Saskatchewan Canada. We are both under 18  I’d call the police if you legitimately think you’re in danger  Kill him in the face
