 Hello first time poster here. I will try to make it as easy to read and understand as possible so bear with me. I work for an oil and gas service company and a few years ago when the price of oil dropped the company I worked for started averaging our wages. I guess the easiest way to explain it would be to just show a copy of my pay stub but i'm not sure if that is a great idea so I will do my best. We have different pay rates for different types of work activity we do. For example, non revenue time is paid at a reduced rate as is drive time and safety meeting time. The only time paid at our full wage was "rig time", where the oil company would be billed for the time we worked on our rig. What would end up happening at the end of the pay period is all our time and wages would be averaged together and the actual pay rate was never the same from pay period to pay period. Lets say we drove 30 hours and worked 80 one pay period. Our drive time might be more or less, up to a dollar, then our actual driving wage. Our work wage would also be more or less, up to a dollar, then our actual working wage. When working overtime this discrepancy increased more. I am not sure how well I actually explained the situation. If it would help I would be more then happy to show someone a redacted pay stub just in case I did a poor job verbalizing the problem, or lack thereof? Thanks for your time. Happy Holidays =) Assuming you are in the US, yes it's entirely legal to pay an employee at different rates for performing different types of work. Your overtime premium should be based on a weighted average of hours worked for that week (or pay period) so it will also fluctuate. This is not a "discrepancy" but rather how the OT premium is supposed to be calculated.
