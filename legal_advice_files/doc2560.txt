 Recently, on twitter I sold an account in a video game. The person I sold the account to (75$) is threatening to take me to court, as he got locked out of the account, and is claiming I changed the password (I didn’t). He payed through friends and family on PayPal, which doesn’t let him charge back, and he is demanding me to charge back or he will find me (he claims he majors in cyber security) and take me to court. When I sold the account, I wasn’t very clear on the details, and he says I lied about some of the aspects of it. Did I do anything illegal? And if I did what should I do? Edit: I’m a minor Ok thanks Nobody is going to sue you for 75 dollars. It would cost more to file the lawsuit than that. Yep...paying you with F F means he cannot directly get the money back. If he files a chargeback with his credit card, they will take the money back from Paypal, who will take it from you. Even if he payed friends and family? Thanks for that, my dad knows some very good defense lawyers, so if he follows through I’d have good lawyers. You selling the account(and him buying the account) likely broke the TOS of the game. There isn't much he can do to get his money back, unless he paid you with a credit card(via Paypal). If he files a chargeback, Paypal will take the money from you. Not a Lawyer. You can probably tell him to pound sand unless he actually sues you, which I very much doubt he will. If he does, you'll need to get your parents and a lawyer involved, but, again, he's probably not going to sue.
