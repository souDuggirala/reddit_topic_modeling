 Hello, Thank you in advance for taking time to read my post. I help administer a small nonprofit who had purchased roughly 3000$ in goods from an out of state business (CA) in October 2018. Goods were paid for via check which cleared that same week. Since then the gentleman from which we bought the goods has flaked on us. Essentially months of excuses were followed by silence and no contact. This gentleman states he is in hospice care, although an outside bogus email sent several days ago with a "new order" was met with immeidate response by the seller willing to take more cash. We have retained an attorney who is looking into the matter on our behalf. I wanted to reach out to learn as much as I can on my own and have an intelligent conversation withour lawyer. Any advice or input would be appreciated. Thanks!  Then your option is to sue him for the money. That's your best recourse at this time. He will not respond to our contact attempts anymore. It is a single man company Have you requested a refund?
