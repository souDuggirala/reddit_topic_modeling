 Just like the title said, I got into a car accident just today. I was making an unprotected left turn into a street and I didnâ€™t see a car coming in so we collided. I have no idea what to fucking do. And I have no idea what will happen. Throwaway for reasons. Anything will help. What can I do to minimize losses/damage? You may get sued for damages.  Well, the best thing you could have done to minimize losses and damages would be not to drive uninsured and without a valid license. You will likely end up getting your license suspended for longer. You will be on the hook for any damages you caused out of pocket since you're uninsured. If you ever do get your license reinstated your insurance rates are going to be astronomical. There isn't a lot of wiggle room for you here, to be honest.
