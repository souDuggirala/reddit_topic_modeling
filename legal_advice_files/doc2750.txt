 If you don't speak English well, is this allowed?  Word up. If it's anything remotely serious, services are available in more than a dozen languages. ESPECIALLY French. If your English is weak and the scenario is serious, you will be able to have services in damned near any language spoken in the GTA. For more casual / informal interactions with police it may not be possible. Most cops should have a grasp of basic French, but apparently so do I and all I can reliably do is curse a blue streak in Quebecois. Toronto has ended stop and frisk/carding.  If you’re not being detained and you understand the request then there’s not much need for a translator unless that situation changes.  When Police just want to talk to you. Like you're not committing a crime or about to commit a crime, and you're not operating a vehicle. Like if you're walking and they ask you for ID.  You can request whatever you want, but depending on the context you may not be entitled to that. You aren't generally required to talk to the police at all unless you are driving a vehicle. You can't refuse to talk to an officer in the context of a traffic stop in Toronto, although in the National Capital Region you might get away with this. If you are arrested and charged you would at least be entitled to translation in the context of a court proceeding. What is the context of this “conversation”?
