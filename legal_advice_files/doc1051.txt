 I've contacted my landlord about this and he has done nothing about it. I've called the cops, but he wasn't there. This guy has Christmas lights in there, a toaster oven, and I have to walk past this door to get to my car. I don't feel safe. Is there anything I can do to make my landlord do something? Is he legally responsible if this guy stabs me or breaks into my apartment or car? Never actually saw the person, but sleeping bag, used underwear, cellphone charger, etc in the room. Called maintenance and they got me a new lock, but they wouldnt remove the belongings. Had to pester them for months until they did.  How did you resolve it? They are pretty sneaky! Had this happen to me too, but my wh closet was on tear foot. Didnt find out for a long time. Dont ask me how I didnt notice  Thanks!! Thanks!! Yes, call every time. The comment below adds some important information too Yes. The dispatcher can see on their screen what other calls were made for an address. They'll let the responding officer know that there's been multiple calls about the issue.  I did, but he wasn't there. Should I just keep calling every time I see him?  Call the police. Breaking and entering  Maybe you should get to know the guy and drop off some food.
