 Location: Michigan I have no heat. The landlord had someone come out this morning and I was informed that the heat exchanger needs to be replaced which is about a 2000 fix. He says that if its been cracked then it is possible that theirs been carbon monoxide leaking into my house. He says he needs to contact the landlord and that I may not have heat for days or until after Christmas. I am a single mother of 2 children. I contact the landlord to make sure he spoke to the furnace guy and he does not respond. I told him 3 months ago there was an issue. I had issues with the air not working for a month when I moved in, in September. So my questions is. If he doesn't answer me and doesn't fix it what can I do? Also if I need to leave my home for a week will he need to reimburse me for expenses? If their has been a carbon monoxide leak in my house for the time I have had the heat on, what can I do about this? Help!
