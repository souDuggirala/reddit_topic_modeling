 As stated above, I am having my interview for my permanent residency next month. I don't see how it's necessary to hire a lawyer since I already paid $300 for the procedure training and it doesn't seem worth it to pay another $300 (up from $200 last year) just for the lawyer to show up. I can afford to pay them but from my principle point of view I am thinking by paying them I'm accepting their price increase. Because of this, I got into a fight with my parents just because I don't want to cash out that $300 and they claim I'm being cocky and overconfident. They said hiring a lawyer could help me secure my green card application. Should I pay the $300? TL;DR: Hiring lawyer costs $300 up from $200 before. Has the money but my principle says not to pay. Got in a fight my family. Uncertain whether to follow my decision or pay for it and be embarrassed.  You could also post at r/immigration to get insight into the marginal benefit of being represented at this interview.
