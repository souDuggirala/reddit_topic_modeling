 So I know if I own a car and live in NY it has to be registered in NY state, but it is unclear what the law is regarding a car owned by someone living in another state. The title, registration, and insurance for the vehicle are all under my father who lives in another state, but I am driving the car while being a resident of NY. Does the law really compel him to sell me the car? Or me to not drive it, even with his permission? Thanks. He needs to add you as a rated driver and update the garaging address to yours in NY  If the vehicle is to be primarily driven and garaged in New York it will need to be registered in New York. You may be able to [register it in your name]() with a signed affidavit from your father. Or you can [have your father register it in New York.]() I would contact the DMV to see the easiest way to proceed. You may be able to get away with failing to register it in NY for some time but the penalties are usually pretty harsh if you get caught.  It can stay registered to him in his state while you drive it but he should make his insurance company aware of the situation.
