 Sorry, I hope this is the right place to ask this! If not, please feel free to redirect me. I went in to get a background check for a job and (along with my name and address), somebody else's popped up. I don't recognize the name or address. The background check isn't finished yet so I don't know if any criminal charges have shown up yet but I'm waiting on that part. How do I know if this was just a mistake in the system or if my identity has actually been compromised? I track my finances pretty strictly and as far as I know, my credit score is in good shape and I've never been contacted about any debts. I also have my credit frozen at all three of the major credit reporting agencies. Is there anything else I should do in the meantime to figure out what's going on? Thanks! This is common. Google ‘social security trace’ to read about these types of databases. They can identify ID theft but are generally just data entry errors. You can pull your credit report for free 3x per year under the FCRA.
