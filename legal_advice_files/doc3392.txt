 I lost my drivers license and it was found from a club so I wrote to the club’s Facebook page to get it back but they are convinced I gave it to an underage person and now they dont want to give it to me and are threatening to give the “case” to the police. What should I do? And what are my rights? It was one week ago and no I havent ordered a replacement yet. Yea but it includes paperwork and stuff, no? If I just let them give it to the police and then later go and take my ID from the police Call the police yourself. Tell them a club is holding your identification. Either go with them to retrieve it or ask the club to surrender it to the police so you can collect it. Contact the DMV, report it lost, get a replacement, carry on with life. How long ago did you lose it? I am assuming that did not, in fact, give it to someone underage. Have you ordered a replacement? Did you give it t someone underage? If not, tell them it sounds great. Please hand the ID over to the police and you can pick it up form them. If the only evidence they have is that it happened to be found at a bar, then it would be difficult to prosecute.
