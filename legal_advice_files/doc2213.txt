 Earlier this year (October 22nd) i moved into a new house. I rented the house from an excoworker. I originally planned to move in with a roommate but within the first week of getting everything moved in (their stuff included). The roommate bailed on me, making money right at that moment. I was originally supposed to move in on the 15th but was not yet able to, due to the landlord taking her time moving out. After a week of waiting (oct 22) I was able to move in. I was supposed to pay half of rent for the 2nd half of the month. I then disputed this with her and only paid my first full month (Nov) in full and NOT for half of October. Since then, I have paid rent on time every month. Today I received a summons for an eviction via mail. This is calling for me to go to court tomorrow. What should I do or how can I expect this to go down? I also wanted to mention that the landlord left a lot of belonging at my current residence. There are 3 sheds on the property and the attached garage that are filled with her stuff. This has caused a problem with my roommate situation because I have to use the spare bedrooms for storage. There are two vehicles on the property ( in my front lawn) that were also supposed to be moved but have yet to be touched.
