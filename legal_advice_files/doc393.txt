 So today I woke up to go to work only to find that my car had been stolen. Locked car, inside a gated, controlled access parking garage. I panicked because not only was my car gone, but I always keep my wallet in my glove box, because I ALWAYS lock my car(I know I know, I won’t do it anymore). So I called the non emergency line and an officer came to get a formal report. After this I called my insurance company and they said that because of the fact that my car was inside of a gated area they can’t provide cash value for it, even though we have comprehensive coverage. Do I have the right to sue the apartment complex? I would definitely call back and try to talk to someone else. Not sure of your location, but I had a vehicle stolen and it was explained to me that there is a waiting period before they pay out anyway. A grace period to see if the car is found first, and if so, then they want to assess the damage. My insurance agent told me that most stolen cars are actually recovered. I did not believe her. My vehicle was recovered about 10 days later.  Have you checked your car insurance policy in detail? Did they point out to you which language specifically exempts theft from inside locked garages? Because that is a very unusual policy detail.  Start off by calling back and asking talking to a different person. I don't understand why being in a gate would matter, unless you told the insurance that the car is normally parked in a garage and it is actually parked in like a gated lot or something.  Call your insurance back. There's no reason why this shouldn't be covered. This is exactly what insurance is for.
