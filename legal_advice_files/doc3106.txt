 The cops I know have an ID card from their departments that lists their name, rank, and department. I've never looked, but it probably has some ID number, too. I don't know if they're ever actually required to ID themselves, but that's the card they show to reassure people that they are, in fact, cops. thanks [removed] Correct. There could be a random state law that says otherwise, but wide and far, there's no such law compelling an officer to do so, especially to a suspect or random civilian.  are you saying police officers don't have to provide a name or badge number? The 'badge number' in a lot of departments is a TV misnomer. Some departments may not have badge numbers. In others, they may not mean anything (it's a number possibly serialized to the officer's equipment list but not tracked in the HR system). Most officers will carry business cards. Even patrol, who're expected to do things like document traffic reports, should have a card they can drop. So, rather than asking for a badge or shield number, just ask for a card for followup. Failing that, the name pinned to their shirt should suffice. Each department should have an SOP for dealing with the public (some use contact cards the officer is required to fill out at the conclusion of any engagement with a member of the public; some will require a note in the terminal; some will not have anything, but still require that officers positively identify themselves). Regardless, the answer to your question will be dictated by local department policies. They're not legally obligated to identify themselves other than as the police.
