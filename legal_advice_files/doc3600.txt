 Throwaway account, sorry if this is not the right place to post but I don't know where else I could possibly post this, I live in Malaysia with my family. Once every few months we would have our pest repellant guys to come over to spray some sort of chemical to keep pests away (obviously). The real issue came when my mum noticed some of her jewelry gone missing from her drawer, she looked high and low and has not yet to have found her lost jewelry. Our suspicions fall on the pest repellant guys due to previously my sister having cash stolen from her drawer the last time the same guys came over (but that was long time ago so we thought it might be her just being forgetful). Is it possible if I could setup some hidden cameras and attempt to catch them in the act and try to apprehend them or is there any other method of determining if they are the culprits behind this issue? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thank you.
