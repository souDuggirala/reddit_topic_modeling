 So my best friend was working at his price chopper Monday night. He was doing carts and got hit by a USPS truck. The truck hit his lower left leg and caused him to fall into the carts and his knee is messed up. The driver drove off, so it was a hit and run. He went to the doctor and he has several torn ligament and possibly muscle damage. He was able to give an accurate description of the driver, the truck and has multiple witnesses. But the police threw out the case because the driver’s GPS said she was in the driving lane even though that isn’t true. They just re-opened the case because he got 1 more witness. Is there anything else he can do?  They do but the angles they’re at make it fuzzy. It was also dark and they aren’t good quality. Does the store have security cameras? If so they could also help Not legal advice. GPS can easily be inaccurate enough to make determining what lane you are in, impossible. How long was it between this reporting to the police and them saying they could determine what lane the driver was in Need to know location, but there is a tort claim. He may have a shorter time limit to bring it, because it is the USPS. Cops only look for criminal wrongdoing. Civil suit is broader and should be pursued. Start the workers comp process with PChopper, let their WC insurance subrogate the post office for the medical care.
