 First time posting - on Saturday I accidentally left my bag on the bus and contacted the bus company, it hasnt been handed in to lost and found. The bag had my wallet and passport in it, so I'm obviously interested in getting it. I've already called the Police and they will get back to me in the meantime if anything gets given in. I've also reported my passport and card missing. Is there anything I can do in the meantime, in particular getting access to CCTV on the bus as I know the time I left the bus. Thank you.  Ok that makes sense, thanks for the reply :) There is nothing you can do. Your belongings were likely left behind, then stolen, the money and cards taken from your wallet, and the rest discarded. If you have already cancelled any bank/credit cards, you’ve done everything you need to do already. You can go ahead and start the process to replace your identification and cards, but that’s it. The bus company is under no obligation to release CCTV to you. Even if they did- how would that help? An image of a total stranger picking up your belongings? The police aren’t going to put out a press release or try to ID a mystery person over the theft of a wallet and passport.
