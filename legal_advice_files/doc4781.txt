 ## Hello, can anybody advise, I was wondering is it legal to use photos found on internet from film series "x" with some actors, and remake it in photoshop (make it for example more cartoon look ... , add some text colors, etc.) after that am I able to print it frame it and sell it legally ? Saw lots of things like that on Etsy and was wondering is it legal ? Another thing is if I have a photo form movie with original signatures of actors, may I scan it and reprint it and sell for small amount of money ? Im just curious. Saw some reprints from photos with original autographs on Ebay. no.
