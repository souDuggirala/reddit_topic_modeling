I have an issue in finding law that allows two parties, who previously agreed in a contractual provision to have exclusive jurisdiction in State A, to waive this provision of the contract and sue in State B. Is there such law? I’ve been researching a lot of “conflict of law” issues but doesn’t seem to pop anywhere.
