 (Kansas) for location. So a couple months ago, my roommate moved out, and upon switching the utilities into my name somehow got stuck with responsibility for their unpaid balance. The utility company claims that "Because I am on the lease, and have been living there the whole time as well, that it is just as much my responsibility to take on the bill." However, when signing up for services, I had to give my social, as well was told that if I were to not pay, the bill would just stay with me. I feel as if they shouldn't be allowed to do that, especially since they had to get my SSN. Is there any recourse I can take, aside from the small claims towards roommate idea?  I didn't take over their account though, I switched the utilities into my name aka opened an account under my name. And as for them transferring the other balance, how is that different than say, me opening up a credit card, and just transferring the balance to someone else because I'm not going to pay? It doesn't seem legal to transfer a bill from person to person, especially when credit/ssn is involved... A cautionary tale about taking over accounts instead of closing/opening a new one. I would look into the electric company's responsibility to inform you of the outstanding balance when you were taking over the account, but most cities make the rules and own their energy supply you are probably SOL in that regard. Unfortunately it is very likely that because you share the address and now have your name on the bill it is your responsibility. Small claims is probably your best bet but I would seek legal advice and look into your options. Unpaid bills can effect your credit rating though, so try and resolve it quickly. There are ways to get your SSN. It's not like you not telling them means they can never find it. If you're on the account then you need to pay this balance.
