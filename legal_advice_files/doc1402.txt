 Some context: Individual upper cut me during a basketball game and gave me very serious, permanent injuries. Very easy case as he even admitted it to a detective (along with several witnesses and video evidence). He was suppose to have a preliminary hearing today and has been in prison for past week. I get a call from the DA’s office (Georgia) earlier today and while speaking to someone handling my case they were telling me how he isn’t going to be released while he is being sentenced as he has many priors. They also told me his preliminary hearing was delayed from today to next week. Just now, I get a call from the prison he was at saying how he just bonded out and if he tries to have any contact with me, to call 911. WTF? How can they let this lunatic out? I don’t know the state of mind this guy is in and I am afraid for myself and my family if he is able to find my address. Can anyone explain what possibly happened? Is it because the preliminary hearing was delayed?  But the preliminary hearing didn’t happen today. It was delayed  His attorney convinced a judge that he should have bail/bond set, and he was bonded out. The DA over estimated himself.
