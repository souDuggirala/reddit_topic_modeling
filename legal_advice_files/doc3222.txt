 I am a graduate student in the USA, and over the last several years, I have been teaching myself computer programming in my free time by working independently on an iPhone app based on an existing card game. That card game uses a nonstandard deck of cards, with each card containing a different combination of colored/shaded shapes. The official game maker has their own iPhone versions of the game in the App Store, and there are several knockoffs in the App Store that use the same exact gameplay but with slightly different colors and shapes. Everything in my app is made from scratch, and the entire app (excluding the startup screen and icon) are made live in the app programmatically (instead of using static image files). Nowhere in my version do I reference the original game's name or logo. My shapes are the same name (e.g., "oval") but not traced, and my colors are the same name (e.g., "green") but not the same hex code. How much do I have to change to put my version in the App Store? What is the worst that happens if I do not change anything? Thanks! tl;dr I made a game based on a another game. How much do I need to change before publishing it?
