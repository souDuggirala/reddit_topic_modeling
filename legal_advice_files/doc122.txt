 Ever since i left my mother's home to live with my father my mother has refused to give me any of my legal documents and i dont know why. Ive tried asking for them nicely and she refuses. Im looking to get into a driver's ed course and for that i need my legal documents which i do not have a hold of. Is this lillegal, could police get involved in order to scare her into giving me my documents or what else can i do? I know that my father could go to someplace to get them but it would be very difficult to do since he works all day and that would mean for him to get a day off of work , which means less money, which we are very tight on at the moment. Any help/advice would be appreciated. Good! Unfortunately a lot of people find out about this when they're your age. I was born in the US. Not a chance. Uncomfortable question, but it's come up occasionally... is there any possibility you're not a citizen? A lot of the time, you can get the birth certificate over the internet, for a fee. There might even be a waiver if you can't afford the fee, but you'd have to ask. NAL It would be way easier just to get new copies. She has no legal obligation to hand her copies over. Start with a copy of your birth record which your dad can help you get for around $20 at your local records office (same place you go to get a marriage liscence). Then once you have that go to the local social security office with it and ask for a copy of your social security card. The police aren't there to be utilized as a scare tactic. She has no legal obligation to give you any documentation. Correct the father can apply for copies of both documents. Solving your current predicament. Your father can request a certified copy of your birth certificate and a new SS card for you.
