 Hi all, I am in the middle of a divorce that I do not want for context, but I’m ready for this all to be done with. My husband contacted a mediator who was supposed to file with the court 3 weeks ago and then have me served. He called me that day and said that he was filing the paperwork with the court and could mail it to me, which I agreed to, figuring I’d get a certified letter in the mail. A week goes by and I don’t get anything so I emailed him and asked if there was an issue to be served. This was November 7th. He replied to confirm my address on the 8th and said he would mail it again. On the 15th I get another email asking to confirm my address and stating that he will mail the paperwork again and attached the petition to the email for me to review in the meantime. Today he calls me and says that I need to tell him if I agree to the petition so he can file with the court, and that everything was the same as what my husband and I had agreed in his office. I never met with this mediator in his office, which I told him. I also told him that according to his emails and what I was told the petition should have already been filed and he was mailing me the paperwork. The mediator seemed like he just didn’t know what was going on and talked down to me like I was a child. I am very frustrated and angry with this guy and I’m just wondering if there is anything that can be done legally. I am in Northeast Florida for reference.  I have a paralegal that I trust and is familiar with this mediator reviewing things with me later today. Husband said he’s frustrated with this guy too. He was told to file with the court three weeks ago and never did. Didn’t clarify with me that he wouldn’t be, and then never sent me ANYTHING to review. I don’t think he is trying to take advantage, just wants it to be over with, as do I.  Dont sign anything until you get a lawyer of your own. Sounds like your soon to be ex is trying to take advantage of the situation
