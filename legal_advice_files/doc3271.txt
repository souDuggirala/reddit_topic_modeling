 So I worked at Panera Bread and tweeted out how it was gross that Panera Bread has frozen soups and mac+cheese, the social media guy found the tweet and I was soon fired from the store. I guess I signed something saying that I couldn't say anything bad about the company while in employment, but the one thing that caught me off guard was one of the managers telling me the corporation could sue me for exposing company secrets? They can sue me for that? Did I sign some contract with some kind of punishment of being sued? Being fired, I get but I figured that it was already public information that they microwave their macs and have frozen soups because I've seen other tweets and articles about it... Does anyone have any experience with Panera? What I meant is they can sue for anything, will they waste the resources and effort for going after you? Seeing that I doubt your tweet made an impact, I'd say probably not  You definately signed a Media agreement during your orientation. Any company with a brain has these I'm sure they can sue you for anything. Will they actually follow through? Ehhhhhh I highly doubt they lost profits with your tweet. I'd say it's a scare tactic so you don't keep bashing them on social media.  If they’re searching social media for “Panera bread”... why would Reddit be any different? I would delete this post instead of digging this any further and just let sleeping dogs lie.  How is it gross to freeze food? Probably not.  Words of advice. 1) read all paperwork before signing it. 2) don't badmouth your current employer on social media.  They can sue you for disclosing company trade secrets, even absent any agreement. Nobody here can tell you whether your tweet was an unlawful disclosure of trade secrets, though.   Absent a contract, they'd be hard-pressed to win a lawsuit over your actions.
