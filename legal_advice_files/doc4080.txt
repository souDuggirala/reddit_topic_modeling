 Hi! I had a unique employment situation. I was a full-time, salaried wedding photographer for a smaller company that specialized in weddings. I've since left that organization (7 people) and have moved on to something else. I didn't leave on great terms, mainly because I'm still being forced to shoot some weddings that had already been booked prior to departure all the way into next year. That's an entirely different legal situation, but just trying to give background. The issue I'm having is that my ex-employer is posting weddings that I shot and delivered on his blog. He's also writing as me, under my name. For example "I loved shooting this wedding, this couple is so in love, blah blah blah" . Is he legally allowed to do this? He owns the copyright for the photos, so that's ok and I understand that, but he writes terribly and is saying things that I would never say. It's posted under my name with my photo. Basically, he's covering his ass because he doesn't want my future couples to know I've separated from the company. He's also threatened legal action if I tell them. It's incredibly unsettling and I'm not happy about it. I'm not sure if this is allowed, but here is one of the blogs: [http://www.makingthemoment.com/blog/2018/sam-zak-ariel-international-cleveland-wedding](http://www.makingthemoment.com/blog/2018/sam-zak-ariel-international-cleveland-wedding) Even looking this blog up, I see another blog that he posted and then credited to Tyler, who is another photographer from the organization. Is this some sort of misrepresentation that's illegal? It's definitely dirty, unscrupulous, and misleading. I'm just not sure whether I should get a lawyer involved... Thanks in advance! If I need to pull down the link, just tell me.
