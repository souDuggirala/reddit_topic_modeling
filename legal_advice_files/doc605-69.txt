How could you start a Q&amp;A site or Facebook group in the United States while Being GDPR compliant? For a Facebook group, GDPR would apply to Facebook, not the owner of the group. You aren't responsible for any information they are collecting. [deleted] No but i dont know if there will be Europeans that join.  Will you be based out of Europe/the UK and be processing a lot of personal data? If not then the GDPR does not apply to you at all.  Probably science and technology  What are the Q&amp;A about?
