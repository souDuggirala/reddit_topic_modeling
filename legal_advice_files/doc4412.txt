 Idk why i was sitting at home and i thought that if we wanted to eradicate racism we should stop saying black is evil or bad then i came to thought that why it is said "BLACK" Money and not "ILLICIT or ILLEGAL" Money. So if we want to eradicate racism first of all we need to change our minds and think that black is not evil.
