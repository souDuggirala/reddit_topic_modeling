I've been working on creating a podcast as a hobby during my downtime. I'd like to use a different poem or a small piece of literature in the beginning of each episode. Would I be able to use that material as long as I reference the author? 

would it be legal?

this may be a dumb question but I'm learning that copyright can be very complex and I don't want to get in trouble in the future.
