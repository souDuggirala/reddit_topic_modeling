 I live in Michigan I work for a franchise Mcdonalds. Ive been working there since 2014 but took a leave this past fall (2018) for school. I worked on and off during that semester but only if i got called in. I decided to go back to work part time this semester but only as a shift manager and not a department manager (winter 2019). I got my first paycheck February 4th. My pay was deducted from $12.25 to $11.00. I have been back for nearly 3 weeks and none of my bosses gave me any notification before it went into effect. Is there anything I can do?  Your wage wasn't reduced, your job title changed. Different levels of responsibility, different levels of compensation. Ya I understand why it got dropped... my point obviously went way over your head. They didnâ€™t give me any notice... and in the state of Michigan employers must give a notice of wage reduction before it goes into effect. I came to this page to get advice not be insulted thanks. You said it yourself, you're only a shift manager and not a department manager. I'm no lawyer, but before you start thinking about serving everyone, start by having a conversation with your boss. I know, I know, talking is hard. You changed roles and stepped down to a position with less responsibility, obviously the two positions are not going to pay the same.
