 Is it legal to wear masks in public (such as stores, malls, restaurants, or any other public location) in the state of Indiana?  Most stores do not allow masks inside: this isnt public property, its private. As for in public, its not illegal. To cover your face, but it is considered enough reasonable suspicion for a police officer to legally stop you and request you to identify yourself via ID and face verification. Depending on why you want to wear a mask, it can be considered a public disturbance or public nuisance (Shouting at people in a ski mask on a street corner for example) Sometimes, most reasonably sized places will have all their local codes and ordinances in some digital form online but it might not be as fun or easy as you imagine. This also might be a legitimate question for your local non emergency police line. Thank you! Would a quick google search tell me what I need to know? You have to search your local ordinances in your city/county. These sorts of things are often very specific to a region. The definition of public can also vary. In my local area you can’t wear masks in public parks or schools but you can just on the street as long as you aren’t menacing other people.
