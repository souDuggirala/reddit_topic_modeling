 My neighbor’s towering tree is mostly dead and covered in ivy. Over the years large branches have fallen, taking out our fence and damaging their house. Can we force them to remove it? If it falls on our house can we sue for repairs and inconvenience? I feel this is an inevitable end to the tree’s life. (we are in California) Hey, insurance agent in Oregon and Washington - recommendations should be similar for California. When I have a client tell me they have a problem neighbor with a condition such as this, I recommend the following: - contact the city - there may be a particular person in charge of fielding ordinance or condition complaints - contact your insurance company with your concerns (it is likely that they will tell you your insurance would cover damage from falling tree limbs, even if the tree is in poor health so long as it belongs to a neighbor and that your insurance company would seek to recover both their costs and your deductible from your neighbor’s insurance, if they even carry it) - retain information about your attempts to contact the neighbor to resolve this - if the neighbor still takes no action, send a letter through certified mail (retain a copy) stating that you will hold them accountable for all expenses related to damage caused to your home by the tree Again, contact your own agent to verify this general advice and to verify if they will cover such a situation in the event of damage along with their procedures for handling such claims. Insurance agents can actual be a great resource for questions like this.
