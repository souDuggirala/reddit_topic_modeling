 Hello Reddit! I am 21 years old and with Scotiabank. Today I received at letter in the mail from BMO bank and inside of it was a T4A with my name and information on it requesting I fill it out. When I opened it I was confused as I do not have a BMO account and already completed the one I received from Scotiabank. When I asked my parents about this my mother instantly grabbed it and told me it was for my education fund. This worried me because first off, I was told that my education fund was shared between my two sister's and I, as well as the major part, my mother is extremely greedy, threatening my dad with divorce just so she can take our home and sell it. When it comes to money and this type of stuff she worries me. I don't really know any other places to post this but I would like to know your opinion about what I should do. This is my first year filling out a T4A so I am unsure if this is normal or not. Thanks &lt;3 You can use CRA My Account to obtain another copy of your T4A (and all your other T slips if necessary). This may be helpful in determining what holdings are at BMO. Anyone can open an RESP for any young person, so if your mother has opened one for you (and your sisters) that is not necessarily a concern. If you are going to school, you can try to use it. If you never end up having to pay for post-secondary education, your mother can withdraw her contributions and transfer any interest income to her RRSP (if she has contribution room). Go to a BMO branch and talk to them. Sorta seems like your mother has opened an account in your name, and that should make you worried.
