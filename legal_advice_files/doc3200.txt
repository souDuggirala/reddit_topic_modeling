 I’m located in Rockbridge county, Virginia. My now ex husband and I got a dog together in 2015, all of which I paid for (2,000) and is in my name on the purchasing contract, we married in 2016, divorced in 2017. We have been roommates since with no issue, we have 6 dogs total counting the one we got in 2015. I pay for all their medical care, food, treats (totaling over 7,000 dollars just for the 2015 dog) , and I actually spend the majority of the time with them while he sits in his room playing video games. Now he is moving out and wants to take the 2015 dog. Is there any legal action I can take to keep her? He has been abusive to our other dogs in the past but I have no concrete evidence other then several eye witnesses. I fear for her quality of life if he takes her. I was out of town for three days and came home to find my house covered in dried urine, diarrhea and mud. The dogs go without food if he is in charge of them if I have to go out of town for work. It has gotten to the point when I go I pay someone to come and take care of them when I am away with the exception being this past weekend. We are completely divorced and settled our own property, he did not want anything. Thank you all in advance for any advice you can provide. Were the dogs addressed in the divorce agreement? All paperwork is in my name except her akc registration but I don’t know how much weight that holds, it’s all my contact info just his name. [removed] In some states, like CA and now AZ, dogs are considered community propert. What is looked at is who cares for the pet, who takes it for medical care etc.  He is trying to claim her as a gift to take her. You bought that pup before you were married. The pup isn’t considered community property.
