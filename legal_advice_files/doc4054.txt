 i have a good trusting relationship with my neighbor, and she's hired bonded insured referred people to redo her kitchen over the coming weeks (i'm semi retired so home a lot, she's out working weekdays 8am-7pm). i'm just nervous if something goes wrong, that somehow i'll be held liable because i let them in and closed up after them. i'm not expected to watch them all day, but she did ask me to drop in occasionally just to "check up" on them so they know someone is nearby concerned the work is being done properly. anyway, i was thinking of maybe finding some generic one page boiler plate agreement i can get my neighbor and i to sign, holding me harmless in case something goes terribly wrong with her renovation work. if it matters she's not paying me to be her "keymaster", but there is a documented history of her occasionally reimbursing me for materials i used when doing handy work jobs she asked me to do around her home. i'm not a handyman or contractor, just a weekend diy'er trying to be a good neighbor. Exactly. Don’t approve or reject work, just inform her. If she needs to make a decision about something, let her communicate it directly to the contractor. that's a good point... so be her eyes and ears - but not her mouth. i should also make it clear to the contractor that telling me anything does not free them from the obligation to inform her - the homeowner. No, you won’t be held responsible for something like this. Her contract is with the contractor, not you. But don’t give advice to the contractor, or tell him to proceed on additional work without speaking her first.
