 Throwaway for privacy reasons So as the title says, yesterday I was pulled over by police doing a 'Random' stop and they decided to saliva test me for drugs. I live in the east of England Long story short, I came back positive for weed, even though I've not smoked for 5 days prior, I think its because I was with a friend who was smoking earlier that day. Anyway, so they took me to the station and did a blood test and now i have to wait 4-6 weeks for the results of this. Can anyone tell me what the best course of action to take is, as I have never been in any trouble like this before and am slightly worried as to what may come of it? Is there anything I can do whilst waiting for the blood results to come back or do I just have to wait and see? I have spoken to a relative who was an experienced police officer and he has said not to bother with a solicitor as they will unlikely be able to change the outcome if it gets that far, Is this true? if so what should i be doing to prepare myself for what may be ahead or should I just speak to a solicitor I am hesitant as i know they are very expensive and I don't really have that much money but arrangements could be made. Thanks for any replies at all. Weed stays in your system for a lot longer than 5 days if you have been a regular user up until recently as a side note. It depends on testing method, but if it was a saliva test and you smoke most days multiple times a day it could be detectable for up to a month afterwards.
