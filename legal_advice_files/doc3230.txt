 I have a nonpaying client who I worked for for about 360 hours over a 5 week period a year and a half ago. I never had an actual contract but I do have a string of text messages in which he says or confirms how much he owes me and for what. If I take him to small claims, can I collect standard late fees?  Late fees that you make up, typically not unless it's covered in a contract. Reasonable interest for late payment, often yes it would be granted. Of course interest rates are so low you get a pittance for your trouble. Each state has different laws that apply. It's common for states to have a statutory interest rate. In many cases it's much higher than the actual interest rate because the law hasn't been updated in recent years. If your agreement did not include late fees then you aren't entitled to them. You can sue for the amount owed. In the future you should have a written contract that includes late fees.
