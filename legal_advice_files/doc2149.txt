 My sister took my car to school and she was not licensed or insured. I was and have been ever since. She got into an accident and was declared guilty and she was sued by the other person (2015). She had no saving or assets; she asked if she could pay of the debt in loans but she was told no. Since the plaintiff didn't get anything from her; they are now suing her and me (2018). What can happen? I have only my car (asset), which I am still paying off, and no savings. I am in college and pay for my tuition out of pocket. How could this affect me in the future (i.e. graduate school). Can I go to jail? Will they garnish my pay, because it is already a small amount and I barely make it as it is. Thank you so much for your time and help. P.S. I live in the state of Tx  By "she has to get a judgement against you" do you mean my sister against me? If we both receive judgement then we could both have our paychecks garnished? Thank you so much for your help!  She has to get a judgement against you. She may /may not win. Show up to court and let them sort it out. If you do receive a judgement against you, she could technically garnish your wages up to 25% until it's paid off.
