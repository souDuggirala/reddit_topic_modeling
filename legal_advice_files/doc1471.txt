 So my mom got pulled over not too long ago, and they told her she had a Restriction B on her (valid) license, granting her a ticket. However, she later found another valid license that does NOT have the Restriction B. These licenses both expire on the same day, and now she has to go through the court system. Is there something we could do? Is there some way to use the unrestricted license as some sort of proof this was a mistake from DPS's part? (This took place in Texas, if that matters.) See if you can get a printout from the DMV (or whatever itâ€™s called in TX). It should list every single detail about her license and if she had a valid license for what she was accused of, they will likely dismiss it. Then get rid of the bad license.
