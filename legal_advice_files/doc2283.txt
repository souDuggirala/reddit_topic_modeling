 To make a long story short, I entered into an oral contract with my boss that I would work manual labor on site for $25/hr and would be compensated for the management paperwork via. 5-10% commission depending on performance. We finished thr job ahead of schedule and even saved money. Now that the job is over, i have requested my check for commissio and he states that we never made that deal. Yes, i know I should have written the contract out but i know that oral contracts are both valid and enforceable. So now he is basically telling me that he is not paying me... He owes me between $10-20k... What should I do? Demands on how OP responds to my follow up question, I have feeling this was a $200k project and he was offered 5-10% of the profit as a bonus which would be much much less.  Your location matters OP.  This is dependant on location but is likely out of the realm of small claims.  You can sue in small claims court... out of curiosity was this 5-10% based on the contract value or profit on the job?
