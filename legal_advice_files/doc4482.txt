 I like to take old photos, specifically from WW1, and add color and remove any blemishes and make it look HD. My question is: can I sell those photographs online after I have finished working on them, for $5-$10? Thanks. Do you own the rights to the original photos, or are they public domain? If so, yes; if somebody else owns the copyright, then no, as the colorized versions are a derivative work. (Photos from WWI are not necessarily public domain; it depends on who took the photos and whether or not they have been published, as that term is defined in copyright law.) IANAL WWII sounds like well past the 20 years for public domain, but that may only apply to music. I'm willing to bet yes, but wait for other responses here.
