 I got laid off yesterday because my employer can't pay my salary anymore the company is not making any money and is in the negative. I have 5 days PTO, they want me to sign a separation agreement that includes 5 days of severance pay. I don't think they're gonna pay my PTO. Should I just sign the agreement? Do they owe me the PTO? The separation agreement says nothing about paying PTO. They want me to sign the agreement by Tuesday to qualify for the severance pay. Also, can I file for unemployment when my severance pay ends? This is all throwing me for a loop. Location: Illinois Check your employment contract, if you have one. Generally you would entitled to payout of your PTO. That said, Illinois explicitly considers severance as payment for past services, and allows unemployment in such cases. Lastly, severance is considered above and beyond what they are required to pay, but I would still read over every part of what youâ€™re agreeing to in return. It should be for release of any future claims you may have with the company. I did a quick search and It appears Illinois does require employers to pay out PTO at end of employment
