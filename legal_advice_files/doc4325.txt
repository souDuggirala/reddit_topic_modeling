 Despite repeated excuses of “it’s not ready”, “I was sick”, or “my dog died”, the tailor that’s altering my suit refuse to give it back while I know she hasn’t worked on it for weeks. Also, it’s been couple weeks since our first agreed pick up date. (Similar reviews can be found on yelp with this establishment) I tried to google similar situations to see if there are any laws that can protect me as a consumer to get my belongings back. With no good or relative information, I want to reach out to you guys for any laws or ideas on how to approach this problem Thanks!  Nothing more than standard and common-law contract law. There isn't anything specific in the law regarding this situation. You can wait. You can demand the suit back and a refund for failing to fulfill the contract. You can sue in small claims for the value of the suit (that would the value of it used and modified, much much lower than retail) California small claims requires a demand letter before going forward with such a suit.
