 So I made an order on Amazon the other day and the post turned up as a "shipping error." The order showed up a few days later doubled. They seem to know I have the double order, but can they do anything to take it back or am I good to keep it? I'm concerned about being charged again as it is around $800 worth of items. This wasn't a blind shipment in the mail from someone unknown. You ordered the item and were sent a double shipment. This is an error. You are not obligated to ship them back at your expense, but must make a good faith effort if they want the items back. You can be billed or even potentially sued if you refuse. Stop being a dirt bag. They'll likely find out when they do audits and you'll certainly get charged.  No you cannot just keep both. you need to contact them and they'll either send you a return label or tell you to keep it, given the value of the package they will probably supply a retunr label.  I apologize for not being clear enough. I know it's not the "nice" thing to do, but I'm wondering if I can keep both copies without repercussions. It was their mistake, and while Amazon is convenient, I don't feel that bad keeping the items when THEY messed up. You won't be charged double. Just contact them and say you got both and need a return label.  Contact Amazon; theyâ€™ll pick it up.
