 So the leaks were definitely disclosed, but the owners stated that they had been repaired and described what the issues had been and where they had been repaired. As soon as the first rains fell, we found that the exact same leaks were still active. We had to replace the same drywall that the previous owners disclosed having replaced when they "fixed" the leak. We have also had to rip apart an entire room (wood paneling) to get the framing dry. It's basically been a nightmare. We had roofers come out and confirm that the repairs were done super incorrectly and the whole roof is, to use a technical term, fucked and needs to be replaced now because of this. It seems like we might just be screwed, but does anyone know if we would have any kind of claim against the seller or the guy who did the roof repair? Turns out roofs are super expensive and this is a pretty shitty turn of events. Is it worth talking to a real estate lawyer or is this a situation where we the emptor should have done more caveating? That's kind of where we figured we were. Thanks! That's kind of where we figured we were. Thanks! You didn't inform the inspector of the repairs and ask them to look at it? You didn't hire a roof expert to look over the repairs? You should consult with a local real estate attorney, since you had reason to believe the repairs were done to a reasonable standard, but I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you. I just looked at that report. All it says is condition: avg. What did the inspector say when you had your pre-purchase inspection done?
