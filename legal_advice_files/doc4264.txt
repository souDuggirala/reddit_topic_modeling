 My apt building had a pipe burst on Fri Oct 26th and since then my dog and I haven't been able to live in our unit because 1/3 of the carpet is gone, the bottom foot of the wall/drywall has been taken out and there are holes from my unit into the hallways. I have been emailing them for updates every few days and stating that the unit is uninhabitable since they have contractors coming in and out and debris everywhere. They've offered rent concessions (essentially 1.7 months) if I don't sue them but those will be applied to future payments and my lease is up in a month so it barely helps. I've been so stressed about this. I've called the tenant-housing association in my city and they recommended to file a tenant's assertion and to place the rent in escrow but this is all new legal stuff for me. They've breached the lease then. Either they provide adequate housing, which your rent is paying for. Or you're moving out and expect moving expenses paid for and your full security deposit back. Contacting a housing attorney wouldn't be a bad idea. No, they said they would only pay for the hotel for one night and wouldn't move me to another unit so I've been staying with friends while waiting for them to fix this Did they put you in a hotel, or another unit? What's the problem?
