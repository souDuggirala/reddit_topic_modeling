 For example let's say I worked last Saturday, but I don't work this Saturday. My employer will make me report that I worked this Saturday and not last Saturday. You could be fired, but that's also illegal. You must give your information to file a wage claim, as the state needs to contact your employer and let them know you have done so. There is no way to do it anonymously to have the state audit them. Well, there is, but you need to formally complain for them to try to recover your unpaid wages. You can not be fired for this, and if you are, can sue for wrongful termination. For the Department of Labor to be able to investigate, they will need to know your name and ask your employer for your timecard records. You can't legally be fired for making a claim with the Dept of Labor, but realistically your employer might find a different reason to fire you. If they are doing it so they can avoid paying you overtime, then it is not legal. If so, you can file a wage claim with the department of labor for unpaid overtime.
