  Hey all, Excuse my ignorance as I'm not an expert on copyright law, etc. Here's my situation: I've had success selling merch/apparel online, and I would like to sell work via Printful (print-on-demand service). There are a number of Instagram artists I follow - none of them are particularly popular or famous and typically fit the "starving artist" bill. Would it be possible for me to reach out to them, offer them $XX for the rights to piece of their art, and then slap it on merchandise? My assumption is that I'll have to forward them some time of legal document, etc. What would that process look like? Thanks for your help! That's pretty much it. You'd want to have a lawyer draw up a template contract that you can reuse.
