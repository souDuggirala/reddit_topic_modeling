Hello I am in the middle of a custody battle and my girlfriend of three years just left me. My name is on our lease so there is no imediate threat of me losing my home. I use one of her cars, but I only use it until I can get my own car. My question is will it hurt my chances in court if my son and mother find out me and my girlfriend split.
