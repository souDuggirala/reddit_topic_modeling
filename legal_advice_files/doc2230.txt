 I got a speeding ticket in December 26th, but misplaced the cousin in my car. I got nothing in the mail, but I found the citation today. It specified that I was to appear in court on the 1st (yesterday), but I didn't see that until just now. The court is closed at the moment so there's nobody to talk to when I call. I'm kind of freaking out, what do I do? What can I expect to happen? You should be able to view the ticket online and pay or select if you want to take traffic school. You will need to check the dmv website for the agency that issued the ticket (city, county, or state). Yeah, call the court when able to figure out when your actual court date is. It might not even be in the system yet.  As noted above, unlikely that court would be open on the first of the year, and even less likely that they'd have you have an initial appearance this quickly. But to answer your immediate question, what happens if you fail to appear for a traffic ticket and haven't already entered a written not guilty plea or simply paid it is that the court will enter a default judgment against you and you'll have to pay the ticket. It wouldn't be a huge deal, you'd just lose out on the opportunity to try to get it lowered. Will do, thanks You should call tomorrow, because the 21st is also a court holiday. If you just plan to pay the ticket, or pay it and ask for traffic school, you can do that before your court date. Now that I'm taking a closer look, I think it says the 21st, but my signature slightly obscures the 2 and the cop has shitty handwriting. Either way, I'm not freaking out quite as much. Thank you for making me take a closer look. It's pretty unlikely you would be requested to appear that quickly, or, for that matter, on a court holiday. Are you sure it was for January 1?
