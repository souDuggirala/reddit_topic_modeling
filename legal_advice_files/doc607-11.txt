Moved into a 4BR two months ago and found out after moving in that the building keeps all the trash in the hallways out in the open. This has created a few problems for me and my roommates with the smell, crowding the hallways, and now a rodent problem. The building is managed by a realtor company, we have reached to them several times about this issue but only to have a "request" put in. We also left messages on the building managers voicemail but nothing has happened. I've looked into this and its against sanitation code to keep trash in the "common space" of a building in NYC.

I'm looking for some advice on how to handle this. Call the fire marshal, or whoever is in charge of fire code violations.  This is bound to be a violation.

It might be a good idea to email the fire people some pictures to spur them on to check this ASAP.
