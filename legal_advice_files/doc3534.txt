 Hello! To explain the new account, I’m on a throwaway since coworkers know my main. To keep it short: I worked in a retail store (part time) for a year and about 3 weeks ago, I totally stopped getting shifts, cold turkey. I went from 20 hours a week to nothing. I’ve tried to talk to the manager about it but I get no answer. I was not fired nor have I quit and just would like some advice about it. Is it against the law? Should I just move on and forget about this? Can I even file for unemployment though I was part time and I technically didn’t get fired/quit/laid off? Contact your local unemployment office. If you're "still employed" according to your employer, your benefits may (probably will) be denied.  Constructive dismissal (or constructive discharge) is the term for this and it often qualifies for unemployment benefits. Good luck.  Thanks for answering. I live in South Carolina, btw! I had no idea that you could just get fired with no words, though weirdly enough, I’m still able to log into the workforce as if I’m still employed. I will be filing for unemployment right now. If you’re going to file, file ASAP. Typically you can’t backdate a claim, meaning even if you file and are approved, you’ll only get benefits from the date you filed, not the date you stopped working.  Assuming you’re in the USA you’re fired. File for unemployment and look for a new job
