 I keep getting phone calls from numbers I don't recognize, but they all start with the same six digits of my cell number. My phone often flags them as "Scam Likely", so I ignore them most of the time, no big deal. However, when applying for jobs I started answering all my calls. This one lady was really upset and said she got a call from my number. She recited it to me to be sure, and I checked my logs. There were no outgoing calls. I was freaked out and stopped answering all unknown calls. It's been about a year and I still get these calls multiple times a week. They have started leaving voicemails mostly about lowering interest rates, but today I got a mildly threatening voicemail from someone who obviously is not in on the scam (a pissed off civilian). My phone flagged her as Scam Likely, but she wasn't trying to get my credit card information. She was warning me to stop calling her. She even knew my name, as if she kept getting calls from my number and searched for it online to find me. I am worried that someone will end up suing me for harassment and am wondering if I should file a police report or something or if this is just one of those annoying things I have to live with. TLDR: Scam Likely is framing me for making harassing calls. Ask your phone service provider to change your number, (will get a new sim) tell them about your situation, it should be no problem It's largely trivial for people to spoof a cellphone number. If you actually were investigated for this, the phone company's records would be subpeona'd which would confirm that the calls did not originate from you. Continue ignoring calls from numbers you don't recognize, and don't worry about it. No, a scammer is pinging your phone number to call people local to your area.
