 I am in college and I am in the process of obtaining a restraining order against my roommate based on threats made by him. A little background. From what the police told me, him and I technically have a domestic relationship because we live in the same space. This also does fall under domestic violence charges because he is threatening someone’s like. My question is if I do get this order, I wouldn’t have to move out correct? He would have to comply with the order correct? The school is trying to move me out if I get the order.
