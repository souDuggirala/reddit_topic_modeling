 I went to the ENT to get a deciated septum checked out. So I payed my $60 copay and get in the room. Then the doctor comes in and asks what I need to be checked. I tell him my nose so he does a nose exam which takes 5 minutes with some numbing spray. A few months later I receive a bill in the mail for $80 for being examined. Please, what can I do? Have you called your insurance company? Have you received an EOB (explanation of benefits) from them for that visit? Is that $80 reflected on there as (provider may bill you)? Once you get that answer, you'll know whether it's a correct bill or not. Tests and exams can be billed separately, under different codes, and submitted to insurance at different times. That being said, that usually happens if there's a 3rd party analyzing the tests (essentially a 3rd party lab running blood work etc...). If it is correct, pay it. If it's not, based on what your insurance company has said, call the billing department and ask for clarification. They may have billed you directly for some reason without submitting it to insurance. It happens. All of this is also dependent on the type of insurance you have.  Have you called them to ask what the $80 was for? I recently got something in the mail I thought was a bill. When I finally looked at it a week later I saw it was just an EOB.  The $60 is your copay and the $80 is either for tests, etc., and it's going towards your deductible. If you haven't hit your deductible for the year yet, you'll have to pay it.
