 Landlord threatened to stop my mail if my name isn’t on it. Never had issues with mail before. My real name isn’t on a package coming from China and I let them know ahead of time that she might try to prevent delivery. Is this even legal? She hasn’t specified how she will try to stop it. If she will tell the mail carrier not to deliver, or something. I thought they always delivered to a destination regardless of a name on a package. If its not in your name its not your mail. Mail is used to establish residency, its reasonable she would not want random people not named on the lease establishing residence. If you name isn’t on the package it’s not your mail. And your landlord might be reasonable, should she somehow come into contact with it, to see that package returned to sender as undeliverable.
