 Is it possible to get an ESA letter for a dog without any pre-existing mental disorders. My aunt and uncle have 2 homes that they travel between in the winter months and it is quite the hassle bringing dogs on planes without an ESA letter. Is there a loophole to get an ESA letter? So you want to have the dog designated as an ESA for the sole purpose of skirting flight restrictions? No, there is no way to do that. Prime example of why ESA are considered such a joke to many people. Pay the fees associated with owning animals or drive. No, and you're the reason why actually disabled people have a have a hard time with their service animals.  YTA. Oh whoops, lost redditor here. /s If you don't need an ESA, don't get an ESA letter.  No, accommodations for disabled people are generally not available to people who are not disabled. Handicapped parking spaces are more convenient too. No, there is no loophold to allow them to claim the dog is an ESA just so they can bring them on a plane, they are not entitled to be convenienced in that manner.
