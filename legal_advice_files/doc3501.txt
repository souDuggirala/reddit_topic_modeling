 I wanted to start this off by saying it is my first post here, and this is not actually happening directly to me but to my father. So long story short my dad backed into another car while leaving the mechanics and asked to be put in touch with the owner. So eventually the mechanics calls and gives my father a phone number for the owner and they said they gave the owner my dad's number too. My father has made three calls to the owner over this last week and has not gotten a response, he has also been reaching out to the mechanic. What are my dad's options, he a bit scared the owner might wait or something and claim he made no attempt to contact the owner to fix the problems. Hes a very honest guy and does about everything by the book and just a bit nervous about being screwed over, any help is very appreciated!! Ps this is in Maryland and was in a private parking lot Best he can do is keep track of his phone logs on his attempts to contact or turn it over to his insurance
