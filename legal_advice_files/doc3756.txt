 I was at fault for a car accident a few weeks ago. As I was pulling my insurance information from my email, I noticed that I had missed some messages from Progressive about a missed payment, and that my insurance policy had cancelled due to this just a week prior. My panicked thoughts at the time were to reinstate my insurance as soon as possible, so I did so while police were speaking with the other driver. In order to do this, I electronically signed a statement of no loss without really understanding the full repercussions of doing so. I was notified a few days ago that my claim was denied due to not having an active policy at the time of the accident. I was also told I was to find another insurance company because I had falsely signed the statement of no loss. My question is whether it's likely that Progressive will pursue additional legal action against me, and whether this is something that other insurance companies will be able to see and possibly deny service to me. I admit I made a stupid decision in my panicked state and would like to know what to expect moving forward, as well as the best possible action I can take at the moment. Any advice would be appreciated. They could theoretically sue you for their investigation costs, but this usually doesn't happen. When you apply for insurance elsewhere most companies will ask whether you have ever had a policy cancelled for misrepresentation or fraud (which you have) and will refuse to do business with you. The company could report you for insurance fraud, which is a crime. Whether they will do so no one here can tell you.
