 I’m doing some research on a misdemeanor offense. My state statute states “the offense must be commenced within one year after the commission of the offense.” This particular case has been reset and pushed back several times this year. What exactly does the term “commenced” mean in this context? Since it’s been to court and continued has it already been “commenced”? Once the charges are filed or their is an indictment is made, the Statute of Limitations clock becomes irrelevant. Next there is the “speedy trial” provision of your given jurisdiction. You can assert the right to a speedy trial; although more typically the defendant chooses to waive that timeline.  Once formal charges have been issued, the SoL clock stops. Yes, it means charges must be filed against the individual within one year from the time the offense was committed. Court proceedings and the like, after charges are filed, can generally extend beyond the one year mark.
