 Not sure if this is the right place for this question or not, but here goes: If someone works for the city of Indianapolis, IN in a non police/emergency, or even on-call capacity, can the be forced to utilize a take home vehicle? The reason being is the employees who have take home cars are being taxed twice a year under fringe benefits, however police, fire, and elected officials are not. While the police and other officials are allowed to use their cars for other employment, shopping, etc; the other folks with take home cars are only allowed to drive to and from work, with most people driving around 12 miles round trip to work and back. The tax is unfair, as it comes out of two paychecks to the tune of about $250 to $300, right before the 4th of July.....and the week before Christmas.  By that logic, this department should be included, as they have marked vehicles with lights and police power ID cards.  Cities like to have cop cars on the road even when not in service. It helps prevent crime. It is a benefit to you, the citizen. If you're willing to be a cop, you can get groceries in your car too. The only take home vehicles the fire department has are for the managers, who are salaried, and are going to show up at every major fire that happens, so they need to be in their car all the time. If you're willing to show up at every major fire in your area, you can be a fire chief too.  Can someone force you? No, of course not. Can you be fired for refusing? Absolutely.
