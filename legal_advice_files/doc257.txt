 I sublet from someone who agreed upon a set amount and an agreement that any shareable household item (toilet paper, ect) would be split. I pay the agreed upon amount minus 20$ (less than half) for thing I buy for the house through the month. My roommate and I had a disagreement about his cleanliness and now heâ€™s saying that I owe 50$ more than what I pay (30$ more than the agreed upon amount). No records exists stating what the agreed upon rent was, no emails, no texts, but I have a few months of logged rent in Venmo without complaint. If you are a month-to-month tenant without a lease, your landlord can, unless you're in a jurisdiction with rent control provisions, change your rent upon proper notice. So you don't owe $50 more now. But you will upon his giving you proper notice and expiration of the 30 day notice period required.
