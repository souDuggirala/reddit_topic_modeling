 My wife and I recently had a child and about a month later she decided to get and IUD. Shortly after she starts having some pains on her side which we attribute to the new contraceptive. A month goes by and she is starting have severe pains and we make an appointment to check on it, she doesnâ€™t last that long and we end up in the ER. She has to have surgery to remove the IUD which has punctured her uterus and travels almost to her ribs. She ends up spending the last of her maternity leave recovering. We recently discovered that the makers (Mirena) have a myriad of class action lawsuits for similar cases. Is there any good process we can do for joining these suits? If it make a difference I am in California. Speak to a medical malpractice attorney.
