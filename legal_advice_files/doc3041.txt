 My father passed away in September and left behind 2 vehicles. My sister and I would like to sell the vehicles and need some advice on how to go about this. Here are the details: -he left no will -we are his only children/no wife or SO -we are in Louisiana, but the vehicles are registered in Alabama -both vehicles are physically in Louisiana -Succession has not begun, but my sister and I will be co executors. -2008 Ford Taurus and 2013? Nissan Titan He also owns a manufactured home that is located on a rented lot in Alabama. The Judge of Probate’s office told me that the trailer could be sold without transferring the title into our name, but wasn’t sure about the 2 vehicles.  You guys should have zero problems. Double check the link I posted for more information on the process. You guys covered your bases by making yourselves executors. That would have been the only true roadblock since he didn't have a will. Stuff like this really puts it into perspective as to why one is important. Imagine if some long lost relative tried to come back starting this this and the third? Yes, we do.  [removed]  Once you guys are finalized as executors it's pretty much smooth sailing. You have both titles?
