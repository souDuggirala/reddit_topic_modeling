 I've been working at a pet resort in Florida for the past 8 months. The past 4 months I have been the kennel manager. Recently a very dear friend of mine died and I really needed some time to grieve. Both my supervisor and the owner told me to take whatever time I needed. In the middle of an 8 day leave of absence I had a meeting with my boss thanking her for being so supportive and understanding and that I would return after the funeral. Yesterday I texted her saying I'm ready to come back on Monday and she's claiming that I had quit and she has already hired new people. Nothing was in writing so it's my word against hers. It does not sound like the owner is going to be much help here. I'm really at a loss. I've poured my entire life into this job over the past 8 months and really viewed it as a long term job. I absolutely cannot imagine how anything that was said during my meeting with my boss implied or alluded to me leaving the company. I'm really confused about this situation and how to navigate it. I really want my job back, but if they won't give it to me I'd like to discuss some sort of severance with them. Can anyone help me navigate this?  't give it to me I'd like to discuss some sort of severance with them. Sorry, but that's not happening. FL is an at-will state which means you can be fried for any or even no reason at all (as long as it's not part of a protected class). I'm sorry for your loss, but the death of a friend is not a protected class. They didn't have to hold your position, nor do they owe you severance. File for unemployment and start looking for a new job. Be happy you didn't work there longer considering their true colors.  You can file for unemployment and look for another job. They had no requirement to hold your position, even if they said they would.
