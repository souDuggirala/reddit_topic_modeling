 Long story short I come from an abusive house hold and at 19 chose to leave abruptly after a fight with my parents. When I tried to negotiate with them for a chance to gather my things they were hostile. With naive hope of retaining some form of family relationship I have not gotten law involved, but it's been 4 months and I can not sign any lease paperwork without my identification. All I have to show who I am is my w-2 paperwork and my I-9 paperwork from work. Is their anyway of me being able to get replacements with that paperwork and maybe my bank statement? Or will I have to go in front of a judge and get this handled? Parents will not relinquish my paperwork until I tell them where I currently live, who with, and where I've been. I will not tell them this information for my own personal safety. I feel like I shouldn't have to lie to be able to get my paperwork back. Any help or advice will be vary much appreshiated. I've tried calling the DPS but I only get automated responses and their is never a mention of the paperwork that I have or will need in order to get replacements. I live in Texas and am 19.
