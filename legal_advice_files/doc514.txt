 A civil court case was opened a month ago by my landlord in order to get unpaid rent out of my roommate and I. The case had my and my roommate's name on it, but today I paid the entire amount in full in order for my landlord to dismiss the case altogether. My landlord said the case will be dismissed before the court date (Feb 12th). However, I need to know if the judgement will be removed from my rental history entirely? I am trying to move into a new apartment and when I applied for one, I was accepted until they found the open court case judgement and told me they could not approve me even though I explained the situation. Is this going to continue to happen? Will I ever be able to rent an apartment?
