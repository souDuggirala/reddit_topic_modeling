 Let me elaborate here by giving some backstory, I've been watching a lot of videos of people either plowing through protesters or inching their way through angry road-blocking protest crowds. This has me wondering if there is any legal standing of potential self-defense or a stand your ground type statute protecting people in situations like this. I would have to imagine a court would rule in favor of someone trying to escape (their only escape route being through people and away, instead of away from people alone) and acquit them even if they were charged. So let me throw a hypothetical out there, there you are minding your own business, you drive and run into a crowd, the crowd is growing in numbers and they are all angry violent protesters. You lock your doors, make no effort to inch forward, and you phone the police, but realistically you know it's going to take awhile for the police to be able to disperse the crowd. The crowd see's your political sticker that is anti whatever said crowd is. They start banging on your windows, and smashing your windshield in and have your entire car surrounded, I would imagine anyone in that situation would be in fear of immediate and imminent bodily harm. Any person would also be afraid enough in that situation to find the path of least resistance by driving forward, even if it meant running people over, are there any legal protections in place to help people in a situation like this? and if there aren't, why not? (I assume this is a very particular scenario, so passing some sort of litigation to protect against this would prove difficult.) My mistake, I will post it there, thank you.
