 I liked this guy's art on Instagram and saw that he was selling posters. I wanted to support his work and buy so I sent $60 to his Venmo. He said he'll send me a shipping tracking number in a few days but that was December 29th. It's been 3 weeks and he's basically ghosted me. What should I do? I just want my money back but it seems he has no plans on replying. In New York, NY. Venmo isn't supposed to be used for business payments.  ask around and see if this has happened to anyone else, you might be able to build a case for his store to get taken down Sounds like he scammed you. You could sue him but it’d be more work than what’s it worth. Take the loss  His @? I just wanna talk to him👀🙍‍♀️💁‍♀️. While you're at it, drop yours🤣.
