 About 3 months ago I was pulled over for what the cop said was “speeding”. Going 60 in a 35. He also ticketed me for my tinted windows. I drive a 2017 Toyota 86 with a few cosmetic modifications, with nothing done to the motor, not even exhaust. My car is notoriously slow for a sports car but is known for being heavily modified, so I feel like that alone played a huge part in me being pulled over. I have a tracker in my car that said I was going 33 mph on the street he said he caught me speeding. Not to mention I was also able to physically see the cop about a block away before being pulled over, no one in their right mind would speed past a cop if they can literally see them. I was also coming from a dead stop near the side street he said he caught me speeding by laser. Fortunately I won’t have to appear in court and am given the options to pay the ticket or request a “trail by declaration”, which I’m doing. I’ve gathered all my evidence including the data from my tracker as well as pictures of a traffic cam from where I was stopped, pictures of the street, and the gps mapping from my tracker. Do I have a real shot at fighting this?
