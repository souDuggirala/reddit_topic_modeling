 I don't know if this is the right sub to post this but here it goes. I gave her a copy of everything: license, registration, and the insurance policy at the police station. It was needed so she can get her car fixed at her dealer. Yesterday, she reached out to me because her dealer still wouldn't fix her car because apparently my insurance company won't process the case and that she needed another copy. So I sent her what she needed. Would it be better if I hadn't gave her another copy? Because as far as I know, the case is already settled in my part. (I already contacted my insurance agent about this and I'm currently waiting for their response.)  My new insurance doesn't cover the date when the accident happened, so I sent her the old one. I won't send her the new one if she or someone else claims that it had already expired.  I sent her my old insurance policy because I renewed it just before the New Years. I talked to someone and they said that it's better to send her the old one since it's already voided.  Nah don’t do it. That sounds mega shady.  Idk man... I wouldn’t. You’d think her own insurance company would still have all that. I personally wouldn’t give them my information AGAIN. Buncha creeps out there these days...
