 My roommate sent in our keys in an envelope to my landlord. He told us today that he received an empty envelope that was opened. The landlord has a locked mailbox so they might’ve fell out or something during the mail process. We need them to get the deposit back. What can we do? Ok thank you for this info Yeah it’s more likely it tore than that it was stolen. Keys probably jammed somewhere in mail sorter, removed and thrown out. Landlord might be willing to have new keys cut rather than whole new locks, which would be cheap. Oh ok, yeah. That's the point of deposit. He should give you the difference and not keep all the money. You got to u understand its not your landlord fault either. Maybe get your roommate to pay for the replacement? Is he even on the contract?? Can't send keys in a normal envelope. It's for paper only. The machines would spit it out We aren’t there, I’m asking him how much it’d be to replace them. Possibly use the deposit money to do that then we get the rest Yeah I would’ve padded/wrapped the keys in paper at least but it wasn’t me, was my roommate. I feel like at least I should get the deposit back Thats why you use certified mail with thicker envelope Replace the locks send in new keys lol
