 Thanks for the reply, not sure if the personal dig was necessary but w/e. They were originally on a not so good prepaid plan and their current phone doesn't meet their needs. They discovered I had a decent discount so they asked if I could look into the cost of getting a new phone on my plan with the understanding they would pay for their service and phone payments. It's a new device, nobody owns it outright. It's also worth over $1,000 retail so no I'm not intending it as a gift especially after they verbally agreed to pay for it under my account. If that makes me cheap so be it. I really don't want "breaking up with me" to be a condition for keeping the phone as that sounds like holding the relationship hostage and not particularly healthy, and it's not my intent. I'm just looking to cover myself if they try to bail out on it a couple months from now or something. You're in a romantic or sexual relationship with this person and you're too cheap to GIVE them the phone as a gift? You say you've discussed the arrangement, but it's not clear to me what that arrangement is. I get it that you pay your monthly phone/text/data charges, and the other person pays theirs. But do you expect them to pay the monthly installment for the phone purchase? is it clear that if they break up with you, you keep the phone? If it is, and they walk away from the relationship taking your phone, I guess you treat it like your phone was stolen - call the cops and brick the phone..
