 I was in my first accident on Saturday with my 7 month old in the car. I was turning left at an intersection it was snowy and I had rolled out waited for the cars to pass but it turned yellow. I am very careful especially when my kids are in the car. It was snowing and I remember seeing two cars coming and they had enough time to stop so (obviously I made a mistake) I went. One car stopped and one did not. He hit me really fast and hard. I saw the video on the dash cam of a cop car that was sitting there and the green arrow had come on right at impact so he must have ran the light and was going fast. I was very dazed and only focused on my baby. The cars were moved before I even got out of the ambulance because it’s a busy intersection. My son was perfectly fine. His car seat and my Jeep really help together for him. I have marks on my face from the air bag, bruises where the sit belt hits my chest and hips, my knee is swollen and bruised and I’m obviously very sore. I refused to go to the hospital because the emts said we were fine but of course I’d be sore. I was given a ticket for failure to yield and didn’t really argue it because I thought I was at fault until I saw the dash cam video. The other drive was not given a ticket because they didn’t know the light was ran. Is it worth getting a lawyer ? Should I contest the ticket? My husband went to the police station asking to see the traffic cameras but they were county. So we called there and they said they don’t record from the cameras that are there.
