 Texas. I'm sorry if this isn't applicable to this sub. Short and sweet, I don't see my father often. He's a thoroughly horrible person who has physically abused me most of my life out of resentment for him getting my Mom pregnant, and is crippled by addiction. I am finally old enough to get out on my own, but I didn't have my PO box set up in time for my refund. It got sent to the house, and when I went to collect it, he changed the locks on me to prove a point (even though I co-own the home with my sister). I texted him asking where the key was, and when pressed why, I explained I was here for my mail, specifically my refund. He texted back "I will pay you back for it". Clearly he won't pay me back -- as I write this he just followed it up with "I misremembered. You don't get anything, I claimed you as my dependent" (I'm 23, live independently, and female if that matters) -- but after a life of torment, is this enough for him to have done wrong, with an admission over text for me to get him out of my life with a year or more of time behind bars? He opened my mail, cashed my IRS refund (probably forging my signature). I know this sounds shitty, but if I'm going to burn bridges to really get away and disappear, I need enough time. I don't recall my refund amount to use it, a lot is still in the house. I do know he's lying. Thank you. Can you please go to WheresMyRefund to make sure it arrived in the first place? :  u/lcurnel96 I’m not a lawyer. You’re gonna have to call the IRS, find out why your refund was supposed to be, then call the police, report him for it, then sue him.
