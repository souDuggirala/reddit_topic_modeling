 I am a high school student, and I work at my school doing A/V and IT stuff. I live with my parents and I do not depend on my paycheck. But I am trying to buy my first car, and I will have enough come this next paycheck. I have clocked around 100 hours in the last 3 months, in case you were thinking that I have to get a minimum per paycheck. I have asked nicely to my advisor multiple times explaining my situation, and he seems to put in some sort of a request, but nothing happens. Is their any way I can speed this up (without suing the school district)? Any advice welcome. Thanks in advance! Contract states that I will be paid ($8.15). Below 18 years of age Did you sign anything saying youâ€™d be paid? Are you 18? File a wage complaint with the state department of labor and stop going to work.
