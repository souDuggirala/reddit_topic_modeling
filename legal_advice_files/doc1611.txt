 Have been living with a girlfriend for few years, we own the house together. Ownership 50/50, my name is on the mortgage. We used to pay it (and other bills) together. At some point she became a heavy drinker, stopped working and not showing any signs of improvement. She refuses to get any treatment and when she's drunk she becomes very aggressive. She hides, damages and destroys my personal belongings, house appliances, even doors and locks. For objective reasons I cannot move out immediately or even within few months. 1 Are there any legal options for holding her financially accountable for any damage she makes while we still have to live under the same roof? I constantly have to fix/buy things she trashes. She's not willing to fix, reimburse or even apologize. 2 By paying the whole mortgage from my paycheck I effectively give her few hundred dollars a month - in principal payments. Are there any legal options to force her to pay half (or any part) of mortgage until we sell the house and part our ways?  No, NJ does not recognize common law marriage. Does NJ law consider you a married couple? If yes, you have few options outside of divorce/breaking up. What happens inside bad marriages is generally not actionable.
