 I work for a small business doing IT consulting for about 5 years (some people have been there 10+) and up until now it has been a 9-5 job with occasional, scheduled, after hours work. Today they informed us that the business is "evolving" and they will be offering an after hours, on-call support. We would each be on-call on a 1 week rotation (there are 5 of us). It is voluntary, but if not enough people volunteer, it no longer is voluntary and becomes a mandatory part of the job. The general consensus means that 4 of the 5 of us would have to volunteer, though nothing official. We would get paid $250 flat for being on-call, +$25/hour actually worked. Is it legal for them to change our job description and require us to be on-call when the job we initially took didn't have that requirement?   -call when the job we initially took didn't have that requirement? Yes, unless you have an employment contract or union agreement stating otherwise.
