I got rear-ended at a stoplight, after filling out helping the cops fill out the police report and giving my statement I called for a tow with the number on the back of my insurance card. A tow trucking which was already waiting on scene pulls up to my car and claimed to have been sent by State Farm(which was a lie) and that they were going to tow my car to a State Farm towing lot(also a lie). I let them tow it off only to get a text 15 minutes later from State Farm telling me the real towing truck was coming. 


I googled the name on the receipt and found horrible reviews on Yelp with people claiming they're charged upward of $4500 to retrieve their car. I called State Farm and the operator said this towing company had no affiliation with them. State Farm told me they would sent a towing truck to retrieve it from their lot within 72 hours, but I'm having serious doubts that the State Farm tow will be able to get it since I doubt driver will have that kind of cash on them(apparently they're notorious for refusing to accept credit payments).


So if worst does come to worst and State Farm is unable to retrieve my vehicle, what are my options?  From what I've learned on google, these predatory towing companies operate in kinda gray area of IL law and the reviewers on yelp claimed the police were less than helpful when it came to retrieving their vehicles. Thank you for the advice, I'll take it into consideration. You may want to try to catch this tow company in the act incase it ends up having to go to court I believe this counts as theft due to false pretenses as they lied about what they were doing and who sent them, but I could be wrong.

Report as stolen  Unfortunately, the cops had left by the time they were towing my vehicle. Were the officers still on the scene when they towed your car?
