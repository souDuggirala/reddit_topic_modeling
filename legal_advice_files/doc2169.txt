 I work at a software company in NYC. My co-worker is here on an OPT visa that expires February 11th. They need paperwork from the university they attended to be mailed by then, and the university is saying that could take 2 weeks. There is a feature called E-Verify that we are being told she needs in order to proceed. However, it is not functional during the government shutdown. I would think this will affect tons of people and that many must be looking for resources, if none have been provided already. Any assistance would be much appreciated.  IANAL but I’ve heard that it’s affecting lots of people. Maybe r/immigration will have more advice- I know it’s something different but they might have a few more folks with similar experiences to share They just need the e-verify number when they fill out the i983 form. They don’t need it functioning. Also the application goes to USCIS. With the application is a $410 fee. Meaning that as a fee based operation, the government shut down will not affect processing times.
