 Long time reader, first time poster. Back in fall of 2017 my father sold one of our family friends a cargo van. The vehicle is under my father's name but sold it to our family friend.The sum for the remaining vehicle payment amount was 39.000 dollars. With that being said my father decided to sell the vehicle to them for that owned amount. The family friend gave a 10.000 dollar down payment and the rest they would pay monthly until that 39.000 dollars was paid to the bank then my father would give our family friend the title of the vehicle. Over the past half year that family friend has been late with payments and some months has not even paid yet. Since technically the vehicle is on my fathers name still, he has been paying it becuase if he stops it'll mess with his credit score. Before that family friend purchased the vehicle from us we made a buy/ sell agreement for a motor vehicle. We got a notary stamp and both my father (seller) and family friend (buyer) signed it. On this agreement it has the vehicle information and the acknowledgment of the 10.000 dollar down payment and if the sale is not completed the seller will retain that 10.000 of the down payment of the down payment. With this all being said what actions can my father take because the cargo van is being used every day and the monthly payments are either late or not the full amount. Thank you! Sorry about my formatting first time poster. Anything will help, we don't know what to do. We did not include that because we have know them for twenty plus years. We didnt think it would come down like this.  Does the contract you had notorized specify payment amounts and due dates? If theyâ€™ve violated the terms of the contract then you can initiate repossession process.
