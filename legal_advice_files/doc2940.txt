 My little brother (20m) and his friend (20m) were stopped by a cop as they were searching for our missing dog, forced on their knees and handcuffed. Supposedly someone called in a young black man (my brother) walking with a gun and when they were approached they took off running, none of this is true as he does not own a gun but he did have a long stick, which prompted the cop to pull his gun on them, my brother said no one had approached them while they were walking and he didn’t know where the cop got that from. The cop then just ran their names and let them go. The cop later called my job to ask me where my little brother is, I told him I wasn’t sure as I was at work but I asked what it was about. He told me that my little brother gave him a false birthdate and if he doesn’t contact him immediately he will put out a warrant for his arrest, I asked him to tell me the date of birth he was given...it’s the right date. I told him he had it right but he responded with “well he gave me false info and I need him to contact me” so I said okay and I called my little brother. He was beyond confused and told me he didn’t lie about his birthday and the cop even ran their names and could see his date of birth. He called the police station and the cop told him that he didn’t give him the right date of birth and he would be putting out a warrant for his arrest, my brother argued saying he gave him his correct date of birth but the cop refused to correct his own mistake. Is this at all legal? What should we do in this situation? This is all happening a few weeks after he was arrested for unknowingly concealing stolen property, and he was arrested by the same cop.  It sounds like the cop is trying to create a pretext for getting your brother into the police station. Get a lawyer to sort it out. It will take maybe a phone call or two, not that expensive. Also, it’s better than this cop intimidating your brother over something clearly made up.
