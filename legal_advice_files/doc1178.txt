  So today I received a letter concerning unpaid parking tickets for a car that I sold 8 months ago. Now the problem with this is I sold it to my ex's mother and didnt put a date on the title because I was in a rush and didnt think about it. I also forgot to take of the plates as It was my first time selling a car and i didnt think it was a big deal, oh boy was I wrong. (They live 2 hours away from where I currently live). In response I have decided to take a trip to where the car is located and attempt to retrieve my property, as I do not want any more tickets or to get sued in the event that they get into an accident ( I know for a fact they dont have insurance on it) along with that I have retitled the car in my name as to void the old title and make it so they have no way to dispute the fact that the car belongs to me (with the old title, that I signed). I really didnt want this car as it's a hunk of junk but I cant have them racking up parking tickets in my name or getting in an accident that I'll be liable for. Any advice? I just want to get this car out of their hands and into mine where I know it won't be causing me any problems. Thanks in advance!  Also I just looked it up and according to the WI DMV website it has to be submitted within 30 days of sale date... so I'm not sure if this is an option. Wisconsin, It is still in my name and as I have retitled the car as to void out the title I signed (titles are only good for up to 90 days i believe if not registered within that time frame anyway) they are still using my plates and their is no proof of purchase or sale. What state? Most states you can submit a sold notice to the DMV telling them you sold the car and giving them the buyers info. Some states you can do it online. This is by far your best course of action. If you signed the title over it's legally their car. By taking it back without their permission you would be stealing it.
