 I am a tenant in a condo in Edgewater, New Jersey. Recently, my car has been hit by baseballs from a veterans field next to my condo. Apparently, this has been an issue for many other residents, and the property management has made a guideline on what to do. We report to a police, file an estimate for the repair to the city, and when approved, the city will cover the cost of the repair. First time the car was hit, it left a dent on my car hood. I followed the procedure provided the management group and got it compensated. The second time the car was hit, front windshield was cracked, and replacement was necessary. I got an estimate from safelight, which was $1073.89, filed to the city, and got approved. So i went on, got my windshield repaired, and was waiting for reimbursement from the city. But today, i got a call that the city can no longer pay for it because apparently there was no game scheduled around the incidence, and they cant be responsible for damage caused by random people playing in the field. Is there anything i can do at this point? Do i need to pay out of my pocket? My insurance wont cover it. Also, i asked my property manager and the unit owner to change my parking spot to a different spot away from the baseball field, but they say theres no any other parking spot available (but i see many empty parking spots). Any advice will help me so much. Thank you! INAL. The city can refuse to pay because it wasn't a city sanctioned event. Since you have no idea who hit the ball, there is no one you can go after. It stinks, but that is what it is. You could advocate for either the city or the condo association to put up protective netting, if that's feasible. Yes, pay out of pocket
