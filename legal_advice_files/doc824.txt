 One of my friends is going through a nasty breakup with his wife of 11 years. He returned home yesterday to change vehicles and was served with a Domestic Violence Charge and a restraining order, there are no grounds other than Australia's media blowing up 'Domestic Violence' and local police feeling incredibly pressured to respond to such allegations. She has taken this opportunity to skip town with the children, drop all contact and leave my friend with all of the debts from their marriage. My question for r/legaladvice What are the best options for my friend?
