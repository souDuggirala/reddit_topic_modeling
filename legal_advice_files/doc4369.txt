 Hello there, first time posting on the sub. Ive been stuck with a pretty bad landlord for the last year. Ive never had a working oven,the stove top worked but the oven never has. My fridge wasnt the proper temperature for 3 months, resulting in me throwing out some food and just having to choose not to use my fridge. And the washer broke like 4 months back. It doesnt spin out the water at the end of the cycle so the clothes are literally soaked. Youd have to wring them out by hand before you threw them in the dryer, which results in a $10 drying cycle. I know i should have went to the rentalsman right away but im fairly new to renting and dealing with this kind of stuff. In hindsight id definitely go that route. I was scared hed make my life more difficult. I was planning on just leaving things as is if i got my damage deposit back. Just so I wouldnt have to see his unpleasant face again. But he has repeatedly missed our final walkthrough. I am now going to the rentalsman and trying to get every cent i am owed from him. Since hes not meeting me to grab his key and view the property... Would taking a video of the clean apartment as i leave and lock the key inside be adequate in protecting myself from him saying I damaged anything. I really dont want to meet him.
