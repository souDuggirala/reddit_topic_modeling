 I'm a designer from the UK, and I made a few photos of my designs public a few years ago (think Etsy stuff, but a bit more involved). A US based company took those designs, and built products based around them. I called them out through social media. They denied that they had stolen anything, and claimed that my design was common. This is untrue, but there is no definitive evidence on either side. This is where I made a mistake in anger. I called out their products for their cheap, low quality design. And this received a strong enough response to have influenced some of their buyers. Fast forward a few years, and I'm starting up my own company to sell products based on my designs. Since that point, some of the statements of quality I made have been proven to be true, but some to be unfounded. That leaves me with the fear that the US company could sue my new company for libel, citing monetary losses due to my statements, a decision I fear they will make due to the competition that I pose. Do I have reason to fear? Might have better luck in /r/LegalAdviceUK
