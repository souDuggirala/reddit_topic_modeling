 I bought a $55 dollar pair of pants from a store online called STHEART. Shipping was $6 to receive them. I tried them on and decided I didn’t like them. I emailed them asking how returns worked but they did not reply. I decided I would just return them because they had return instructions on the website. I assumed if they got the pants back, the would HAVE to refund me. Return shipping was not free and I paid another $7.85 to ship them back. All in all, I spent about $68.85 for a $55 refund. I took the loss cause I’d rather have some of my money back than a pair of pants I would never wear. The company received the pants more than a week ago and did not refund me. This was not too concerning, but I thought I would email them, which they never replied again. I decided to direct message them on Instagram, which they never replied. I decided to comment on their latest Instagram post, which the DELETED. What do I even do at this point? If they aren’t will to reply to my messages but will delete my comments on Instagram what can I even do? I’m fearful at this point they are not going to refund me. I sent them the tracking number making it clear I am aware they received my package. If you paid with a credit card/most debit cards/PayPal, you have the option to dispute the charge.
