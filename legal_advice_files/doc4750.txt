 My husband and I just eloped in Jamaica a week ago, legally binding, it was at a resort so they have people who sorted out all the paperwork for us. However our marriage certificate will apparently take “16 weeks” to get to us. I just found out I am 6 weeks pregnant (we weren’t trying but still happy) and I need my husbands health insurance as my current insurance through my work is garbage. We need proof of the marriage as a qualifying life event to add me. THe temporary marriage certificate we got after the ceremony as a placeholder until the official one doesn’t count as an official document. Could we just go get legally married in Missouri this week? Or might that create legal problems down the line since we are already technically legally married in Jamaica? Sorry if this question is dumb. Thanks guys.  Congratulations on your wedding and your pregnancy! Wish you, your husband and baby all the very best for the future! Yea this is pretty standard procedure for ppl with destination weddings. Easier to just get married again than dealing with foreign paper work proving you’re married.

At least that's what I had to do being married abroad, we were always advised to not marry twice but I can't tell if you mean another wedding as in the religious ceremony or the official legal binding.  [removed] ignore the troll. You have a valid question to ask of this sub. Thanks! Relieved! Idk why it was so hard for me to find this myself, all my google results were just re emphasizing that Missouri honors the validity of Jamaican marriage licenses, I couldn’t find anything about getting married in two separate jurisdictions. Thank you!!! We’ll pop on down to the courthouse this week then  I did but all my top results just said that the US honors most foreign marriages which is not my question. And I thought it seemed counterintuitive that you’d be allowed to get married twice. Thx for being a dick tho  [deleted] Yes, you can get legally married even though you're married in another jurisdiction. A lot of people do this when their destination wedding certificate isn't in English.
