 I hope this is in the correct area for this problem. To get things started, my father was on a phone call to his brother (My Uncle) who lives abroad and is frequently in contact with. There has been some tension which has been occurring between other family members (another story) which they were discussing about. My Father was on this phone call at around 11pm with no one to be in sight of him, and he had told me he was speaking in a quiet tone due to the nature of the time and the area that he was in. This is where things become sketchy. The next day comes and my Dad, after work, likes to chill out with his mates to cool down and relax in one of their closest friends house. One of the people that know my father very well, we'll call him J. So J had come up to my Dad and passed on a message from this anonymous person, we'll him A, that A has gotten a recording of my Dad speaking about private family matters and other things. Now like anyone else, my dad freaked the fuck out. Asking me to change his passwords because he was 100% certain that someone had hacked his phone. We do have a possible target for A, however we are not sure what to do and if A will try to do anything to us or my Dad again. I'll update once there is more info.  Thank you  You might have better luck in r/legaladviceuk, then. Your first step in any crime should be reporting it to the police and letting them investigate. All you'll do digging into it on your own is screw up evidence if you happen to find it. I've updated the post  Do you have any sort of a question?  So... What's the legal question?
