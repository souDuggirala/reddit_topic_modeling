 I am potentially thinking about renting a room in a house that my landlords are owning/ paying off. The landlord is also currently planning on living in this house. Is this legal or is there anything wrong with this? Perfectly legal, but landlord-tenant law may vary somewhat when the landlord occupies the property.
