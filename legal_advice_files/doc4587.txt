 I'm at my wits end at this point, any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. On Monday I received a letter from the CCU stating that I owed almost $2,600! These are the steps I've taken so far... 1) I called the CCU to get more information, it was for lapsed insurance on four cars that I haven't owned in a looong time and for an EZ Pass ticket. 2) I called the MVA to get more information on the four cars. The person helping me found proof that I returned the tags on one of the cars looong ago and removed it from the CCU claims (hooray!)... but after looking at the other titles, even admitting that it doesn't look like my handwriting, said they couldn't do anything else about the other three cars. Their best guess is I filled out the title transfers incorrectly? 3) I called EZ-Pass to find out when and where and what car. One of the four cars (unfortunately not the car that was removed), they said the best thing I can do is submit some sort of vehicle history report to prove that I didn't own the car at the time. This is really the least of my problems, it's only $65 out of the now $2020 I supposedly owed. But still rather not pay it if I don't have to. 3) I looked through my papers and got the VIN for two of the cars. The third car was from so long ago I fear I don't have any information about it beyond the make, model and year. What do I do now? I suspect I'm going to have to take a day off from work to physically go to the MVA, but I am not sure how to prove these are not my cars. Please, help and thank you!
