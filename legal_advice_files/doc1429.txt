 Say the cops arrested you at your home for something unrelated to guns or drugs. If there were guns there that you had legally owned, would cops confiscate them? What is the policy on this? Because I know if you are being charged with a crime, or have a felony, etc. then you can't buy them. But what about guns you already own before being charged/arrested? /r/legaladviceofftopic
