 What it says in the title,I'm generally interested due to all the court battles in the video game industry right now. There are several different kinds of intellectual property (copyright, trademark, patent, publicity rights, trade secrets, etc). Each has different rules and the laws differ from one place to another. So your full question is too difficult to answer -- can you be more specific? Also, try /r/legaladviceofftopic for hypothetical situations. What is your specific legal question? Did you receive paperwork stating that you're being sued because of your I.P. address being used to steal/download software? Or did you receive paperwork stating that you're being sued for Intellectual Property violations? If you received court paperwork stating you're being sued - that is the country/state/county/court that you're being sued at.
