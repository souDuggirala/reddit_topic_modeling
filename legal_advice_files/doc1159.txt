 Hello all, I've been dealing with an issue for about 8 months now. Condo managers sent me a sanction letter stating I have not moved my vehicle in time for stall cleaning. I emailed them right away and told them I had moved it within the hour I was suppose to and when I returned home that night my stall was cleaned. I asked if they could rescind the sanction to which they had responded yes. A few months go by and I receive another letter stating I haven't paid my fee. I called the condo managers and explained the situation and was told to send them the emails I have. I sent them the email stating i had moved my car and asking to rescind the fee but couldn't find their response email, so I asked if they could ask the board if they remember this issue or if they could revote on this issue. No response. I called their office again and was told they'll take care of it. Today I got another letter threatening to take me to collections and if they do they will charge me 5x as much as the original amount due to legal fees, and reasonable costs. I emailed the managers all the correspondence I had along with dates and times and spoke directly with a condo board rep. The rep told me theres nothing they could do and just email the managers again. What can I do if they do take me to collections? I live in Alberta, Canada. Thank you in advance! Thank you!  If they take you to collections, tell the collections agency to stop contacting you and that the debt is in dispute. You may have to do this by writing after the collection agency contacts you - make sure you ask them for their procedure. If you do that, the collections agency cannot continue to call you or report the debt to credit agencies. I would nevertheless check your credit report to make sure and contact the credit reporting agencies if anything changes. Then you wait for the managers to sue you. You can cross the next bridge when you get there.
