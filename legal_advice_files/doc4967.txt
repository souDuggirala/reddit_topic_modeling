 This is in Louisiana. I was a month away from 21 and my friends and I were walking to a tailgate. I was only carrying a water in my hand. Two men casually dressed, both older, came up to us and asked for ID’s. They did not identify themselves and they didn’t have badges or anything (at least not visible). Stupidly, I gave them my fake ID because I assumed they were campus police since we were on a college campus. They started scanning ID’s, told me mine was fake, and then began threatening me with jail time. They told me to wait there because they’re going to arrest me and began reading my rights. Then another officer wrote me a ticket with no court date on it. It’s district court so he said they will contact me. Then they told me they were with the ATC and left. Now, here’s the biggest issue. The address on my real license isn’t correct. My parents recently moved and I hadn’t had the money yet to change my address, so I’m assuming the court summons will go to the old address. There are already new owners living in the house so it’s not like I can really talk to anyone about it. I’m very scared. They told me it’s a felony, and I wasn’t even carrying any alcohol. Obviously if I had known they were police I wouldn’t have given them a fake but I was scared and confused and didn’t know they were official anything. They were wearing football shirts and shorts. I can’t be a felon for the rest of my life because of a stupid fake ID. I can’t afford a lawyer, I called the clerk of court and they said the ticket hasn’t even been put in the system yet, that they can’t find it. But to keep checking back because usually it can take up to 6 months (this happened three months ago). It was a stupid mistake but I didn’t know any better and I don’t believe I deserve to be a felon for this. I’m just a dumb college student, I had no idea. Obviously I’ll never do this again (don’t need to anymore since I’m now 21 regardless), but I’m not a bad kid. I’ve never been convicted of anything. I’ve gotten a break tag ticket and a headlight ticket but that’s it. Can anyone help me? Thanks in advanced  Everyone asks me that and honestly, the best answer I can give is that I was just intimidated. He asked for all of our ID’s, I was freaked out, so I just foolishly gave him my fake, assuming he was a volunteer or a parent or something. They had “[college’s name] dad!” and a football gear. My friends were holding alcohol (they were over 21) so I guess I was just doing what they did. Why would present them a fake id if you weren't holding alcohol? As for legal ramifications possession of a fake id isn't illegal in Louisiana its illegal to use a fake id to buy alcohol though its only a misdemeanor. The only way it could be a felony is if you use the id to avoid getting caught for something like if you were pulled over and presented the cop your fake id instead of a real id that would be a felony. If you can't afford a lawyer you will get a public defender as this is a criminal case with the possibility of jail time.  That's why you need an attorney my dude, an advocate for you who knows how to work the system. yes, if the charges have not yet been entered or formally filed It says no records found. Is that normal? The link says I can’t be fined more than $500 or imprisoned for more than 6 months, or both. I’m not sure if that relieves me or stresses me out even more. 😓 Is a public defender an actual option?  I'd speak to the public defender's office if at all possible and get some guidance here. It isn't a given that you're entitled to their services because it's possible that they won't be seeking jail time for this offense. You should at a minimum go to your state/county bar association website and get some referrals for criminal defense attorneys. Many will give inexpensive consultations and they can help you get a sense of what to expect, how to move forward, etc. You do not want another charge tacked on for failing to update your license. The ticket says “possession of a fraudulent document for identification purposes.” My parents live in another town. My mom is poor and my dad doesn’t talk to me anymore so I don’t really have their help unfortunately I talked with an attorney who was a patron at my bar. He said he’ll charge me $700 to take on the case, and will set me up with a payment plan. He told me at best I will just have to pay fees to the state and do community service. But I that I do need an attorney. I’m extremely broke so I don’t have the money upfront, but I’m willing to do a payment plan if the monthly is low enough. Do you think that is a reasonable price? Or should I just get a public defender since it’s provided for me? You aren't a kid and that argument is not likely going to help you. What did they actually charge you with? [Mere possession is not a felony in LA](). How long ago did the parents move? Can your parents help you get a lawyer? I’m not sure if it does but I can definitely check. This whole thing is really embarrassing because I was so stupid. My mom doesn’t have any money and my dad doesn’t talk to me so it looks like I’m on my own here. Thanks for your input  Keep checking the court's website How will I be able to find out my court date?   You could go to jail. Hire an attorney. Continue to keep checking with the clerk of the court. Does your college have a law school attached to it? Is there a service offering legal aid to students? If there isn't, and if you're charged, you will need to get a public defender unless your parents can afford to pay for a lawyer for you. Make sure you get the address on your license changed ASAP. You need to figure out a way to get an attorney. If you can't get one, when you find out your court date ask for a public defender at your first appearance
