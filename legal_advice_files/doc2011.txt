 According to [this post](), publishers are required to disclose changes to a textbook between editions. The textbook in question was published by "A" as edition n. Edition n+1 is with publisher "B." Is this a loophole, or is publisher "B" still required to give a list of changes made from edition n to n+1? Why are you asking? Any legitimate textbook publisher has legal resources and should know what to do. I own the nth edition and want to know if the n+1 edition offers new information or if the changes are all fluff. Textbooks are just so expensive and I know that some circumstances allow for older editions. I can't find that information if they don't have to give it. But the publishing company changed and I dont know if it holds the new company accountable for revisions made from a book published by another company. It is difficult to explain and also avoid giving identifying information. Thank you for your time and for highlighting the law for me! [Concerning the HEOA, the DOE states]() : When textbook publishers provide information on a college textbook or supplemental material to faculty in charge of selecting course materials at postsecondary institutions, that information must be in writing (including electronic communication) and must include : ;  ;  a description of substantial content revisions;  whether the textbook is available in other formats and if so, the price to the institution and to the general public;  the separate prices of textbooks unbundled from supplemental material;  to the maximum extent possible, the same information for custom textbooks. I think some context as to why you're asking this would be helpful in answering your question.
