 My older brother and his new baby momma moved into my mom's place where I also reside. They refuse to get a job (while I spend 600-1000 monthly to help my mom) and the house is constantly a mess I wake up at about 4 am with no dirty dishes and get home before anyone else with a full sink of dishes which my mom cleans almost daily after work. I made a complaint and it went out of control to the point where he said I'm not allowed to speak to his children and even if it "hurts" his child he will drag him out of the room. He hasn't been to court and they just split weeks. Unfortunately it would normally come to blows (I have an advantage) but I'm already in trouble with the law. I really want to know if he has the legal right to refuse even talking to him while he brings my nephew into the house I lived in about 5 months before he even seen it and call the police because of it. Sorry for any grammar errors I'm chain smoking cigarettes to avoid assaulting him in freezing weather. I'm in Texas and the kids are 3 and 10 months.  Can they get a restraining order if the person I'm being restrained from is being let in the house where I live? If a restraining order gets file against you, yes. If you continue to go against the parents' wishes in regards to their child, they can likely easily get a restraining order. You don't have any right to talk to someone else's child. I doubt the police are going to come out over you just talking to a kid though.  But can their be legal penalties for conversation between me and him? You have no legal rights to his kids You have no legal right to have access to your nephew.
