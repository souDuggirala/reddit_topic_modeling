 I (19m) was going out of town this past week and was going 80mph on a 70mph, and I was stopped by a sheriff who wrote up a citation, telling me to contact the judge by jan 11th. This is my first ticket, how would I go about this with minimal effect on my driving record/finances?  I've seen the traffic school work but I didn't want to miss work and be there for 8 hours. So I got a lawyer and paid the court fines and legal fees with no points. Turned out to be like $450 total. But with you being young traffic school may work. Don't just pay the ticket though. Because your insurance will go up possibly $100 more monthly. I have a friend that got a ticket at 19 doing 85 in a 70 and he was paying $400 a month because his car was considered a sports cars because it was a 2 door Honda. It was more than his car payment.

If it is your first ticket, usually you can go to traffic school and get no points, but without knowing exactly where you are I cannot give better advice. This is going to depend on where you are.ï»¿  You can show up and ask for leniency.
