 Exactly my plan! Just do some preparation without making it obvious you’re packing, set a date and time when you think she might not be there, schedule some friends to help if you can, and GTFO all at once and don’t look back. Good luck.  Exactly. These are all things I'm trying to avoid. Haha. Good call. Just be sure to set up the new place so that when you tell her, you’re ready to move. Not that she has any legal recourse to make you stay or pay another month of rent, just to avoid her flipping out, potentially breaking your things, or other unpleasantness. No, I did not. I don't want any money. I just want out of crazy town. If you have no lease on paper, I would assume you are in an informal month to month, agreement, meaning you could leave at any time. I doubt you could get any portion of rent back if you left before the end of the month, though. Did you pay a deposit? Is that ethically speaking I should let her know or legally speaking? Thanks for the reply.  If there is nothing on paper you have no obligation to do anything in particular, but I would let her know as soon as you are 100% sure you have your next place lined up and you’re ready to go.
