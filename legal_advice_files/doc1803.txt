  I bought a driving package which consists of 6 lesson which cost $595 total. The lessons were Lesson 1: Basic DrivingThis lesson is used to determine if the driver can control the vehicle safely. Lesson 2: Arterial DrivingThis lesson is used to determine if the driver understands signs, signals, and pavement markings. Lesson 3: ParkingThis lesson covers hill parking, parallel parking, and backing around a corner. Lesson 4: Freeway DrivingThis lesson covers freeway driving including entering, exiting, merging, and lane changing. Lesson 5: Pre-testThis lesson tests drivers on arterial driving, lane changing, parking maneuvers, and response to controlled and uncontrolled intersections. Lesson 6: Skills ImprovementThis lesson covers the skills that driver's need to prepare for the Washington State Department of Licensing test. The package was extremely misleading and I only have learned basic driving. I did not learn how to parallel park and drive on the freeway. On the final lesson the instructor shorted me by 10 minutes and insist that I pat for another 6 lessons and then see how I would do, only this time it is cheaper because I have some sort of experience. I want to purse some legal action,complain about the package to the driving school or just leave it be?
