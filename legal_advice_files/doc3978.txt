 My partner and I are starting a new business and had negotiated and agreed upon a list of landlords work in our lease. Part of this was to remove the existing carpeting. When we were informed the work was done and went in to inspect, the carpet was indeed removed but there is still 1200 sq ft of old, hardened carpet glue/adhesive on top of the concrete floor. I contacted the landlord via email and this was our exchange: Me: the carpet top has been removed but the carpet glue has not. When can you schedule it to be removed? LL: carpet glue on concrete remains. The intent is for your flooring to be put on top of the existing concrete. Your flooring guys deal with leftover glue regularly” So basically what I’m getting out of that exchange is that he doesn’t want to have the carpet glue removed. In the lease under landlords work it states “Remove carpeting in its entirety”. Is carpet glue/adhesive included in “carpeting in its entirety”? This is specific to Ontario, Canada. Any help would be greatly appreciated. It’s our first business and first time dealing with commercial leases. We want to maintain a good relationship with the LL and all of our interactions thus far have been professional and courteous with him.  Yes I do. We can make changes to the floor with the knowledge that if the landlord wants the floor back to how it was then we must comply before the end of our lease.  Do you have permission to stain or paint the concrete? That would be a permanent modification.  No I’m not. I plan to either stain or paint the concrete. Are you putting new flooring down?
