 I’m separating from my spouse because he’s a serial cheater and has a really bad temper. We will get divorced sooner or later but haven’t planned that yet. We live in an apartment in New York City with a lease that expires in March. He’s agreed to move out next week. FWIW the apartment is rent-stabilized and managed by a large corporation. I paid the whole year of rent in advance already when we moved in. The leasing agent at my landlord told me it’s impossible to remove my wayward spouse from the lease even if he consents (and he will consent — he’s cooperating) because it’s a legally binding contract and it’s complicated due to NY rent stabilization laws. Is this correct? It seems kind of ridiculous that I (or any other separated/divorced individual) would have to endure the risk of an angry ex having unlimited legal access to my apartment. I don’t think that he will try to gain access, but is sure feel a lot more comfortable if he cannot get access. Thank you for your thoughts. Okay, thank you for clarifying. The landlord does not have to release anybody from the lease if he doesn't want to. It's really immaterial whether he can't or he won't. If he doesn't want to, he doesn't have to. Thank you. So I just need the landlord to cooperate and agree to remove him? Or they legally can not remove him even if he’s consenting (due to rent stabilization)? Yes he agrees. The landlord said that doesn’t matter.  Correct enough. It certainly is complicated by rent stabilization. In broad terms landlord need not necessarily agree to a change in the lease you propose (unless perhaps the rent stabilization requires that of him). Does he agree that he wants off the lease?
