 Hi, Quick rundown of events. Ex-girlfriend (19) and I (19) that were in a toxic relationship saw each other recently and started talking again. We started meeting up and hooking up. A couple nights ago we got in a fight, both of us hit each other. She started shouting and her mom came out of the room. They called the cops, I patiently waited to explain what had happened to the cops. I ended up just telling the cop of what had happened that night, told him that we both hit each other. I got arrested, my bail was posted, and here I am now. My first court appearance is this Tuesday. Do I get a lawyer? Did I make a mistake by admitting to what happened that night to the cop? I'm overwhelmed. Get a lawyer and I'd go one further and delete your post. This is one of those don't talk to the police situations.  Yes you made a mistake. From what it sounds like you admitted to committing battery. If she was attacking you self defense might be an option, but from what it sounds like it's going to be a hard sell. Get a lawyer ASAP and follow their advice. Also, don't hit people unless it's absolutely necessary to protect yourself You absolutely need an attorney. It's not advisable to give statements to the police, especially ones that involve having battered someone.  Get a lawyer and tell them exactly what happened. They will tell you what to do.
