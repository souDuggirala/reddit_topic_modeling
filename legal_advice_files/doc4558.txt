 I was picking up an online order and while I was inspecting the product, the employee asked, "and the iPad as well?" Just then, I noticed her placing a brand new iPad in my shopping bag and all I could think to say was "uhh, yeah that's fine." I high-tailed it out of the store and went home to contemplate my life. This all happened yesterday and I am unsure of what to do. I've left it un-touched in my bedroom just in case my conscience takes over, or if the store calls me back. If the store realized their mistake can they look up my info to come after me? Could they charge me $350+ after the fact? They typically wouldn't charge you the cost of it so much as contact the police since what you described is theft  You stole an iPad. It wasn't free, it was a mistake and you knew you didn't order it. They can review the pickups, video, and go to the police. Return it. If someone found a wallet on the ground and asked "Is this yours?" and you said yes do you think you got a free wallet? Would you start using the credit cards because finders keepers? You need to return it before they realize their mistake and maybe get the police involved. Everything is on video tape and someone is missing their iPad.  You realize if they go back in that tape, not only is the employee screwed, but you'll be on the hook too.
