 So I got ticketed by the Downey PD in Downey California claiming that I was driving 58 on a 40. To keep things short, I'm certain that I wasn't speeding and me driving a loud Mustang and making eye contact with him as I drove past his motorcycle definitely played a role. Anyways, I do plan to contest this in court and I plan to be as courteous as possible yet stand my ground and push for my innocence. What are some SPECIFIC phrases that the judge would like to hear? Like what are the golden words? My hearing is on January 3rd so I plan to greet everyone a happy holidays. I also plan to say "the officer was very professional and respectful however I do disagree with his judgement that day". Any strategy/golden words would help. Thanks!
