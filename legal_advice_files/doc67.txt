 So I worked at Walmart for over a month and received my first paycheck fine, the second two never came though it says it did in their system. They owe me over $800 for the work and I've called multiple times asking for assistance by human resources payroll without any luck, mostly they just told me I would receive it soon. Finally around a month after quitting and almost 2 months past when I should've originally got paid I went in person and was told to call corporate. Called corporate today who told me to speak to my district manager the same person who had told me to call corporate previously. Do I have a case to sue? I'm in PA  The state investigates, comes to a conclusion, and generally makes the company pay what it owes to employees. You've been going around in circles with them for three damn months. Your mom is not going to solve this, and she has no legal standing. Let the State of Pennsylvania take care of this for you... moms are great, but PA is more powerful. I plan on talking to them tonight with my mom, I never done this before, do you know how this usually goes? the process? File a [wage claim]() with your state.
