 This past Summer, my boyfriend put my sister and I on his TMobile account and financed two Galaxy S9 phones for us. They were being paid off but she started refusing to pay her portion. Then she left Michigan to go to South Carolina and she took that phone with her despite him requesting it back. I do have the evidence via screenshots and messages that she has it. I even have the imei and such. We've requested it back numerous times and she's responded violently and mockingly. Mostly, I want to scare her into just sending it. I've already told her we have a lawyer and I've told her she'll be hearing from them. If I don't get something official sounding, she isn't gonna do anything to get it back. I'd rather avoid having yo go through the process of suing her but the phone wasn't even close to paid off and wasn't in her name and she wasn't welcome to just steal it. What can I do? I work at a phone carrier corporate store. Call the carrier and report the phone lost or stolen first of all. She won't be able to use it on that carrier again because it's blacklisted. Unfortunately because the account owner signed a form at the store agreeing to pay the amount, I can tell you the company won't be able to help. You may be able to file a police report but I'm not sure if anything would come of it.  It's already been deactivated, but she's been using it on WiFi. It's a used $800 phone, which is worth considerably less, so keep that in mind for any legal actions. Your bf only entitled to the used value. It's a phone on his account. He can deactivate it if he wants, making it considerably less useful to your sister. It will not be worth the effort to sue and attempt to collect from someone so far away. You could pay an attorney to write a demand letter, it might convince her to return it.
