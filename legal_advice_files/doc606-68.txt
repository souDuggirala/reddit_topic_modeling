What laws apply here? Are the laws in my state where this was filed, the laws where the filer lives, only federal laws, or a combination of the above apply?

What other differences if any are there between the two? Mainly in regards to the parol evidence rule, frivolous litigation, financial fraud, etc it's only federal because of jurisdiction but thank you for that bit of insight Federal court = shut the fuck up and get an attorney. Immediately. 

There is no other useful advice this sub will give you. Choice of law law is complicated. Litigating in federal court proceeds according to the federal rules of civil procedure but using the laws of a state as determined by the rules for choice of law. 

If you are being sued in federal court that is the big league so getting a good lawyer is your first step.  [deleted] You're going to need an attorney. What you are asking goes beyond this sub
