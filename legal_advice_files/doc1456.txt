 I Googled whether this was illegal and I got a lot of articles with tips on how to hide money before a divorce and a few articles that said while it is illegal, it is highly effective and common. Didn't really find any articles that were more explicit about this situation. If I accept this transfer, my account would be under legal scrutiny during the divorce right? I don't want to endanger myself. But also how would this ever work? There's a paper trail one way or the other isn't there?

Notorious worst law school in the country Not only would you be participating in fraud if it was a large enough sum you could be called to testify that that transfer was a gift, so perjury too. Plus if the judge finds mom was trying to hide funds they often give 100% to the aggrieved spouse (not the 50% they were entitled to) I can't see how effective it would be when bank statements would show large cash withdrawals.  I get that. But it’s not like she’s asking her to commit a murder.  Don't do it. You could open yourself up to a lot of problems, one being a nice felony on your record forever. Seems to make sense, given that mom is asking her to participate in fraud.  Her bank records would be pulled. The attempt to hide assets would be found. You and she would be fucked.   Hiding assets during a divorce is a form of fraud. Being an accessory to fraud is a crime. Don't do it. Wow you trust reddit more than your own mother. That’s brave.
