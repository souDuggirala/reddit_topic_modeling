 Our landlord charges a pest control fee as part of the rent. It isn't much, I think somewhere around $5/mo, but it's incredibly frustrating when we are being charged for it despite seeing cockroaches getting into our apartment and elsewhere on the property. We have put in multiple maintenance requests in the past month to have the exterminator come to our apartment, and he sprayed all the typical places (cracks under doors, fireplace, behind appliances, under sinks, etc.). While we aren't exactly neat freaks, but we keep our apartment relatively clean and the exterminator told us that we are more than clean enough that we shouldn't be seeing them inside. He also stated that there was a lack of evidence to make him believe we had an infestation. We have seen them outside the building quite several times as well, leading me to believe (though I can't prove it) that the management is simply neglecting the property while continuing to charge tenants fees. We're going tomorrow morning to talk with the leasing office staff, but I'm curious what pur options are legally should it come to that. Has anybody else dealt with something similar? I have not, thank goodness (terrified of roaches!), but once you mention it to the office - if they do nothing more about it (than the already, “not working” steps) then see if you can put your rent into escrow until it’s solved? I’m not a lawyer, but I have used rent escrow to get issues resolved in the past.
