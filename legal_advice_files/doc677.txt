 Sorry, I don't have any idea on this topic. I'm extremely stressed with work right now so I want to get some advice on this. Step brother hit his mother and she called the cops (stupid stuff). The cops came and asked if she wants to place a charge on her son, which she asked her son if he wants to be charged and stupidly he said yes. Now some mail came about the demographics of the son and the signatures and all that court stuff. Now they decide that they don't want to continue this case because it was initiated on anger and stupidity. I called the guys who sent the mail and they said the charge was initiated by the cops or something (I forgot) but I didn't get a chance to ask if we can actually drop it. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks. If this helps, we live in Georgia. Thanks, I did some searches on Google but I guess I didn't enter in the right keywords to find what I'm looking for .-. Generally if the victim isn't cooperative low-level charges will be dropped simply because it isn't worth trying to make a case without the victim's statement. Domestic violence is different though. DV victims regularly recant their statements after the fact, and in many jurisdictions those charges will be pressed by the state regardless. Probably not for these types of charges but maybe. If stepmom wants to try she can contact the DA.
