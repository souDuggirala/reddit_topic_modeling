 Ok so I’ve lived in my current apartment for two years now and my current lease ends on February 13, 2019, I have already signed a lease renewal which obviously becomes effective on the 13th of February. The new lease had a new addendum that doesn’t allow smoke anywhere on the property, I was not aware of this, while I was signing the new lease online on my phone I got a pop up asking if I agreed to the smoking policy, the way the question and possible clickable answers were worded it made it sound like there was no smoking allowed inside the units. I smoke on my patio, I have two jobs so it’s not like I sit out there and chain smoke all day. So I clicked that yes I’m a smoker but would abide by the policy, there was no option to actually view the policy. So I get an email yesterday reminding everyone that we are a 100% smoke free complex. None inside and none outside anywhere on the property. Seriously, I’ve never been presented this actual policy. My question is not if they can do that, I know they legally can. My questions are 1) since this addendum was attached to my new lease, does it go into effect immediately or on the 13th when my old lease ends since this was not in my original lease or last years renewal? And 2) since I was never actually given the policy itself can I get out of my impending 15 month lease that I just signed? I feel like I was duped. Yes, I know smoking is bad, yes I know it smells, I’m not here for a lecture, I’m here to answer to those two questions.  So I’ve been dressing in my worst pajamas and going out to the sidewalk right by the entrance to smoke. I’ll probably camp out there on my weekend mornings off to just look as trashy as possible. I still feel duped, but I’m following the guidelines by not smoking on the property.  Thank you. That’s the answer I was expecting.   No, you were warned of the smoking policy in the lease, if you didn't know what that policy was you needed to check before signing.
