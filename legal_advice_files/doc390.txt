 Biological dad signed over his rights due to not wanting to pay child support, this was July or August of last year. We have all the paperwork in order for an adoption of the child. Final court date is in 3 days, we just need a paper from him saying he’s aware of the court date, he doesn’t want to sign it and he seems to have changed his tune. What can he do at this point?  Okay, thank you  The statute in WA for uncontested termination and adoption states the relinquishing parent has to.either sign the waiver of notice of hearing or must appear in person at the hearing.  I don't know the rules in your state about revoking a relinquishment of parental rights. Some states make it much harder than others. If he can revoke it, then yes, that would probably be when he pops up a d fights it.  He said he I’ll get back to us before the morning, but it sounds like he won’t show and won’t sign. We were told if that happens then the date will be rescheduled for 24 days later. I’m assuming at that point he can fight for his rights to not be taken away even after signing them over? I’m at work at the moment, but my wife told me we need either him at the court date or a paper signed by him. And if we can’t get either then the date will be rescheduled for 24 days later. I will look into that though, thank you.  So he won't sign the waiver of notice of hearing? In that case, it looks like from the statute that he will need to appear at the hearing in person. If he won't sign and he won't appear, you will have to take.other steps to try to move the matter forward, such as maybe doing this as a contested termination and adoption, for example.  Are you sure you need him to sign? Normally for court you just need "proof of service" which is just you signing a paper saying that you sent him notice of the hearing using one of the approved methods. Disclaimer: NAL and I have never been involved in an adoption.
