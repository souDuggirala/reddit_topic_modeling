My father in law passed away last year. He owned an assortment of hand guns. We never found his Will. My husband now has the guns but we are unsure of how to go about getting them legally registered too him, so that we may own them or sell them threw the proper channels. Any advice is appreciated! 
We are located in Pennsylvania.  The Sheriff's Department or a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) is the way to transfer the ownership. Your husband (assuming he's the one taking ownership) will have a background check run on him same as if he was purchasing the weapons. Once transfer is complete, he can keep or sell the guns as he pleases (and under legally allowed processes in PA). There is no gun registry in PA, and in fact Pennsylvania law makes it illegal for the government to form a registry (18 Pa.C.S. ยง 6111.4). 

(EDIT)
Haha! Wait! English! Your father-in-law is your husband's dad!

Okay. In that case I'd give the Sheriffs a quick call and double-check with them that there's no problem with an intra-familial transfer in this scenario. Having no will makes it a bit less explicit (and there is a PA code specifically dealing with transfer of firearms as part of an estate) but if the guns can be demonstrated to have belonged to your husband's father (and I assume your husband will have little difficulty proving that he is his dad's son) then it should all go smoothly. Might not even need an intermediary. But it's wise to check.


(EDIT 2)
I swear I'll figure out how to spell Sheriff one day.
