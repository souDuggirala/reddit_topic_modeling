 I'm still kind of reeling from this so I haven't really done anything so far. My wife wanted to contact the dealership and leave some bad reviews, told her not to until we can figure out if we might have a case. We went in to find out about trading in our 2013 Jetta, they checked the Carfax and told us that it was in a major accident, which I believe happened right around the time we bought it. We were never given that information at any point in the transaction. Basically I'm wondering what my first steps should be. I've checked the paperwork we got from them, and it doesn't say anywhere that it was a rebuilt title. I was probably going to check with the bank to see if the title they've got says it's rebuilt, but I'm worried that something might happen with the financing if the title they have is clean when it apparently shouldn't be. I know Many cars get imported to Utah as I guess your guises Title donâ€™t get branded salvage. So not sure, I think you should have been advised that it was involved in an accident not sure if that is required given your laws, may I ask what you have done?
