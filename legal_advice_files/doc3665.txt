 I have just received a letter through from the hmrc (english tax office) to say i owe nearly £700 from company car tax My last company was charging me £25 a month for a company car which i constantly questioned and was told to ignore Do i have any legal standing on this to try and get the money from my old company?  /r/LegalAdviceUK would be better.
