 I currently am receiving medical insurance through my parent's insurance until my 26th birthday (two years from now). When I turned 18 my parent's plan no longer covered dental. I am now in need of some extensive dental care which is going to be costly. There is a local federally funded dental office that uses a sliding pay scale for dental procedures. However, I am recently married and it will affect "my" income. The dental office can no longer use the sliding pay scale based on my personal income because my spouse makes outside the limits. My spouse and I do not share assets, we do not have joint bank accounts and he is not responsible for my health care. We keep everything monetary separate. I would be eligible for benefits if my husband's income was not counted. I know when doing Medicaid applications for my job (I work in the legal field but, don't focus on Medicaid law), which is rare, we have clients sign a Spousal Refusal Affidavit stating something along the following: I refuse to contribute any of my income or resources towards the cost of my said spouseâ€™s medical care. I hereby request that the ------ County Department of Social Services consider the income of my spouse alone in determining his eligibility for Medicaid, as dictated by Social Services Law, Section 366. Is there something similar I can do to qualify for this federally funded dental office sliding pay scale?
