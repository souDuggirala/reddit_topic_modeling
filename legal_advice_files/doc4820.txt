 Fathers friend has had our gun for well over a year. Orginally we gave it to him because he is a gunsmith and was fixing it up but every time ive tried calling and texting him he forwarded me and gave me the same excuses. Basically what im getting at is how would i go about getting it back? My bad ive only had the chance to hold it once as it malfunctioned in the first week of having it. Thank you for the advice. I will be filing a report soon.  First, its an AR-15. An M4 would require an M16 lower receiver manufactured before the mid 1980s, and a tax stamp. This is an important distinction, because if it were an M4, it would be a federal crime. Second, contact your local PD and file a police report.  [removed]
