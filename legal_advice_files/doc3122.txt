 I am 21 M and my parents just told be they want power of attorney over me incase I was in the hospital and couldnâ€™t consent to treatment. Currently there is nobody other then the court that could chose for me. I think they have a valid point, what do you all think? Also: assuming I eventually get married, would my parents lose the power? Or would there need to be an amendment. I would rather my wife have power instead of my parents once I am married. Additional info. I am in college and single. I have never had any major medical complications (knock on wood). They just randomly brought this up during Christmas.
