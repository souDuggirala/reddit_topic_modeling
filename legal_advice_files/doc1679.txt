 Hi legal advice fam, Long story short, my grandmother died last week and her children are in the process of cleaning up her house, debts, and everything else related to a death. I wasn’t close to this woman, and can say she was a real monster of a person. This brings me to a conversation my aunt and I had today about my OWN mother. My mother is also a terrible person, years of neglect towards me when I was a child, and I’ve had extremely minimal contact with her over the last 10-15 years. My Aunt mentioned I should take a life insurance policy out on her in case she dies so the clean up monetarily is covered. Here’s my question - As I am the oldest of two sons from my mother, I’m 30, my brother is 11, am I responsible for my mother’s estate or lackthereof when she dies? I literally want NOTHING to do with her or anything she’s gotten herself into. And especially don’t want to deal with anything related her funeral costs. I also do not want to throw money at a life insurance policy for someone I don’t care about UNLESS I can somehow be held financially responsible somehow. Her residence is in Texas, I don’t know if that matters or not. Let me know your thoughts! Thanks for the help.  If you are named as executor of the estate you can decline. You do not inherit her debts. I don’t know why you would buy life insurance on your mother. It’s a waste of money.  Anyone can take out a life insurance policy on anyone. However life insurance is paid out to the designated recipient, and has nothing to do with the person's estate. In your case your mother's estate would not benefit from said insurance unless it was explicitly designated as a beneficiary. Relatives are also not responsible for the decedent's debts. The only exception would be for things like co-owned debt. If there are any assets to be divided up the estate's debts would need to be settled prior to any distribution. Nope, you're not responsible for her debts.
