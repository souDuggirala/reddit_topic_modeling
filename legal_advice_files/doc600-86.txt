When we were moving out we asked the owners if we could leave some furniture becuase we didn't have enough space to move it. When we returned the next day they said to not come back or they would call the police. What should I do? You could try calling the police and seeing if you could get a civil standby so you can retrieve your property.  You could also sue for the value or return of the items.  Keep in mind, doing so may blow back on you, because if you're things are there, you may still be considered a tenant so you may end up owing additional rent. No Do you have proof they gave you permission to keep things there? Officially  Had you officially moved out, or was there still time left on the lease?
