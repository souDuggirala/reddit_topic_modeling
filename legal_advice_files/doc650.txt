 Hello, I was arrested on Friday evening at a casino for public intoxication. I was drawing too much attention to an area where someone was being taken out on a stretcher. Two security staff walked me outside where I exchanged heated words with them while I was waiting for a Lyft ride. Before the ride came a police officer arrested me outside in the waiting area. I do have a general recollection of all the events through the rest of the evening and am fairly positive I wasn't administered a breathalyzer. I do have a lawyer already and have alcohol related prior convictions, the most recent being over two and a half years ago. My questions are: Is there a chance of arguing that the parking lot of a casino isn't a public area? and are they still able to prove intoxication and convict me without a bac reading? I'm going to guess: No and Yes. Thank you for any assistance or comments.  The thing to learn from this is that you clearly have issues handling alcohol and need to stop drinking it. Thank you, I was hoping to learn of some better arguments if there are any You'd be guessing right. Sounds like you were publicly intoxicated, and that's how you're being charged, so this is largely appropriate and you'll need an attorney to make better arguments and try to strike a deal.
