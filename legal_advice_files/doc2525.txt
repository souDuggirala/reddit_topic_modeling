 I know this might sound crazy because for the first 7 years it did to me as well. Ever since 2010 I have had people say random weird things to me and have had the train's horn go off whenever I type something on Social Media. At first I thought wow I must be crazy so I went to the mental hospital twice and have been on medication that for the most part has kept me stable. However it has not stopped. The things I see when I go to my job twice a day because that is all I can work now without having a nervous breakdown is rather weird. It is hard to pinpoint one actual occurrence, but I know this woman or some man who's name was given to him by me watches everything I do. Should I call the F.B.I. and give her name? Troll. Removed.  Provide some more details, right now you’ve given more proof that your delusional than proof that you aren’t. What are some of the things that happened to you? Why mention that her husband is a Jew? ARE YOU back on lithium tho
