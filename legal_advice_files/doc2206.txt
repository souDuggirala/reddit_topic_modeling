 So i am apart of a settlement that involves an old employer not payong wages and not giving meal breaks etc, and had been waiting for the initial paperwork to verify the information for the time I worked was correct since september. I had to update my address because I moved, and when I did the lawfirm took the information incorrectly and had the wrong address so i never recieved the letters, come November I call again and update them with that info and they supposedly sent it to the correct address but i still have not recieved a physical copy in the mail so I called again today and after everything they said they could just email to me. so after getting them to email it (today) I read that the company that is being sued said I only worked 4 weeks out of the period of decemeber 2014 - august 2018 when I in fact worked at least a year. I have w2's that show this, but after calling the lawfirm back they told me october was the cutoff for disputing information on the case, now instead of the larger check I was suppose to recieve, they are only giving me 4 weeks worth ($184) What do I do? It is not my fault they didnt get my address correct, or email it sooner they had my email the whole time. Any and all help is appreciated thank you
