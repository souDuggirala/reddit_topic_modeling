 My father slipped and fell on a boat ramp at his place of employment, which also happens to be his employer's home property. He broke his neck and is now getting treatment for it, he will be going into surgery later this week as the break is unstable. As far as I am aware, he was doing nothing out of the ordinary for someone in his field of work and has been doing this kind of work for decades, so it would be reasonable to assume he knows what he's doing and wouldn't intentionally or unintentionally put himself at undue risk . This occurred in Florida, which is also our place of residence and my father is also living on the property that this occurred at. I was wondering if he has a case in the event that his job security is at risk due to this happening. I am simply asking for the possibility of a case and will tell him to get a lawyer if things start looking worse. Any information and opinions are appreciated and welcome, and I will answer questions to the best of my ability, thank you! That should be his first step. If he is covered by workman's comp then all of his medical expenses will be covered but he may give up rights to sue for other damages. I do not know at this time, I am fairly certain he has contacted his employer but unsure about the workman's compensation. Did your father contact his employer and request workman's compensation?
