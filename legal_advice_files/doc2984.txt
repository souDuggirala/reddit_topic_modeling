 I am considering suing my former employer, a very well known Christian church organization. To put it succinctly, I am alleging employees and agents of this organization did significant and lasting damage to myself and my family, resulting in the destruction of my marriage as well as significant financial loss. Admittedly, proving these things would be somewhat difficult, but I have alot of circumstancial evidence and deposing my ex-wife would likely reveal it all, assuming she would be truthful. As I stated this is a large, well known organization and they wouldnâ€™t want this kind of public attention and most likely would settle out of court. I have no money to pay an attorney, whoever took the case, if they think there is one, would need to take it on contingency. I am looking for advice on next steps. I am in Virginia. Thanks.
