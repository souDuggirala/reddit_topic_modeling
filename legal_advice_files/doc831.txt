 Apartment in Chico got bought recently by a new property management company after Paradise fires. They recently sent an email saying we have 60 days to vacate for renovations, since Chico’s been doing a lot of remodeling to make the shitter parts of town nicer. There’s a whole bunch of other stuff about the new company not filing to the court on the purchase of the complex but I just heard that around. The year lease has nothing that talks about owner ending the agreement early. No one’s being compensated and a lot of the tenants are just section 8 and students. And this is 200+ tenants being kicked out while Chico’s having a housing crisis. Is this legal? And what rights do we have which compensates for breaking the lease? Also would appreciate any advice to fight this. Thanks. Sounds like you all need to get together and speak with an attorney. Generally speaking, leases transfer ownership when a place sells. Your leases should remain valid, unless there is some information that is missing. Are the units habitable? Regardless, they should be compensating you in some way. Yeah, go talk to a lawyer.
