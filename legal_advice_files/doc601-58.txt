I was pulled over last week for going 50mph in a 35mph zone as it was just ending before the 45mph zone. The officer (county sheriff) made it clear that that is why he stopped me and that's what the ticket was for. This is my first time being ticketed as last time i was let off with a verbal warning. he questioned me about having Minnesota plates but a Wisconsin ID and i said i was living here for school but bought my car in Minnesota where my parents live and they co signed so we kept it under their insurance and thus Minnesota plates. He seemed to accept why that was the case and asked where i was going to school. went back to his car and wrote up a citation for 15 over however upon looking at the ticket he might have written out the wrong penal code. the one he had on the ticket was 69.01 which is a Wisconsin vehicle registration issue. and 69.03 is failure to obey speed limits and has a subsection for the specific zone i was caught in. If it was for speeding like the officer said wouldn't he have noted that its a 69.03 for speeding not a registration issue 69.01? and if it was about my registration why would he have said i got a ticket for speeding and wouldn't a registration ticket first offence be a "fix it ticket" If he messed up the wrong code does that give me ground to stand on or can i fight it as a registration issue which i dont have and it will get thrown out in court?

&amp;#x200B; If you are being formally charged with the registration issue, then yes you have a defense against that charge. However, given that the ticket clearly indicates that it's for speeding, it's a typo and you will eventually have to face the speeding ticket Ill check when i get home from work. Im not opposing speeding i know i was however if they are charging me with registration issues which i have none that i should be let off on.  A typo on a ticket does not give you grounds to oppose the ticket. You should contact the Court to verify the charges. More than likely there's an option to plead online, if you log on and enter the ticket information what does it say the charges are?
