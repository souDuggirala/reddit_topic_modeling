 Hi. So, my microbiology teacher says that we have to show her proof of purchase for our lab workbook to make sure we are not breaking copyright law, and she doesn't allow used textbooks under the same excuse. I bought a used workbook in good condition with no writing or marks on it for $117 and now she says that she won't accept my lab reports if I don't show her proof of purchase for a brand new workbook or a digital subscription. Is copyright law supposed to be used this way? or is this nonsense because I can't get back even half of what I payed for the workbook. I didn't think that using used books was against copyright law, but what do I know I'm studying biology. Any answers are appreciated and thanks in advance! I'm not sure about your specific circumstances, but if copyright laws are a problem for used books, they'd never be (re)used anywhere in college. So this sounds suspect to me. I'd take it to the department head, or maybe the campus legal office. I can see the argument for not allowing used workbooks related to plagiarism or cheating off work already done, but not copyright.  She cannot bar you from buying used books as a violation of copyright. The Supreme Court has held that purchasing an item gives you the right to resell it (or even rent it - this is how video stores made money). I would take the issue up with a department head as it is very likely she is simply attempting to make money from new book sales.  Sounds like bs to me. I'd contact the department head.
