 I bought from a private seller, we knew the car had problems starting but was told that it had been fixed. We bought the car and within the first week the starter went out, air bag light comes on and off, check engine, failed inspection, doors sometimes swing open unless slammed.oh and a blown strut. We were not informed about any of this and on the bill of sale it says “no mechanical issues are known” does this qualify for Lemmon law. I can also prove he knew about the strut and starter because I talked to the mechanic he had got work done at.  About 1 week, 105,000, I called the mechanic shop he got the ground wire done at, they said they had informed him that his starter needed to be replaced and that his strut was bad.   How long ago did you buy the car? How many miles are on the car? What evidence do you have that the previous owner knew about these issues?
