 Hi everyone, Thanks in advance for the help. My friend is in need of help. Her neighbor has a big tree that is tilting towards her home and is worried about it falling. She has tried contacting the neighbor but is not responding. What should she do? Thanks! Call the city with the concern about the tree. Also have her call her homeowner's insurance to give them the heads up that she has called the city about this problem tree. Then go out and take pictures of it. What should happen if any damage to her house occurs is her homeowner's insurance will go after the neighbor for payment. My sister and brother-in-law had a neighbor who had a dead tree on his property, he knew the tree was dead but didn't want to take it down (actually didn't want to pay but if sister paid most of removal that was fine), and if it fell it could cause damage to my sister's house. Neighbor was of the belief that if damage occurred my sister's homeowner's insurance would take care of it. He was surprised to find out from his own company that my sister's insurance would come after him because she had proof that he knew the tree was dead and his company told him they would cancel his policy due to negligence if she filed a claim with them. He had the tree cut down and paid 100% of the removal costs. Is the tree crossing over the property boundary from offending neighbor's yard into/onto your friend's property? Generally speaking you are within your lawful rights to trim/prune anything that is crossing the line and on your property. That said I would place a quick call to the City and ask them the question before you/her pull the trigger on this. In my experience city arborists are super helpful and this is a pretty standard question. Phone: (650) 522-7420
