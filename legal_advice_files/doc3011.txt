  I am in the middle of an ugly divorce, and currently am not able to speak to my separated spouse per an order. I have a written agreement with my wife dating back to October 7th where we are to leave the other's paychecks alone (separated finances) even though we both have access to the joint account (due to mutual bills). We followed this structure of only sharing money in this account to square up what we owed one another. After the restraining order was placed, she withdrew half of one check of mine (December 13th, $500), knowing I could not respond, and that I would not have enough money to take action. I changed my direct deposit information, but it takes a pay period to take hold, so another check processed yesterday. Before it even posted, there were two transfers that followed from my wife in the total amount of $750. I now do not have enough money to finalize the apartments I was looking at and I will remain homeless for another two weeks at least. I was told that calling the police could get ME into trouble since it is not a criminal matter, but a civil one, and I don't want to take the wrong course of action. Even without a vehicle, I could find a way to make it to the court house to file if that is what I need to do, but I could use some direction please.
