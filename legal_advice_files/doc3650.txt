 Was at a house party/kickback in Shawnee,KS. Cops came because of a noise complaint and I admitted to drinking a beer, which is really all I drank. But because I am a minor (19) the limit is 0.00 and I of course blew over that. I was 100% cooperative with giving my info, etc. Now I am waiting for the citation in the mail. What should I do once it arrives? This is the first time ive ever been in trouble with the law and I would like to know what happens from here. Thank you.  good luck with Johnson Co where they make you go on color code and drop piss for the slightest amount of possession (pot) so you could be subjected to similar excessive penalties. Lawrence, KS/Douglas Co resident here. the penalties for these infractions are drastically less extreme literally the next county over. edit: look into getting diversion. Depends on state but most states can file the charges under “first time offender” or something similar. Generally, you pay the fine, get assigned community service to complete, and get put on probation. If you finish the community service and probation without any more charges, they generally automatically expunge the charge and or give you the option to pursue that.  Idk, some states may put the case off to the side for a year and if you dont fuck up in that year it just goes away. Can a MIP be expunged from my record?
