 As stated - back in May I rear ended the car in front of me. Caused damage to the cars rear bumper and repair ended up being about $2,500 dollars. I was at fault and my car insurance had lapsed at the time - completely due to my negligence of not updating the card on file. Anyways, I just received a letter from a Law group requesting my insurance information. Shortly after the accident, I had informed the other party that I did not car insurance. They asked that I pay out of pocket - I said that is fine as long as they sign a waiver of liability upon me paying for any damages. They then declined and went the insurance route. I received a subrogation letter requesting $6,000 from a third party (I'm assuming contracted by his insurance company). I did not hear from them. Looks like they are suing me now. I am a recent grad - only assets in my name are about $5k in savings and an old car probably worth $1k. I also received a subrogation letter requesting $6,000 from a third party (I'm assuming contracted by his insurance company) about 2 months ago. This is a separate entity from the Law Firm that is now reaching out to me. A payment plan with who? - I dont even know what/how much the law firm is suing me for. I do know how much the subrogation firm is asking though do I set up a plan with them? If I'm on the hook for $6k plus some insane amount because the other party is suing me for injury then there is no way I can pay that - even with a payment plan. Set up a payment plan.
