 I got a notice from the DMV that my registration had been revoked because my car insurance lapsed. Also, the renewal date on my registration has passed. To further complicate things, myself and the vehicle are currently located out of state. I need to get the vehicle re-registered in MA and pay whatever fees they're going to require. But I can't find any information about this situation so I'm hoping someone here can help me out. Also hoping that I don't have to be in-person to handle all of this.  Happy to be able to help. Thank you so much. Your flair "quality contributor" is accurate.  You're going to have to renew your MA insurance. When you have done that you will be able to reinstate your registration (the fee is $100). You use the RMV-3 form for reinstatement.
