 My step-brothers mom was going to Spain and asked to borrow 1000 dollars from my brother. When we could not she asked him if I would do it. I agreed and gave my brother the money to give his mother. She went on the Spain trip and when she got me back was very slow to get back to us as we live in another state for work. I have since moved home and I messaged her on Facebook asking how she was doing/if she could pay me back. She stated that she did not know 100% who the money came from and never the less did not have it and would not for a long while. I showed her text messages between my brother and I proving it was from me and she is still very on the fence on if she will pay me back and if she does not know when. What are my legal rights to get this money back? Do I have a legal standing because it was through a 3rd party? I have enough evidence proving she knows it was most likely my money. Does this give me any transaction? I will sue if I need to.  OP she has no intention of paying you back. She asked her son to ask you and the money came through, she now says she’s not 100% sure the money came from you in the first place. Her son would verify that. Also, “I’m not sure you produced the money and I won’t have it for a long time anyway”, if she thought you didn’t provide the money, why would she bother about informing you she doesn’t have it. She is telling you to get bent without facing the moral implications of doing so, she is a coward. Your brother is your best option, if you have a good relationship put pressure on him to put pressure on the mom. If you agree to some pay back scheme you will only recover parts of your money. This has been an expensive lesson to you, don’t lend money to family. You will have a tough time getting that back. You could try to hire a collections company to send her a nastygram that looks semi-official. But that would likely cause more harm than good. I would be pressuring the third-party.
