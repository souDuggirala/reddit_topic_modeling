 Pretty much what the title says. I dunno how to get this thing fixed. It's been more than a year since I've been trying to get the W-2 for 2017. I keep getting the run around from the owner (he says judge says its wife's responsibility to do the taxes, she says it's his. They're going through a divorce, fucking me in the process). They paid me with hand written checks, which I cashed at work, but no stubs. I'm trying to not go light a house on fire and still get what I believed I worked for... Am i screwed out of everything involving the supposed deductions for FICA and all that garbage? What's the overall deal? ELI5 Just my luck. Poor folks can't ever catch a break. Just my luck. Poor folks never get a break.  You can go see a tax attorney, but it may cost more than it is worth. Iâ€™d check on the personal finance sub. See if they have any thoughts.  Been estimating by hourly rate, nothing happened for me ever. They got audited a few years ago, but I haven't heard anything. Which is why I made this post. I'm on mobile, so this formatting is just as anger inducing as the issue.  Then all you can do is try to figure out the numbers yourself and report based on what you know.  I've been trying this since 2009, doesn't really work when I call because I have no pay stubs. Contact the IRS.
