(Throwaway account)

My old room mate lived with me for a year. He had previous felonies that happened 5+ years ago. During the year he lived with me, he got in legal trouble for having sex with minors and was arrested and charged with ‘Rape of an authority figure’ (he was hooking up with employees from his job). This all happened the last month he lived with me, so I currently have no idea where that entire legal battle went or if it’s currently still going on. I am aware though, that he is not currently in jail. Once it was time to renew the lease, I decided to go into the second year myself and he moved, while I stayed at the apartment. 

He moved at the start of this year. Since then, it has come to my attention that he is still using this address. I receive mail for him constantly from lawyers, the state, and as of recently the new job he started a few weeks ago sent him a benefit package information meaning that he even listed this address at his very new job. For months, I have been writing ‘return to sender: Does not live here’. A lot of mail has stopped coming here because of that, but I still get some throughout the month addressed to him. 

I’ve also have had detectives show up at my front door banging on it months after he moved. Meaning that he hasn’t updated his address on that side of things either. 

How can I make all of this stop? I’m absolutely tired of it. I don’t necessarily want to go to the extreme of taking it to court or getting him in more legal trouble. I just want it to stop. Advice?
