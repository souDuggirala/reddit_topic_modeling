 TL;DR I hit someone, they gave me a bill that didn't describe any of the damage in our accident. How do I approach this without looking guilty for the entirety of the damage? Basically I hit someone recently, just a minor fender bender, tiny dent in her car and no damage to my car. We just exchanged phone numbers and I told her I'd just give her cash because I figured just a dent would be no big deal. She comes to me a little bit after with the bill, which was in the thousands and made me a little suspicious. Once I looked closer, I realized a lot of the things repaired had nothing to do with our accident (i.e. parts of the car that my car could not physically reach due to its size). On top of this, there was no mention in the bill about fixing the initial dent that was caused by my car. So now I'm in this situation where I want to give this girl money for what I caused, but it's almost like she's giving me a bill for a completely different accident. Is there any way I can approach my insurance with this information without being blamed for all of the damage? (Just some side info, neither of us have any pictures or each others insurance information, so I know I could probably just walk, but I still want to give money for the dent.) Just give her your insurance information. They will take sworn statements from both of you and decide what action to take.  Thatâ€™s why you always Take pictures of the vehicles involved and of ids. Unless if she intentionally damaged her car afterwards just request an explanation on how these repairs apply to the damage you caused Alternatively, this is what your insurance is for. They can fight this on your behalf
