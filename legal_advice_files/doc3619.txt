 My neighbor had been leaving her 8 year old son home alone for a few hours in the evening and most of the day on Saturday. He is at my house a lot of this time but if I have something to do or if he just doesn’t want to come over then he’s alone. I’m also getting tired of him being at my house so much. He’s a rude child and doesn’t respect me or my son. So I guess I’m asking what I should do here. My husband wants to call cps but will they do anything? Is this illegal? I was thinking of mentioning it to the school social worker but I’m conflicted.  Talk to the mom first about her getting proper childcare for her son, or maybe putting him in afterschool care. If she refuses and the problem persists, call CPS.  Please don’t call cps u less you know for sure he’s living in an abusive or neglectful situation. I know this isn’t probably what you want to hear. Maybe have a discussion with the mom first? I don’t know. Cps can ruin people’s lives. Maybe she can’t afford proper babysitting etc. Call CPS if you're concerned. I'm not finding any laws regarding age of children left alone, so they're likely to handle it based on whether the kid seems able to deal with emergencies if they come up. You can certainly refuse to let the child into your house, though you may want to talk to the neighbor in person about "not having time to watch Bobby so much anymore" beforehand.  You can call CPS. It may or may not be a problem. Depends on the child and the risk of the child being harmed.
