So, as the title says, my dad loaned money to a coworker and now he’s not paying my dad back. 

We live in Illinois, my dad loaned him (he hasn’t said how much) we believe over $1,000 and neither one signed anything but it was a verbal agreement that the coworker would pay him back every other Friday. 

This Friday was a payment day and my dad tried to call the man and got no answer, even had another coworker call him and they got no answer. 

I suppose my question is where do we go from here? Are verbal contracts binding in Illinois? And do we take him to small claims court? Verbal contracts are generally binding, but enforcing them can be difficult as it is extremely hard to prove the terms.  In a case like this it may even be difficult to prove the loan was ever given to begin with. They deal in all cash but I’m positive that my dad has the text messages to prove it.  Is there any trail at all? Text messages, Check written to the coworker? Checks from the coworker making any payments? Etc...
