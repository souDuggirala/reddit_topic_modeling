 I live in fairfax county in northern virginia and i was pulled over for an expired registration but they smelled weed and i decided to immediately fess up and told him I had over an 8th since I figured they would end up searching my car anyway. Ultimately he let me off on the car registration but gave me a ticket for possession of marijuana. This will be my 2nd offense...my first one was when I was 18 in January of 2014. What are the chances I will have to serve jail time?  As your second conviction, this will be a Class 1 misdemeanor which carries potential penalties of up to a year confinement and/or up to $2k fine. Not saying this will happen, but this is the maximum you're facing. You need a lawyer.  If he gave you a ticket, youâ€™re not going to jail.
