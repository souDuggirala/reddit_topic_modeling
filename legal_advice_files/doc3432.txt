 Please just re direct to to an already existing thread if this is a redundant post. This is a follow up to a previous post of mine, if anyone wants context to the situation. I'll link below. Do i just google ''attorneys in my area''? Is there a source for different attorneys and the types of cases they specialize in? should i go through my city's courthouse to hire a public defender? I just need one to help make sure I don't get sued for anything more than i deserve, as I need to consider the possibility of my situation being taken to court.

The other party’s attorney filed a claim though my renters insurance, and yesterday the adjuster for the case called me and got my side of the story.

Google will give you all of them
