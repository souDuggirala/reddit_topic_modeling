 lets say someone over the age of consent in the united states sexts someone of the age of 15 in australia and logs are reported to law enforcement. what is the likelyhood any legal action will be taken against either individual? Police investigate crimes for a reason. It's not possible to provide you with a clear answer to your question.  It helps answer the question but it makes the person in the US guilty of a bunch of really serious federal crimes. By "sexting" do you mean "child pornography?" Because if so, the odds of legal action against the person in the US go up a whole lot. what details would be required for a better answer here? lets say lewd photos are involved between both parties. does this help? Impossible to tell. Anywhere from 0% to 100% chance. We're not clairvoyants.
