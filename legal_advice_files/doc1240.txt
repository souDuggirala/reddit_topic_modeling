 Calgary, Alberta I live in a condo and one neighbour is complaining to the board of the cannabis smell coming from my unit. I am a medical licensed smoker and am on disability. I have received a complaint letter through the management company of the complaint. I responded that I am under a physicians prescription for medical cannabis. I just received a request to provide a diary of the times I smoke, how I smoked and what part of the unit I smoked in. Wtf Do I really need to do this???? I would assume they are trying to pinpoint where the fumes are escaping your unit, so it can be remedied.
