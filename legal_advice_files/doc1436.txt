 Hi, This may look weird, but I'm in a Discord server that was made for gaming, but eventually was dominated by professionals from all fields. We used to have a Law student that explained legal concepts and case studies. He had to leave due to studies and he may not return. We greatly enjoyed his input and perspective as he analysed cases and explained them to us so we could learn as well. I'm hoping that this would interest some of you as we miss having legal and logical debates in our channel. Bonus if you're a gamer. I'll leave the link down below if something like this catches your eyes  /r/legaladviceofftopic
