 I live in a sorority house in WI and there’s been a homeless man living in a camper parked right out side my bedroom since before thanksgiving. He was digging through our trash yesterday. My friend’s boyfriend is a police officer and told the man he has 3 days to move or he’d be towed (told him Saturday). He still hasn’t moved. What should we do? If he is living in a camper, he is not homeless. If your trash has been put out for collection, it is public. If he is parked on a street where there are no parking restrictions, and his camper is street legal, there is nothing you can do. Except maybe take a tray of cookies to your new neighbour.  He's trespassing.  Unless it's a private street or posted "no parking", or unless the vehicle is somehow out of compliance with state or municipal ordinances (such as being inoperative or unregistered), it can almost certainly be parked on a public street indefinitely. The fastest and simplest solution is to install blackout shades in your bedroom window. If you catch him peering in your windows, loitering, yelling at you, exposing himself, urinating in public, making a nuisance of himself, or littering, that's another story. That gives the police a little more ability to move him along. call the cops Is your sorority house on campus or off campus? If on campus you can talk to the university about him trespassing. If off campus is he on the property of the house? If so get ahold of your national chapter for help. If it’s city property ask your boyfriend what to do next. He will know who to talk to in the city.
