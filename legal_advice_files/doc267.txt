 To cut a long story short my relationship (m28) with my fiance (f25) is starting to fall apart. Although we are trying to work through our issues things aren't improving. We do not currently live together (part of the problem) but have a joint savings account that we both contribute to. The thing is I have contributed about 75% of the money as I work full time and she doesn't. How is this money viewed by the law? Is it 50/50 even though we don't live together and aren't in a defecto relationship. Or is it based off contribution. This is in Vic Australia. Any advice appreciated.  If your name is on the account you can do whatever you want with any funds contained - the “wronged” party can get back some money (say if you went a drained the whole account) but legal action would be required.  Thanks. Just wasn't sure if it is one of those things that will bite me in the arse if I just withdrew it all.  Once you’ve got a joint account you’re both 100% entitled to the account. You’re essentially equal holders as it’s in both your names. Strongly suggest you get your portion out ASAP. Good luck!
