 My manager put in my schedule that I'm supposed to work Thursday between 12am-10am (night shift) for thanks giving morning. So when I leave my house wendsday night to make sure I'm on time because it takes me about 45 minutes to get to work, he tells me that when put Thursday 12am, he meant that as I'm supposed to arrive at work at Friday midnight to Friday 10am and that I literally came in 24 hours early but I followed my schedule to the T. I already know he's kinda dumb and cant tell time apparently but is there anyway I can get compensated for my time spent taking public transportation and paying to get on the trains (or all 10 hours because those hours were time and a half), and time explaining how he was wrong as to how he set up the schedule and how he told me he was right so I just went home. Keep in mind I live and work in New York city Incredibly unlikely. Some places especially in the casino business put out schedules this way. Sorry So you showed up at work, did no work, and then came home? as required or requested, even if no work is performed. While there is no federal requirement on this matter, at least eight states (and the District of Columbia) have issued provisions related to compensating employees for showing up to work. In NY: Referred to as “call-in pay,” employee shall be paid at least four hours, or the number of hours in the regularly scheduled shift, whichever is less, at the basic minimum hourly wage. You have an argument here for four hours of pay, you can contact the New York State Department of Labor and get their opinion on the matter. post the picture so we can see what you did and then we can comment from there
