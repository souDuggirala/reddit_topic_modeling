 Quick question - I am a patient in chronic pain. I'm starting a video blog to talk about my journey and help others on theirs. I also happen to be an unlicensed physician. I've done medical school, but haven't done a residency (and I don't intend to - I work in industry). I need to make sure my videos are disclaimered properly to both convey I am not offering medical advice - this is meant as a companion to going to your doctors. Additionally, I need to convey this is solely my opinion and is unaffiliated with my employers. Lastly, I need to protect my IP. I don't even know the type of lawyer to start with. I asked a few lawyers and they weren't sure, haha. I'm in the Boston area if anyone knows of a firm that will help me create this disclaimer and provide me with advice about how to protect my online IP.
