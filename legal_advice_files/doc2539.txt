 Hi! We are in MÃ©xico. My best friends mum was just told she is in the terminal stage of her cancer battle (there are methastasis and it's not responding to treatment). She doesn't want to leave stuff undealt with. That happened to my family when my own mum passed from breast cancer and she doesn't want to put that on her family. She is mostly concerned with her debt, she has a couple of credit cards and store cards, they are up to date with payments but she would like to know what can she do to help her family in that regard. She has already made a sort of will, with her wishes regarding her cremation and disposal of her ashes. Anything else she should be looking into? Thank you in advance.
