 We live in Florida. We purchased a home last year and after last year's season decided we wanted to install hurricane shutters. I asked around on a facebook page for the neighborhood and found a neighbor who raved about this one company. We went ahead and met with the owner, he came out and took measurements and gave us a quote. We decided to go with him. He brought over a copy of the invoice and my husband and him signed it. We provided a check for half the cost in July. There was no contract provided or timeline. He's given us updates about the process and pushbacks. However, recently he said we were good to install and I asked if he'd pulled the permit. He had not. Turns out he is a licensed contractor but not a general contractor so cannot pull the permit. He never got a permit for neighbors house. He has a friend who he says can as a general and he can legally work under him, ok. Except he told me a permit application was submitted the week before Thanksgiving. I followed up myself and nothing has been submitted. I texted him asking about this but got no response. At this point we just want permitted work or our money back. We are kind of at a loss as to how to move forward? Are there any suggestions on how to get our deposit back if he cannot provide permitted work (which is required in our country)? Or do we have to call this a loss? It's quite a bit of money weve already paid. We tried but needed the contractors info along with product info and we don't have that. We could report him but since he hasnt installed the job I'm not sure it would matter? And I guess we could definitely go to small claims court but I'm worried that would cost more money? You could call the county inspectors office to report him, or take him to smalls claims court to try to get your money back.. also.. it may be possible for you yourself to obtain the permit (since it's your property)
