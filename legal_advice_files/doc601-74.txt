So for example if I had a case where pills are stored in, could I be charged for something even if there are no pills inside? If you do not have a prescription for a drug, how would you get a prescription bottle for that drug?  Is it someone else's prescription?

Why would you want to do this?

Even if it's not illegal, in and of itself, the circumstances under which you have it could make it illegal, or could be used  as evidence against you for another crime.

For example, if you present the bottle to law enforcement to explain drugs they find on you, that could be construed as a crime.

Or, if you are pulled over for erratic driving, the empty pill bottle could be used as evidence that you are impaired, at least to establish probable cause to make an arrest.

&amp;#x200B; There's a lot of detail missing from the question. Is there a charge you're concerned about?
What country,state, etc. Is this a hypothetical question?  It would be a stretch for anyone to prosecute you over an empty container without some other evidence that you had drugs that weren't yours. If you live in a jurisdiction where med theft is common, you might be more at risk for such a thing.

**Pre**scription containers should be properly disposed of by the rightful owner once empty. Location ? 
In the USA it must be in the original bottle clearly labeled if you do not want to carry all of your meds with you ask your pharmacy for a second labeled bottle and state the purpose  for work ect .
The labeled bottle in an emergency indicates what meds you may have taken and that they are legal for you to have under any circumstances not potentially street drugs . 

In the empty meds case if you're believed to be impaired and or committed a crime they have the right to take the case to test for drugs. Edit/ final sentence
