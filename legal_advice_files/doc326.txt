 My mother-in-law was disappoint with the cutting of her channels, promised prices that kept fluctuating and so fourth. So we ended her service. There was an over collection of money since she had it directly paid from her checking account. The refund comes in a prepay MC. This card charges a $3.00 maintenance fee per month. I feel this is not right. It just should like a scam to retain money on their over charge. What do you think?\  This. Easy enough and done.  Use the prepaid CC to but something like a Walmart gift card which doesn't have the monthly charge. Or an Amazon gift card.  It's not a scam. Virtually all prepaid cards charge a monthly fee that is roughly $3 to $7. That's how the prepaid card banks make money. If you don't want to pay the fee, spend it withdraw the funds. This isn't a legal issue.  It's the prepaid MasterCard company that is getting those fees, not DirecTV. Maybe she could quickly use up the MasterCard balance to pay for groceries, gasoline, utility bills, or other expenses that would eventually end up coming out of her checking account anyway. Had her contract (assuming there was one) ended or did she break the contract? Can she use the card at an ATM and take the $300 out all at once? Then just turn around and put it into her bank account.
