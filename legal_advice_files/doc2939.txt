 The factory I work at is a private company. New workers make $7.25an hour. They are given over time, but the overtime work consists of leaving the factory grounds to go to the bosses homes to wash their cars, clean their pools, land scape etc. and most of the time it doesn’t even cross over into over time because we are let off early on fridays, seemingly to keeo ua from actually ever hitting 40 hours. Middle of winter, washing cars. Middle of summer mowing 5 acres of grass and on your hand and knees pulling weeds out of a flower bed. None of the employees are willing to do this work for $7.25. If they don’t take this “over time”, they are let go because they aren’t willing to do the work mentioned here. Even though that type of work is never mentioned at the time of hiring. Now, the owner tells all of the employees that we can’t even leave the grounds at lunch time because of an insurance issue he never fully explains to us. Which makes no sense, because he has no problem sending us to his house on company time. So my question is, is sending us to their homes to take care of their yards and cars against OSHA regulations? And is telling us we will have to be let go if we aren’t willing to do this type of work considered extortion? Thank you.  Not extortion, not illegal. Not against OSHA as long as proper safety equipment is provided. Washing cars, mowing yards, pulling weeds are not particularly hazardous work. Given the choice between doing these sort of tasks and keeping your job is not illegal either, it may be against a union agreement. Keeping employees on the grounds at lunch could be a labor law violation if employees are not getting paid for this time. I'd suggest finding a different job.
