 Last week, I unknowingly parked under a university security camera before going to a bar. The next day, I found my car was smashed by a hit and run (with no note). I need to discover their identity for my insurance to cover me, so I could ask the police to acquire the university's security footage (uni will not reveal the footage to me or review it themselves). I suspect the event happened in the early morning hours of Saturday. nsbp; The problem is that the cameras may have footage of earlier in the night of Friday of myself and friends, in what may appear to be some nasal insufflation of a substance in the car. I can request that they just acquire Saturday morning footage between midnight and 5 am as the window of the hit and run, but regardless, is there any possible repercussion from this? I do not possess any illegal drugs and there is no definitive evidence of what may have been snorted in the car.  Most places if they have cctv, will never give access to members of the general public. If you really want to, contact the police and they will reach out to the Uni. You said there’s no definitive evidence, them seeing that clip ( if they even do) might spark an investigation, but they don’t know what you were sniffing, for all they know you and your friends were weirdos who where snorting caffine pills to get a rush  If it helps your decision-making process, there's a strong possibility that the camera will give you the make/model of the car but not enough to definitively identify it or the driver. It's also entirely possible that the cameras aren't working in the first place. But in any case, the penalties for illegal drug use are nothing to sniff at and I would consider letting this lie.
