 Hi, I went to visit my friend and while leaving the garage, the gate closed on my car. This is a very new high rise in Downtown LA. The management apologized agreed to pay for the damage to my car. They asked me to send them the estimate and that they would handle. I got an estimate (several thousands of dollars) and now they aren't answering (been over a month). What can I do? Contact them again, and keep contacting them.
