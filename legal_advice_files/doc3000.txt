 I moved into a new apartment about 4 months ago, and we were told we had to pay for garage, trash, water, and personal electricity as part of our utilities. However, I recently received an email saying that we were going to have to pay an additional 20$ a month for “common area electricity” which is paid by everyone who lives here. Know this pushes my monthly rent to basically 1,000$, and it’s not even that great of an apartment. My question is, is it even legal for them to spring this random utility of us 4 months after move in, with no notice of it coming before/during move in time? I think it’s wrong they can add extra payments when I didn’t think I’d have to pay for this when I had chose this as my apparent. What are some options I have in this situation.  Thank you for your help. This has answered my question. This is what I thought the answer would be, but I just wanted to make sure there was nothing they could do legally to change it without me knowing.  Check for any language that suggests they can add this sort of cost on as well though. My apartment complex has basically free reign to charge us up because of the language in our lease. Basically signed my life away.  Exactly if it's not in your lease then you ask them where in your lease it is and when they are forced to acknowledge that no it's not in your lease, then no you don't have to pay it. Tell them it was not included in your lease so you will not be paying it. Don't pay it and send them a response asking where in your lease this fee is shown as your responsibility.  Never said anything about common area electricity  It all boils down to what you agreed to pay in your lease. What does your lease say? If it’s not in my lease, I don’t think it is, what can I say then? Read your lease. If it is in your lease then you are responsible for it. If it is not in your lease, then send them a response asking where in your lease this fee is shown as your responsibility.
