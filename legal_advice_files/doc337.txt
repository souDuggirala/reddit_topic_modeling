 Hello everyone. I have a dilemma, and I want to seek out advice for this situation. I purchased a shirt from a vintage store yesterday by debit card, and I came back home and decided I want to try to return it. I called the store, and they told me”sorry but we have a no refund all sales final policy”. I contacted my bank, and was told I can make a dispute attempt. I understand that I should’ve been aware of the no refund policy, but I am trying in good faith to return the product back to the merchant and in turn get my money back. How realistic is it to get my money back in this situation after making a dispute chargeback claim?  No return policy means just that. What you are proposing is scam a business. Resell the shirt online.  Your bank will likely refund the money temporarily while they “investigate” the claim, which involves them talking with the merchant. The merchant will likely tell the bank that they have a no refund policy and they will not accept the t-shirt back. Many merchants can’t accept back goods, even if unused. Disputes with your bank should only be for situations where you did not receive the merchandise, or someone made unauthorized charges on your card. They’re not for deciding you didn’t want something and then finding out there was a no refund policy. So, while you will get the temporary refund during the investigation, once the bank finds out you did receive the shirt and the seller has an all sales final policy, they’ll take the money back out of your account when they close the investigation and you’ll be out what you spent on it.
