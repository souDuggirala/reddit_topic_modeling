 I recently purchased a car from a small dealership and paid cash. Around the same time, the dealership decided to go cash-only and end their relationship with the private company that managed their financing. The guy who sold me the car said that the financing company held all of the car titles (he also called them bills of sale). Now that the dealership is closing their account with the financing company, the financing company is saying that it will take 60 days for them to return the titles to the dealership. In WA, a dealer is required to submit the sale paperwork within 45 days of delivery (I drove the car home the day of purchase). Is the financing company allowed to hold the titles for that long? Are they not also under the 45 day obligation? Is there anything I can do to expedite this process? Would filing a dealer complaint [here]() help, even though it sounds like the problem is with the financing company? Also uploading a screenshot of a portion of the conversation [here]() for reference. Also, all signs point to the dealer being legit, just not necessarily super competent (it's a body shop that flips rebuilt titles on the side), so please keep comments regarding dealer fraud to a minimum. They are a registered dealer, I checked.
