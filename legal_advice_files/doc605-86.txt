My grandfather gave me his car but it’s still registered under his name. I got a ticket in the mail for passing a “stopped school bus”.  The ticket was given under my grandfathers name but the ticket said if the ticket issued wasn’t the person driving go to the police station and they will issue a new ticket to the driver who actually passed the school bus. This is where gets confusing, I still had to plea not guilty on my grandfathers ticket and the new ticket given too me. Just got two letters in the mail, one letter for my grandfather saying they turned the violation from a moving school bus to a “passed a stop sign” and he has to pay $150. My letter says I need to provide a statement why I am not guilty.

I am so confused. Shouldn’t they have dropped my grandpas ticket and just given me the passing stop sign ticket. Does my grandfather pay the stop sign ticket and do I still provided a statement. Please help!
