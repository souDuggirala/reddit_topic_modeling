 My service with SafeLink's Lifeline Wireless service for those on government services (Medicaid Food Stamps) started in January of 2015. Each year I had to renew it at points while I was unemployed (and there were a lot). My end of service date should have been 01/31/2019 but it was terminated on 12/31/2018. Okay, that's a bummer but okay. I can get onto TracFone and use their cheap pay as you go services. I tried to enter my phone's IMEI into the TracFone My Account app to get the ball rolling but the app says my SIM card was deactivated. Wait, what? I can understand terminating my account since I didn't renew it, but my SIM card?? Is there anything I can do to get this rectified?
