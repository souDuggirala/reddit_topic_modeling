 Just to elaborate, I was in Pennsylvania for my grandmas funeral. He’s an alcoholic and got hammered the night before, running around having me chase after I’m while I’m also drunk. Because of his antics, I got a drunk in public charge as well. I had no idea this went down on my criminal record. I’m a mental health grad student about to graduate and move into an agency that now won’t hire me because of my “criminal history”. Is there a way, and what can I do, to get this expunged? The only honest answer is a maybe, unfortunately.  Honestly, this goes beyond internet advice territory. Many questions here are pretty standard. Crazy neighbor threatening to sue over something stupid? Ignore unless actually served with a lawsuit. Employer shorting hours? Department of Labor. Trees removed from your yard without your permission? That's gonna be expensive for someone. In this case, it's a criminal charge. Not the worst criminal charge in the world, but nonetheless, standard response there is to get a lawyer to help you get the best possible outcome. You're not paying a lawyer to get something expunged, you're paying for a chance at getting it expunged. If reddit advice could do it easily, you can bet a lawyer would have been even easier, and you'd already have one. I plead guilty to the charge. I’ve called three lawyers offices and none of them can tell me whether they can even get it dismissed. I don’t wanna pay someone for a maybe so that’s why I came on here Step 1: Get a lawyer Step 2: Do what your lawyer says Step 3: Hope that works
