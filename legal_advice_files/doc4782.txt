 After an accident where I was injured I began doing research to understand how my health insurance and the auto insurance from the other party would contribute to my medical bills. It was one ambulance ride, an ER bill, and a mild concussion along with some bruising. I have consulted with an attorney who said that if I was not planning on seeking any other medical treatment for the injury that they recommended handling the case without an attorney as the insurance company had already accepted fault and is taking responsibility for everything up to this point. What confuses me is that the hospital is billing mh health insurance first and then the auto insurance, BUT I am in Missouri. From what I have read so far, Missouri does not allow subrogation. So will my health insurance get paid out of my settlement? Do I include the full amount of the hospital bills in the settlement paperwork or only what my insurance didn't cover?
