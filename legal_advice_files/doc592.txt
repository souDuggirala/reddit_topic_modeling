 (WI) I got a “warning” from my landlord today - taped to my door - saying my apartment violated the no smoking rule for marijuana smoke. I’ve never smoked in the apartment or even had marijuana in it. Is there anything I can do to prepare myself for when/if the landlord wants to use this against me later? Also, do I have a right to ask who reported it? Thanks. I will. I appreciate the advice! Don't stress about it. Just talk to the lady you know and followup with an email summarizing your conversation.  All the notice said was to “remedy the default”. Am I overthinking it and I should just let it go? Honest question.  I would honestly keep it a little more casual than that to start. Have a conversation with the lady you deal with and follow it up with an email summarizing the conversation. Your best bet here isn't being super defense. It's convincing your landlord you don't actually smoke pot. It’s a big corporate property management company. There’s one lady there I deal with pretty regularly. I’m definitely planning on denying it in writing as we always correspond via email.  You have no right to who reported. How's your relationship with the landlord? I'd go meet with him in person and just explain that you're not sure if someone thought it was coming from your place mistakenly or what happened but you don't smoke weed.
