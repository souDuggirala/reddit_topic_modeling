 My landlord emailed me asking me and my roommate a question about our apartment. Well instead of creating a new email my landlord emailed me, cc'ing my roommate, on a thread were we were discussing my application for the apartment. In this email there were no documents, just words explaining my current income and my credit score, and my guarantors application status. This is such an easily avoidable mistake. There is no confidentiality clause in our lease, but I'm trying to understand is what the landlord did illegal? I'm not sure what outcome I want, but just an I'm sorry just feels meaning less.  A law being passed that says it is. Absent that, there's nothing special about him disclosing that information versus him disclosing what you ate for breakfast.  What would make it confidential? It seems crazy that type of information isn't kept a secret, maybe it's just not wanting people to know ones income?  That's not confidential information. Your landlord could take out a billboard in Times Square and display it if he wanted.  No law was broken.
