 Every reputable apartment complex will have the same clause in the lease “Semi rare”.... that’s rich  Dont get towed  This is the “warning” it did not have a resolve issue by this date or will be towed. Does that matter? [removed] It’s $250 and $35 every day. Funny thing is that I only paid $450 for the bike  Well damn. Then it’s my fault thank you for your response buddy. Have a great day  No because if your lease requires tags and your bike didn't have tags then it was correct they towed it. Yeah, unfortunately that's the way the cookie is crumbling. Hopefully the tow and storage fees are fairly low since it's just today they've had it. Yes sir. I was just wondering if there was anything I could do to not pay for the tow bill.  Do you have a legal question? It was towed because it doesn't have tags.  Yes sir. I went to the leasing office and they said it was deep in the fine print, well fuck. Someone’s getting free money so I can get my personal property back  You'll need to consult your lease. If it says that all vehicles have to have a tag or else they'll be towed, there isn't much you can do, especially if the warning complied with their outline warning system in the lease. In any case, dispute or no dispute, you'll need to get it out of the impound lot ASAP. You have a duty to mitigate damages and can't let it sit until the dispute is resolved.
