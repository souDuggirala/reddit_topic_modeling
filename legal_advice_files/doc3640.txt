 6 1/2 years ago I started work for Company A, a pest control company. I signed a 2 year, 200 mile radius non compete, although they only service a 40 mile radius area. After 2 years I left the company for another job, Company B, not pest control. Left Company B after 2 months and returned to Company A, and never resigned a non-compete. Stayed at Company A 3 more years. I left Company A again 1 year ago and now I work for Company C, also not pest control. I'm wanting to start my own side pest control business. It's only been 1 year since I left Company A the 2nd time. Do you think my non compete is still in effect? If so, do you think I could do pest control within the 200 mile radius, but outside of their service area? Thanks! “On January 1, 2016, Alabama's updated non-compete statute went into effect. ... In other words, the general rule in Alabama is that non-compete agreements that contain restrictive covenants involving a legal profession, trade, or business are not enforceable.” http://www.cloudwillis.com/2016/09/13/are-non-compete-agreements-valid-in-alabama/ I plan on talking to a lawyer tomorrow. Since they didn't have you sign a new non-compete the question is whether the old non-compete remained in place, as you ask us. It really is impossible for anyone here to answer that question. You probably should pay a lawyer to take a look at the agreement for you. In addition, even if the non-compete is not in place anymore, the company could come after you because it believes it is. In that case, you would end up having to deal with a potential suit, which you don't need.
