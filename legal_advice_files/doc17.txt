 I am traveling to NC soon from abroad (Tourist visa). I am not American. There is a worldwide protest being organized by several organizations to urge all governments to take steps and commit to the slowing down/reversal of the climate change crisis. I'm not a big activist myself, I have only attended one protest of the sort because I am concerned with the topic, and had nothing better to do that day. This time around, I think it would be very interesting to hear what people from a different culture have to say on the topic. What their worries are, what information they have access to which I might not know, and vice-versa. A cultural exchange. However, I do not want to do anything illegal, so I want to be sure it's O.K. for me to attend or not. From what I've found, it's kind of a grey area. A sort of "It's legal, but if people start making trouble you might get caught up in the bunch" situation. Is that right? It's completely legal to attend a protest. You can also donate money for a cause (such as climate change) but not for a specific candidate. Oh, I understand. Thank you! It didnt. Its just that it's possible that campaigns that are sympathetic to your cause would ask for donations or have a booth during the event. Nobody checks your ID at a protest. Not sure what part of my post made it look that way, but I don't intend to donate to any campaign. Yeah that was my guess. I definitely will be careful then. Thank you As a foreign national you are not allowed to donate to political campaigns. Marching and chanting is ok. Attending a peaceful protest is not illegal, for citizens, tourists, or anyone else. 's legal, but if people start making trouble you might get caught up in the bunch This is a distinct possibility and one of the risks that one inherently assumes when attending protests. No real way around it. Best bet is to not break the law, and remove yourself from any situation where the law might be broken.
