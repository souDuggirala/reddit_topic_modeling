 Iâ€™m starting grad school this winter and in an effort to reduce my overall debt I wanted to sell my vehicle and purchase a cheaper vehicle out right. I have had my truck for over a year and a half and decided to have it appraised at my local Carmax. During their initial appraisal they found that my vehicle was originally produced in Canada and as a result could make an offer. When I purchased my car it was never disclosed that it was a foreign car and there were no import bond or any additional paperwork accompanying the sale. Are there any legal actions I could pursue against the dealership for failing to disclose the country of origin for the vehicle?  Huh? Tons of cars are built overseas. Carmax just didn't want you car Import bond? Perhaps provide more info as it is difficult to figure out what the problem would be.  Vehicle origin is irrelevant to pretty much everything. It meets US standards, so you have no damages to sue for.
