 I live in a third floor apartment. The fourth floor neighbors had a toilet overflow and it flooded the three apartments below it. We had severe water damage to our living room, kitchen, guest bathroom and guest bedroom. Parts of our ceiling and carpets and walls were removed. We had to stay in a hotel from Monday, December 10th to Sunday, December 23rd. Our renters insurance covered the hotel costs, but when we confronted our leasing office manager about a rent reimbursement for the time we were not staying in or apartment, she said that we are not entitled to it because our apartment was technically “habitual” during the repairs. We brought up the fact that several of our smoke/carbon dioxide detectors were removed due to the ceiling being removed. Which we believe makes the apartment unsafe and uninhabitable. So my question is, do we have any legal grounds if they do not reimburse us the rent for the time we were displaced?
