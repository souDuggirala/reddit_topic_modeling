 I have a question please. My husband and I are living in morocco, I am a US citizen, he is not. We are not trying to get him a green card, we are only trying to see how we can visit my sick father in chicago. He has only recently gotten his passport and if I'm correct he needs it for 6 months before we can apply for a tourist visa. My dad is awaiting heart transplant surgery, in shaa Allah, and this needs to happen asap. Is there any way possible for him to come with me to visit or would I need to go without him?  Thank you for replying. As I understood it, he has to have his passport for 6 months specifically to apply for a US tourist visa, but I will absolutely go read this again, (ia) ..it will be as you say. Thank you again, our heads are spinning at this point lbvs  Or have you perhaps mis-understood the requirement, sometimes stated as "Must have at least six months of validity at time of entry", to mean that a passport must be six months old? It really means that the passport expiration date must be at least six months later than the date of entry. Thank you. Unfortunately first appointment we could get in dec 20 Your first stop should be the US Embassy in Morocco.
