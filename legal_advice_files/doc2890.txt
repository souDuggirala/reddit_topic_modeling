 So this morning, I was driving behind a car on the highway that was going pretty slowly and thought that I had plenty of distance between us. At one point, I didn't realize that she had slowed down even more and I was unable to brake in time and ended up rear ending her. We both pulled over to the shoulder with the assistance of someone from HERO assistance and the other driver called the police. After climbing out of my car and checking and photographing the damage on both vehicles, I could tell that my vehicle barely had any damage and hers had a little scratch and bump on the back. After the cop arrived, he checked us both for injuries and damage and asked if we even wanted to file a report since the damage was so little but, the other driver insisted on filing the report. She told the cop that she was injured and had hit her head when I had rear ended her. At the time, I was so shocked from being in my first accident that I didn't realize that I should have been more cautious in dealing with her. After we had exchanged contact information and spoke for a little while, she told me that she wasn't looking for money and that she was going to ask the cop if there was anything we could do to avoid going through the court system. Fire Rescue had also come at one point to check for injuries and she had refused to go with them. I did receive a citation for following too closely but now I'm concerned that this woman will try to scam me. Can someone give me any advice on what to do about my situation? If you are concerned, let your insurance company handle it. Their job is to protect you against these types of claims and you won't need to pay her anything out of your own pocket.  Open a claim with your auto insurance company and allow them to handle her claim as you pay them to do.
