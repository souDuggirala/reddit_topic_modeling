 I'm developing a website that allows me to compare vehicles between each other. Before I start I want to make sure it's legal for me to actually use those cars on my website. This is not a blog and these vehicles wont be rated by anyone, they will just have their specifications listed with a couple of pictures. This is free advertising for these companies, but I assume some car manufacturers would still not like this. I'm aware video games have to request licenses to use real life cars in their games. Which laws would I have to follow in the case of a website? I assume copyright laws aren't the same in every country, is it the country where the owner of the website (me) is located? I'm in Belgium right now, but the website will target Belgium and US users. Thank you! So you want to create a website /blog about cars? Yes. Perfectly legal. There are millions of sites that use car company names all the time.
