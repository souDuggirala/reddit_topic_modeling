NC- My s/o works in a school and she has some crazy parents that come in to talk to her. As I read it North Carolina is a one-party consent state.  Is she allowed to record their conversations in her office without notifying the parents since she is one part of the partyâ€™s? &gt; You are correct, however I argue that NC 15A-287 cannot be against school policy

That law protects you from being prosecuted for recording a conversation.

It does not protect you from being fired for recording a conversation.

From your own link above:

&gt;Now, **the mere fact that the law provides that recording is lawful where only one party consents does not mean that the employee has a right to record.  Just because it is lawful does not mean that it has to be permitted.** 

And the e-f sections you quote above only apply to law enforcement investigations - the plaintiff is not going to get a electronic surveillance order to record the mean parents. [deleted] &gt; The school can not restrict your constitutional right to record the conversation.

True.

But they can definitely fire you for violating school policy.

Kind of an important part, that second part. [deleted] Good idea thank you for that. Yes, in North Carolina there is the one-party consent law, meaning you can record a phone call or conversation so long as you are a party to the conversation.  However, it may be against school board policy. OP's SO should check with their supervisor or the principal before recording parents during school-related events and conversations. That's the intent of the law; yes. The only crime in the scenario you've described is that apostrophe.
