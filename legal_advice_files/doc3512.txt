 What to do if a supervisor alters truck driving log records after an accident to conceal that they were violating DOT regulations? I know they have a duty to preserve evidence as soon as litigation is expected. is there any way for them to get the original records? and what are the potential consequences if they fail to provide the original driving record? Ianal-am truck driver. There is always a way to see log alterations, even with paper logs. DOT will use cameras, fuel receipts, scale crossings, as well as elog alteration records.  It will depend on the spoliation sanctions in your state and whether or not you can prove your allegations.
