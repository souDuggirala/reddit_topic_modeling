 As I understand (correct me if I’m wrong) in California if I a show up to a scheduled shift and they turn me away I’m entitled to half the days pay. I’ve contacted HR about the issue and they’ve asked for text message timestamps between my boss and I, however when my boss cancels the shifts it’s always over the phone. (He works remote) His excuse to not paying me is “I assumed you weren’t going to show up,” which makes absolutely no sense as I always arrive early and cover for him constantly. Do I need his consent to record the phone calls? I have a new job lined up, but while my security clearance processes I’m stuck with this job. At this point I have thousands of dollars in lost wages due to being turned away from my scheduled shifts. Would I have a case for small claims or should I cut my losses and move on.   Talk to an employment attorney or file a retaliation complaint with the Labor Commissioner's Office Sounds like you were [illegally retaliated]() against for demanding the wages you were due ---- If you go the attorney route, talk to them about your unemployment filing as well Full time and all of my scheduled shifts are 12 hour shifts.  I have been trying but it’s the same thing every time, they keep telling they’re going to check in with him and nothing is done. Since I’ve done that I’ve been completely taken off the schedule I suspect in retaliation for going over his head.  I’m pretty sure you have to at least work 2 hours to be paid for that 4 hours if turned away for a scheduled shift. Are you part time or full time?   That has to be at least two hours worth of pay, and it maxes out at four hours, but otherwise [yes]() Talk to HR about contacting them immediately after the call for confirmation that you're available or something. And keep your own log as well
