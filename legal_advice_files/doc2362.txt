 Probably a pretty obvious problem for some, but is there anything against a police officer blocking my ability to see them coming? Is this entrapment? I felt somewhat violated, especially considering it was only for a noise complaint. It's legal, but so what? Don't answer the door for someone who covers the peephole. I'm imagining a certain amount of splash back.  Who cares whether it is illegal or not? You are crazy if you open your door without knowing who it is, especially if they are intentionally hiding their identity. I agree with the other poster who said to call 911. The officers should have been holding their creds up to the peephole so you could be sure that it is actually the police. Not illegal for the police to do this. It is also not illegal for you to shout through the door, "I'm not opening the door unless you step away from the peephole so I can see who you are!" then calling 911 to report the attempted entry by an unknown individual. Thank you for your insight Right. My b.  Probably best not to laugh when the cops cover your peehole. That may not end well.  I can’t stop laughing.  Highly unlikely that it’s illegal, NAL  No it’s not illegal and it’s certainly not entrapment. Yes, that's legal. Also, I initially read this as "peehole."
