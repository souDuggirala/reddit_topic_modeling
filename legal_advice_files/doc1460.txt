 I previously had a withdrawal order in place (because he refused to pay until it was forcibly taken), and this was in action for ~3-4yrs. But he was recently fired from his job, and I know I won't receive anything until he gets a new job, but I don't know how to have the withdrawal order "transferred" to the new job (whenever he gets it) if that's even possible, or if I need a new one entirely. If I need a new one, can I file this myself? Or do I have to get a lawyer to petition again? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.
