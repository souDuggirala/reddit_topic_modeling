 He was arrested and charged with domestic violence 3. I immediately moved out (we had previously lived together) and have distanced myself from him. All this being said though he is essentially the only family I have left and I don't want to see him face charges. I talked to the police initially in a attempt to have the charges dropped, but I learned that it was not an option to drop charges. I then filled out a formal request, which the police provided for me, for the district attorney to drop the charges. That was the last I had heard until today when the police came to my workplace and subpoenaed me as a witness against my father. I don't wish for my father to face any charges for this and I want to do anything possible to help his case. What are my options, and what is best for my father and myself at this point? In such cases all you can do is go and tell the truth. The police and prosecutor decide whether to go forward, not the victim. When you subpoenaed you are obligated to appear. You are also obligated to testify. I understand how you feel, but you might want to consider looking into some counseling related to domestic violence. A relative who would assault you is not someone you want to be around in your life.  Your legal options are to comply with the subpoena and not commit purgery when you do.   Go and tell the truth. If you don't remember, stating "I don't recall" is perfectly fine. But for Cthulhu's sake, don't lie.
