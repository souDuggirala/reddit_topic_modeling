My dad all of a sudden started acting pretty much insane. He talks to himself and people who aren't there and seeing things and believing things that aren't there. He ended up finally getting arrested this morning for trying to break into 3 different cars and breaking a lady's window. At first we thought maybe he was on drugs, but his drug test was clean besides for weed. But weed isn't going to cause someone to hallucinate like that. My family and family friends think it's a good possibility maybe he has a brain tumor because this is very odd behavior for him. Is there anything I can do or the jail can do to arrange something for him to have a brain scan to test? He's been seen by a doctor but they just do a normal exam unless told otherwise and my dad isn't logical enough to say something let alone believe it. Please help I'm very worried about him. There's also a possibility he can't be bailed out and that he wouldn't willingly go to the hospital. This isn't with reason. There's no explanation for his behavior. I'm asking if there's something I can arrange there not if they do it automatically. I know that or I wouldn't have asked. If he has a brain tumor his charges might be able to be lifted. Lots of people go into jail exhibiting odd behavior, for any variety of reasons.  They're not going to scan them for brain tumors.  They will generally only address acute, emergent, life threatening conditions.

Get him bailed out of jail and get him to a doctor.
