 I recently purchased a Samsung range, that on both the Samsung website and the Best Buy website, that it had WiFi capabilities. When we received the range, it does not have WiFi at all. This was a big reason for us for purchasing this range, as we wanted to make a Smart Kitchen. Is this considered false advertising? What can we do? Samsung just told us that we should just get the older model, but it doesn't have a bridge element like the one we purchased, and so we don't really want that one. I know it sounds like we are being picky brats, but shouldn't I be if I pay $1100 for an oven? (Rhetorical.) Is this worth threatening a lawsuit?
