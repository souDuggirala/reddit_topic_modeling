 I’m researching the use of texts in intent to distribute cases and have a question. If Person A texted Person B about a drug deal 2 years in the past, would the police be able to charge Person A with intent to distribute if they found these texts? I’m more curious if the police were searching Person B’s phone for a different reason, but stumbled across these texts, could the police charge Person A solely off of these texts? Thank you! In MA, there is no crime whose only element is intent to distribute. There's distribution, and possession with intent to distribute. So the texts alone wouldn't be enough evidence, but they could be used as one piece of evidence. But keep in mind, the bar for charging someone with a crime is much lower than the bar for convicting someone.  Generally speaking, text messages can certainly be used as evidence of a crime. Would the police make an arrest solely based off of finding a series of two year old messages? /r/legaladvice isn't able to read the mind of the local PD, we're not going to be able to answer that question. /r/legaladviceofftopic would be the place for hypotheticals
