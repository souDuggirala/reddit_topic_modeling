 Thank you, I'm considering the "similar but not the same" spiritual successor kind of mod then. That's not really something we can answer here, and nobody is going to encourage you to do something illegal. But that would only happen if they want to pursue, no? I am aware they could do so whenever they want to, but many other IPs are used for this purpose (see hundreds of warhammer or lotr or asoiaf related mods) even when those are actively producing games. Nope, using their characters and storyline is infringing on their IP. While being in another country might shield you from some of the heavier damages, a C+D will likely get the game removed from any website you attempt to distribute it on.
