 I was supposed to be given an ADHD medication. Risperdone is an antipsychotic that's never supposed to be prescribed long term. I, two years under the minimum recommended age to take it, was on it for three years. It caused severe weight gain (BMI over 35), oversized breasts (i cup, but female, but nothing like this in the family), and though migraines run in the family, mine are significantly worse. Once one lasted a month type of worse. All known Risperdone side effects, which started with it and never left. I am now off it and an adult, but will need migraine medication for the test of my life. What can I get for what has happened to me? There have been some lawsuits against the company that makes Risperdone - - it wouldn't hurt you to get a free consultation with a lawyer to see if you have a case. I was not monitored as far as I know, and only saw the doctor a couple times. There was no treatment until mom noticed two years later. She wouldn't take me off them though until another doctor said fine, which was a while. There is no way my circumstances were extreme enough, I was functional without medication, just better on it. You can try consulting with a medical malpractice attorney in Maryland, with all of the details of your history and medical records. Med-mal is very fact-specific, and nobody on the internet is going to be able to tell you whether or not you have a case. (Most med-mal attorneys will give free consultations.) Note, however, that a successful case would need to prove that no reasonable doctor would have prescribed risperdone under the circumstances, and that is a tough hurdle. The drug is approved for long-term use in certain situations; whether you fit into those situations may or may not be clear. Just because you got the side effects is not \necessarily\ evidence that the doctor did anything wrong. Did the doctor monitor you for side effects, for example, and/or make an effort to ameliorate those effects?
