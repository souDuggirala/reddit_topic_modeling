 Before I write a diatribe, I wanted to ask if anyone was actively looking into the legality of fees tacked on to cell for late payments. I understand why they are there but the cost of them (what you pay for example to get your phone turned back on) does not require that amount of money. I am not a lawyer, and this is much less severe then some other post, but if you can help, message me. [removed] Generally these fees are outlined in the contract you sign when you obtain service. Read your contract and see if you agreed to be charged these fees.
