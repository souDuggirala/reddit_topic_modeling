 Not to my knowledge, the reason for the signing was because they tend to have the houses completed soon, so rather than rush to sign everything they had me come early. I just want a date, or between these dates and I cannot seem to get that.  Well you just re-signed correct? I'd bet its two years from the new date. By re-signing, I'm sure you've extended the contract. Why else have you re-sign? That’s what I was thinking, so they have another year basically   So the contract says, "The builder has 2 years and 180 days to deliver a house," but it doesn't say when that timeline begins? I'm not a lawyer but I would think the reasonable assumption would be that it would start the day of the contract's signature, if no other date is given. I have not had a lawyer review. So I like to have a plan, I got an apartment and did the lease so that if need be I could use the 3 month to months they allow, December is the 3rd month and they will not allow anymore. I can rent but I don’t have the money to get an apartment for 1 month then break the lease and pay that, hence having the plan to not have to worry about a place to live but that’s all all the window now. I’ll find something but it’s just a major hassle and headache when I can’t plan anything because they won’t give a date. Am I crazy for asking for a date? Can’t that be given? Did a lawyer review your agreement? Why can't you rent? They have 2 years and 180 days but they never gave a date from the beginning. I have blue prints that I signed for but not address, unit number etc. I have the cost and all the signed documents, I just signed again since it’s been a year since my last signature and they claim to be close but yet won’t say this (date).  What do the documents say? You should have timelines, costs, blueprints, and contracts.
