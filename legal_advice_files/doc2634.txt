 My friend got a hot tub in his house that we love to hang out in and use. We all have a fun time but the jets are super strong and some of my other friends joke with him about how they're going to sue after the hot tub rips their skin off. For his birthday I was going to get him a framed binding arbitration and class action notice waiver to hang on the wall next to the hot tub as a gag gift and inside joke. Would there be any legal problems by doing this? Would the document have to say that it's not a real document? For fuckâ€™s sake, write up whatever you want. Put a tiny disclaimer on the bottom if you want. Those waivers are largely unenforceable so who cares? Also, get super creative with the language!
