 I received a rogue text last night. I asked who they were and did a reverse phone search to see if it was someone I knew. It was a random generic type name. He proceeded to ask who I was and I refused to divulge the info since I have no clue who this is. He then sent me a screenshot from Tracers Info Online and it includes everything, former name, address and SSN. Along with the info of the person who formerly owned my phone number. He then introduced himself as a Private Investigator and that he has no clue why he has my number in his phone. I'm clearly not a part of a legal case or it would have been better organized than that. I cant imagine that a PI on a real case would go about doing what he just did to me if I was a part of a case. So my question is, if this person is truly a PI and using his reference tools such as Tracers, to look up a random phone number and send that info to said phone number, is this legal? What if it wasn't me though? Now some random person would have ALL of that information he sent to me in a screen shot. I'm frustrated and I'm not sure if there's a line that's been crossed. It's legal because there is no law saying it's not legal. Last statement. I'm concerned about this because my identity has already been compromised. I fully understand he's a PI and that the laws are a little different. But.. I'm looking for an explanation as to how it's legal to send pictures of my private information to a unconfirmed phone number. I feel violated. Yes Is it legal to disperse information such as the Tracers info, to a person who may or may not be the person that the information belongs to? Legal
