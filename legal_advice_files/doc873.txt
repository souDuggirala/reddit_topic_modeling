 Reported my in-laws shitty neighbors for leaving their dog curled up in a ball on their porch when there’s windchills of -30 outside, left out for hours. Left my name and DOB with dispatch because they asked, I just don’t want to be involved in anything IF anything happens to the owners. Obviously speaking up for the dog is always the right thing to do, I just don’t want my name anywhere with it, but I probably could’ve asked to remain anonymous. Oh well. What can happen?
