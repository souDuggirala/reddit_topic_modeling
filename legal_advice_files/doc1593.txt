 Can my parents take documents I need notarized to a notary without me present.  How does that make me ungrateful. They are supporting me with this and I thanked them repeatedly. I canâ€™t go to the notary cause Iâ€™m usually in school during that time.  Feel bad for your dad man, having ingrateful son like that ðŸ˜ž They have the passport. I travel all the time.  I would make sure they have the passport. Also, most notaries where I am are office workers- secretary, bank worker etc. so it might be possible to get it done pretty easily if you just need notary. I always call my bank and ask if someone is working that can notarize. The parental authorization paper only needs my passport number. The rest is signed by the attorney or whatever and by my parent. All they need for me on that paper is name and passport number.  If they are all papers authorized by parents they can go without you, but if you are signing them or they are from you the notary needs to see you. Well shit. Where do I send these papers to get Apposiled  No, you need to sign it in the notary's presence. That's the whole point
