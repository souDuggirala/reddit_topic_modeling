 Story Time (shortened): 1. Buyer purchases Item 2. I pack and send item, from CO to ME 3. Buyer says they made mistake and request refund. 4. I say: "NP, return package to post office, unopened, Return-To-Sender" 5. Get Package Back - realized he opened the package and swapped the merchandise 6. I message buyer about it 7. Buyer responds by changing username and claims to be someone else 8. Buyer follows up with A - Z Guarantee Claim 9. I could not defend the claim, buyer wins, I am now down item plus refund and shipping. Ouch 10. Months later, I am organizing browser bookmarks, rediscover the bookmarks I made of Buyer's Social Media while finding anyway to defend claim 11. It's there that I find Buyer sharing photos and video of my stolen merchandise. Now that I have indisputable proof against him, I wish to take him to court. I asked how to proceed earlier and was suggested to file a Civil Lawsuit, however, considering the space between us, I don't know how practical that can be. Does anyone have any success stories, general tips to follow, or better suggestions? This isn't a "success stories" type of subreddit. Generally, to sue someone in another state, you have to go to that state or hire a lawyer there. There are very limited exceptions, which probably do not apply here.
