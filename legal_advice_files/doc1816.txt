 Myself and 2 friends are traveling from Canada to Miami this February and are hoping to travel to Cuba for a few days before coming home. I know there are restrictions on travel from the US to Cuba that prohibit tourist travel there. But from what I've read on Reddit it seems like they are quite lax and not subject to scrutiny if you're in the US and going to Cuba. My concern is that when I'm at the US customs desk in Canada they'll inquire about my visit reasons to Cuba. My plan is to use the following travel reason as per the American regulations: ยง 515.564 Professional research and professional meetings in Cuba. (a)General license - (1)Professional research. The travel-related [transactions](=840 height=800 iframe=true def_id=bae10876873f99c23051782f9aee6556 term_occur=1 term_src=Title:31:Subtitle:B:Chapter:V:Part:515:Subpart:E:515.564) set forth in [ยง 515.560(c)]() and such additional [transactions](=840 height=800 iframe=true def_id=bae10876873f99c23051782f9aee6556 term_occur=2 term_src=Title:31:Subtitle:B:Chapter:V:Part:515:Subpart:E:515.564) as are directly incident to professional research are authorized, provided that: (i) The purpose of the research directly relates to the traveler's profession, professional background, or area of expertise, including area of graduate-level full-time study; (ii) The traveler's schedule of activities does not include free time or recreation in excess of that consistent with a full-time schedule of professional research. Example to [ยง 515.564(a)(1)](): The making of a documentary film in Cuba would qualify for the general [license](=840 height=800 iframe=true def_id=bf63a77edefdc4313fdedf1cf939ebaf term_occur=1 term_src=Title:31:Subtitle:B:Chapter:V:Part:515:Subpart:E:515.564)in this section if it is a vehicle for presentation of the research conducted pursuant to this section. I'm currently a medical resident in Canada and plan to say that I am going to Cuba to interview the general public and gauge attitudes to mental health in Cuba as part of a research project I am starting. I hope to meet with physicians there and survey them as well. Am I taking a massive risk with this whole thing? Or do you think that I'm pretty safe with this plan? How much would US customs care about my travels to Cuba?
