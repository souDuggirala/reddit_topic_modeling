 MA: My aunt placed my grandmother, who has dementia and is recovering from a stroke in an elderly home. The quality of care there is abysmal and it is financially unsustainable for her to be there long. If my mother and her remaining siblings want my grandmother released into their care does my aunt's medical proxy prevent them from doing so? No one has no power of attorney for my grandmother. You're right, I should have been more specific. Me saying not bothering to participate was quite harsh. My aunt did state she does not want to be involved any longer but has made this decision w/o involving anyone else. Depends on the terms of her estate planning documents, which no one has seen. You can go to an elder law attorney and ask for an opinion on that question. Do be a bit more charitable than saying that someone didn't want to "bother participating in my grandmother's care." Caring for someone with stroke and dementia can be insanely taxing, can lead to marital failure, and can cause major health effects on the care provider. It's also not a given that the aunt was even able to provide an appropriate level of care for your grandmother.
