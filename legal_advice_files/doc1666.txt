 I had been in a bad relationship with my boyfriend and our lease ended last June. I got my own apartment for myself and told him he needed to find his own place. He got extremely upset about me not giving him any time to find his own place and him not having any money for a place. His lack of keeping and getting a job is one of the problems. So I felt bad and let him stay with me in my new apartment until he got on his feet. But he hasn't kept a job more than a month so he's never helped out financially. So finally I told him I'm giving him until the end of February to get out. But he said I can't kick him out because he's been living here. Now I freaking out. No. Do I need to tell my apartment manager to give him a written notice?  [removed] If he has been staying there more than 30 days he is a tenant and must be properly evicted. If this is the case you must give him proper written notice to vacate (30 days). If he refuses to leave after that then you must evict him. If he has been staying there more than 30 days he is a tenant and must be properly evicted. Landlords cannot get rid of tenants by calling the police.  Give him written 30 day notice to vacate, and if he fails to leave after that, file for a formal eviction with the courts. If he isn’t on the lease and won’t leave call the cops.
