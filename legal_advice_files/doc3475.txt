  A 24-year old professional degree student in his 27-month of study of a 32-month Master’s degree had a college arbitrarily and capriciously remove him from a course, for what they state in writing, was ‘a failure to conduct himself in a professional manner’. Then they followed up within 6 days and dismissed him from college, without student hearing or rights as outlined in their handbooks. The main administrator involved basically gave him no right to appeal. On probing further, the office of registrar, also in writing, wrote that he was dismissed for academic reasons, even though he was at the top of his class. There is written proof of these discrepancies and he is seeking significant financial restitution, as he otherwise would have graduated in May 2019 and most likely will not be able to reenter another physician assistant program as acceptance rate is below 5%. Who could be the right lawyer for this? How expensive might this be if the student has extensive paper and audio documentation of pertinent events?  If he is willing to invest in a lawyer for legal recourse, he can certainly do so.  I’m guessing you don’t know the whole story. The school likely had a good reason to not advance him through the PA course. If he would like to pursue legal options, he could contact to state bar in his area for an appropriate referral.
