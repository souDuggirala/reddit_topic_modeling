 Hi about a month ago a received a traffic ticket for no seatbelt. It was my very first ticket ever and I’ve never been in trouble with the law ever. My ticket was due today at 1;00, I did not know that tickets had a time deadline along with a date. I paid the ticket this evening when I got home for work, how much trouble am I in? I’m so scared You made a reddit account to ask this? Instead of just using google? It would have been much faster than creating an account
