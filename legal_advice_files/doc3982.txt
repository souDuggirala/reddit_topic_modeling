 Thanks for the help folks, I know this might sound paranoid but I need to know if it is illegal to send or receive photos of your own kids/nieces/nephews of them in the bath? A friend has a family group chat of him, brother, brothers wife, grandmother, and grandfather. Apparently every once in a while the brother and wife will share funny photos of the kids goofing off doing what kids do. But sometimes this includes the kids goofing off in the bath, as was the case with a photo of the kids making a mess with a bubble bath. For reference these kids are around 3 and 5 I believe. I understand from their point of view its family and isn't being used nefariously but I also understand the law doesn't always care and I fear they might misinterpert it such as with this [Arizona family](=on utm_term=.0447e26aa3da) Is this illegal?
