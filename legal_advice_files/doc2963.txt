 First of all, I'm not sure if legal advice is what I need but here goes... I am a partner in a Brazilian company which had an American bank account at Bank of America. Anyway, cut to June of last year, Bank of America closed our account without any warning and refused to tell us why, they maintained that they had the discretion to not tell us the reason. I never found out why, we were always a legit company not involved in anything illegal or questionable. However at the time our account was closed we heard several stories of Iranian-Americans and Brazilians getting their BoA accounts closed as well, so we figured something strange was up and that it had something to do with accounts belonging to foreigners. Anyway, we had about $6,000 in our account. I called them to figure out how we can get our money back and they informed us that we could get the check sent to us. They claimed they sent the check butwe never received it. Over the past 8 months I've called them several times to figure out what was up and they always claimed that the checks were sent to our address here in Brazil. Every single time I call BoA, I spend on average 2-3 hours on the phone being forwarded around to what seems like the entire company. It's always someone else's department. I just got off the phone just now, I spent about 3 hours being transferred around, got hung up on twice, and have no result out of it. We can not physically go to a branch of the bank since we are not in the United States. However it seems that ultimately one of us will have to go there just because of this. I want to know if there is any other way we can look into getting our money back and if that could involve lawyering up. You can appoint someone in the states power of attorney and they can go into the bank on your behalf. I would contact BOA and see if they have a required for you would have to execute, or other specific requirements, in order for someone to act on your behalf.
