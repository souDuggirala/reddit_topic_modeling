 A collection agency has apparently been trying to collect from me since 2015 as I have two bills of $1000 dollars that were never paid. However, I have never been there. I am not sure how to go about this. I'm from Arizona.  Look up how to do a debt validation letter. Check your credit report. Dispute the debt with the three companies of it appears there.
