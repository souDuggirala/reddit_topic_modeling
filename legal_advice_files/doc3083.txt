 Hi. Hope this is the right place for this. Long story short I wanted a new doctor because mine was always at least an hour and a half late for every appointment and I just didnt click with her. I made an appointment with a new psychiatrist and they said they needed my records before they could refill my controlled substances. I started calling my "old" doctor over a month ago to get my records sent. Sometimes the line just keeps ringing other times the answering service takes a message. My new doctor has called a few times a week. No records have been sent. I filed a complaint with the state board for professionals but is there anything else I can do? I really want my sleeping pills refilled. Thanks! I would go down in person as you will most likely have to prove your are you or send a certified letter (return receipt requested) notarized and requesting copies of your medical chart. In the meantime, maybe your new doctor can evaluate you and write a prescription for you.  Under federal HIPAA law, a provider has 30 days to provide you or your new doctor a copy of your medical records, or provide a written explanation on the delay, then they have 60 days from the original request to provide the records. If these timelines are not met, you can file a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights so they can be investigated for breach of HIPAA law.
