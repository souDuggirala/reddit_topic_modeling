 I'm starting a new business with the intent of creating educational videos for Youtube and other platforms. Is it necessary to apply for a trademark for the company name and/or tagline, or is that unnecessary at this stage? I may be overthinking it, but any guidance would be appreciated.  Thanks, guess I'll stop being a cheapskate and go for it! It’s always good to trademark these things. It’s not my place to judge your idea and whether it’s worth it but legally you should do it to be on the safe side.
