 At the end of last year I received a medical bill from 2015. I had my insurance company send a Explanation of Benefits from the time frame in question and it looks like my insurance company was billed, but they never sent the bill to me for my portion (incidentally the billing company is saying I owe three times the amount my EOB says it should be) I checked how late they could send a bill and found this ( []() ) and it looks like they are two years late in sending. Do I respond to the billing company that I don't owe based on the statute above, ignore it, or am I missing something and do owe the amount in question.
