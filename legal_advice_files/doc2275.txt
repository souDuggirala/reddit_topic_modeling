 Me and my old friend started an LLC a few years back. We put some money into an account , always 50/50( contributing equal amounts into the account). Unfortunately nothing ever happened of our business. Anyways. We both put $1500 each into the account... fast forward to recently we had a falling out. Hes become very angry and erratic to me and all our mutual friends... so I thought just to be safe , incase he takes all our money and runs, I would take my half out and start to dissolve the LLC. So I took my half out and called it a day. So my partner came screaming into my normal place of work saying he got a call from the bank asking if he wants to take "legal action" for me taking money out he was saying he needed to be notified before I took out money(which I never heard of.we are both signers on the account, no limitations) . Hes really considering Sueing me. What am I getting sued for? Is he trying to trick me or scare me here? He also said he wants to keep the LLC and just have me remove myself completely. Could this be another trick on his hand somehow legally? I'm really distraught here and just want to make the right choice.
