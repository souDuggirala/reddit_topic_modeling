 I worked at a place of employment from 2016-2018 from when I was 15 - 16. I was denied W-2s for tax returns both years and thought that was just how things worked until now. I have started a much better job as I was fired for speaking up against management for activities that I felt we're unethical, yeah I know bad idea, but this was spurred from the General Manager being reported for sexual misconduct for half a year and only being "let go" after they thought he was stealing, this lead to low moral and distrust in the authority at such workplace. I wonder am I entitled for my W-2 forms this year if I go in and request them? I will be 17 in Feb. Oy. Shame on your parents then, not you. They should have known better and guided you properly. This will now not be as simple as requesting a copy of your W2. You should have your parents ask a tax attorney about how to handle this now. You have to file a return, even if you get a full refund. Likewise, you should have filed a state tax return as well.  That's the thing they, my former employer said that we didn't do them as minors and the idiot I am, I didn't file returns. How did you file your tax returns without a W2? Did you e-file?  Thanks you for your time. You can ask a parent or legal guardian to help you navigate this situation. All the info you need can be found in the IRS website.  Is their a place that I could do that online or is it a situation I would have to go into a gov. building? I am not the most literate when it comes to legal things like this. You can request a copy of your W2s directly from the IRS.
