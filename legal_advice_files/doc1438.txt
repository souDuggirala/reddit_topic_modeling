 Hey guys, so I got a civil ticket in the mail from Violationinfo for passing a school bus in Texas. They sent me mail with the ticket number, and when I went online (you can only pay online or over the phone) to pay I found that I have lost the paper with my ticket number on it. It's due tomorrow, and the phone line is closed Saturday and Sunday, and it's closed at the time of calling today. I can't get the ticket number until Monday, and I can't pay without knowing the ticket number. So, what should I do? One additional thing (Sorry OP) ummm Monday is a federal holiday. Plan for Tuesday.  Fabulous! Haha thanks so much, but I found it! That would be up to the court.  Lame, I wonder if I could convince them to drop the late fee since they were closed on the due date. I really had to scrape things together to pay it as is lol Well, there will be a late payment charge now. So you will need to call and find out the amount and pay it over the phone or find the amount and the ticket number and pay it online. Either that or search your house and your car and see if you can find it. Maybe you will be lucky and do so. Then you can pay it on time.
