 Now, idk if the officer was in the right or if he was in the wrong, there are possible more to the story but this is all we have so far. There was a fight that broke out in a high school cafeteria and things got really heated, some security officers tried to contain the situation and one person in particular, grabbed a girl’s head by her hair and slammed it on a table. I don’t know who the girl is, but I go to this school district and everyone is going bananas over this situation. People are saying the security officers were doing their jobs and other people are saying that it was a case of police brutality. Watch the video here: =21
