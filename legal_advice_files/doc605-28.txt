I park on the street in between my driveway and my neighbors driveway.  It's either I park there or 50m away from my doorway. I've been parking there ever since I bought a car (3-4 month ago) and everything was normal. Winter season hit so now it's time to shovel (Canada).  He decides to shovel his entire driveway and the sidewalk and starts to pile the show up where I park. Now my car doesn't have a spot to park anymore. I'm pretty sure it is illegal to stack show up on the street. How do I legally gain my spot back?

This neighbor guy has done many things to define him as a douche. I have caught him stealing water from the side of my house (I received the middle finger when confronting him about this). He constantly throws garbage over the fence into my yard. Stares at my family and others when entering or leaving the house. Since then, I have blocked the tap on the side of my house and cleaned my yard accepting my defeat. I do not know how to solve this one. Please help :(

 Nal but I am pretty sure that 1. It is illegal to pile snow on the road from ones driveway. And 2 you are not allowed to park on the side of the road overnight as it impedes snow plows. You may get ticketed for it if you do it.  
Source. Am canadian home owner myself who drives. :)  Grab a shovel, and ask if your neighbor can dump his snow somewhere else? 

Not much a legal question here, just work something out with them if there's another place that they can dump.
