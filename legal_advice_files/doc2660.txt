 I live in Alberta. My SO works in masonry. The company is very small,usually 4-6 employees and the boss' wife does the administrative side of things, including pay. His boss switched him over from hourly wage to piece work in July 2018, so he submitted his square footage rather than hours. But it looks like on his pay stubs that they left him categorized as "Salary". This has been an ongoing issue in which they justified it by saying they have it on paper as him working $40/hour. SO was laid off back in mid January with his boss assuring him he'd be returning to work by mid-February. He filed for EI immediately but his ROE hadn't been submitted. He continuously checked in with his boss, asked for a copy, asked where it was, and was waved away with "our accountant is working on it". His boss' wife sent me an email with my SO's "Office Copy Only" ROE, which only reflected the work he had done for 2019. SO requested she correct it. She did, but now the insurable earnings are $10k less than what he made for the year. The cheque amounts listed on the ROE reflect the correct amount he earned but not the insurable earnings. I checked out the [CRA website]() and let the wife know about the "piece work" section and needing to apply that to his ROE so that his EI can be reflective of what he's actually allowed to receive. They haven't followed up with this at all. My SO quit his job today - and now, because he was given a couple "advances" (his boss initially said it was a top up for the months work was slow), his boss won't return my SO's tools until it's paid back. TL;DR: SO's boss messed up his ROE, won't fix it and has yet to submit it, SO can't apply for EI because of it, SO quit, now boss is claiming what were essentially "gifts" were advances and won't return my SO's tools without paying it back.
