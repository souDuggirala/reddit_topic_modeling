 This isn’t for me but I have a friend who has been living in her apartment for two years and her landlord wants to renovate the apartment. She was asked to move into one of the other apartments that have already been renovated, but told she has to put down another down payment. Is this legal considering they already have a down payment for the same amount at the same apartment complex? Then i would ask them to transfer. No. They didn’t state she would get it back. Is she getting back the down payment for the other apartment? Unless they didn't pay enough or something, I'm not sure why they would need another. You're most likely missing an important detail.
