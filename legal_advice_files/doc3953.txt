 Pretty much as the title says. In Salt Lake City (UT). Have one year lease and a lot of problems with the house and landlords. Agreed with landlords I could break lease if I found someone. I've found multiple suitable tenants but the landlords rejected all. I am guessing they are going to reject everyone until the end of the lease and in the mean time they are making my life really difficult. Any help would be much appreciated.  With one person, they gave a very general reason as in "their situation was complicated" but nothing more detailed. Otherwise, they don't even let me know that they rejected a candidate, I have to contact the candidates and find out. Do they give you a reason they are rejecting them like they failed a credit check or something? I'm still living there. We agreed that I would abide by the lease and live there until we find a new tenant. I know by law, if a tenant wants to break a lease, the tenant is responsible for rent until the landlord find a new tenant and that the landlord must make an effort to find a tenant. I made the effort to find a tenant and found several. The landlords have rejected them. I don't know what the law is though on whether the landlord is required to sign with a new tenant or not. If not, I don't quite understand what the point of the effort requirement is. They could make an effort to find a tenant but always reject applicants. This is where I'm stuck.  Are you still living there or have you moved out already? Yes, I did. Edit: It's in an email exchange. Did you get the landlord's agreeance to find a replacement tenant in writing?
