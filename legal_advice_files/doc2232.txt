 Let's say for example someone bought myname.com and has it say "myname is a terrible person" is this legal? Could you sue for slander or anythign else?

Do not reply to this message as a comment. You'll need to be more specific. Not all state laws are alike. The examples you've used -- "…is a terrible person" and "…is a bitch" -- are both opinion, and as such are protected speech. If they said something more specific, like accusing you of having committed a crime or being infected with an STD, you may have a case for defamation if you can prove they're actually referring to you. (Keep in mind that names are not unique.) But it's unlikely to be worth pursuing unless it's actually causing you some harm. : For real. Some laws specifically define this as a form of criminal defamation. Probably. They just made cyber-bullying illegal in MI. Also could def be sued for defamation/libel/harassment, but IANAL, this is just my opinion. First name or full name? They regestered myname.com and it says myname is a bitch only its my actual name. Is there anything I can do?  Bought your website? Could you explain that to me? (Domain name you wanted to claim?) Sounds petty af btw. I love it US [removed] I know the person who bought my website and I was wondering what I could do. Sorry if I wasn't clear WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?
