 Technically I was driving someone else’s car for 5 months under the impression that it was mine and was waiting to get the title transferred. During this time the car got 4 parking tickets @ $100 a ticket. Also during this time i had to spend over that amount on repairs needed. I.E. replaced the windshield that was busted when I got the car and new rotors, breaks and tires. The car title was never in my name. While talking with the owner (who now wants to take me to court) he is threatening me saying I owe him for not only the tickets, but also for his time spent paying the tickets which is now what he says over $1000. I told him I wasn’t going to pay for the tickets because he wasn’t going to pay me for the repairs. Do I need to get a lawyer? Will this even hold up in court?  If you got the tickets, it wouldn't be unreasonable for the person who sold you the car to want to be reimbursed for the tickets. The "time spent paying the tickets" is less likely to be reimbursed. As for the repairs, that's a totally separate issue. Unless you had a warranty or an agreement to be reimbursed for the repairs, those are yours to pay. If you parked the car illegally and the car was ticketed, then the registered owner of the car can pay those tickets and then turn around and (likely successfully) sue you for the value of the tickets. $1000 This is probably unlikely to be awarded in a court. These are mutually exclusive things that one or both of you are trying to conflate. If you got tickets, pay the man for the tickets you got. If there was an agreement for repayment for repairs, then sue the person if they're not holding up their end of the bargain. What you can't do is decide to make what you owe them contingent on what they owe you -- those are separate issues that need to be handled separately and not made to be dependent on each other.
