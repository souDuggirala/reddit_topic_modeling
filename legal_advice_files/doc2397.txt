 I just started talking to a girl and it turns out she 17, I really like her, but her bday is in November. I'm pretty sure I've got a pretty good ethical decision in my head, but I want her so damn bad. any suggestions? When does she turn 18? It’s just not worth it. What if her parents even catch wind that you guys are talking about sex? (Assuming you are). I would tone it down. None of that is worth prison time or the damage to your reputation.  She's 17, just leave her alone and find someone else instead of waiting for "butbut she's technically barely mentally an adult now". You "just started talking to her" and already you "want her so damn bad" that you are seriously considering committing statutory rape? Run like the wind, bro, run like the wind. Without you location we can't say. Best to fishing in a bigger pond for a year and then come back if you feel the need. Why add grief to your life unnecessarily?  Where are you from? If its the US, do a quick google for your state's age of consent. You'd be surprised to find out that the age of consent is 17, or lower in special cases, in more than a few states. NAL, but the advice is solid.  What if shes the one that goes to prison It’s ok because when you get out of prison she’ll be 37.
