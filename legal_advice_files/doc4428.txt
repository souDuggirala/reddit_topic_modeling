 Asking for a friend. In Georgia is it a lawsuit worthy case to sue a company if they want you to shave your beard and you claim being Christian as a religious reason to not shave? Dress and grooming codes are legal. Your employer is free to require you to shave (or not shave) as a condition of continued employment. Some religious exemptions would apply. You'd have to have a sincerely-held religious belief as well as have your grooming standard be a part of that sincerely-held religious belief in order to be exempt, so long as that doesn't interfere with your main job duties (for example, if you're required to wear a gas mask and the beard makes that impossible to do). I am not aware of keeping facial hair as being a religious requirement or observance of the Christian faith. Anybody can sue anybody for anything. But dress codes are perfectly legal. Not me, but a coworker seems to think he can and sue them based off him being Christian and then making him shave. Claiming it could be a religious reason. So you're asking if you can make up a reason to get around a dress code?
