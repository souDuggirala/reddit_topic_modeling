 On the 14th of last month, I left the country for a work trip for two weeks. Apparently, also on that day, my landlord left a notice on my door with options for renewing my lease, which expires in mid April. I saw the notice after I got back, but apparently I missed some fine print... Yesterday I got home from work to a new notice stating that because I didn't respond to the last one by the 11th of this month, my lease now automatically renews for another 12 months, so I'm stuck in this place until April of next year! I'm trying to find a copy of my lease to see if there's anything in it about this, but isn't it standard for a lease to go month-to-month once the original lease expires? I'm not saying I absolutely want out of this place, but it seems really shady to me for a lease to automatically renew for 12 months without any input from me, especially when I really only had about 2 weeks to even think about it, and my lease doesn't expire for almost two months! It auto-renews based on the terms of the notice they sent me -_- And does it auto-renew for a full term or go to month-to-month? Damn, I just read through my lease and I have to let them know at least 60 days before the end of this lease if I don't want to renew.  Dang, well here's hoping my lease specifies month to month... Pennsylvania law is pretty mum on the subject of auto-renewals, so that generally means they're legal. If the auto-renew clause is outlined in your original lease, then that seems to indicate that the auto-renewal was legit. 't it standard for a lease to go month-to-month once the original lease expires? Yes, in the cases where the lease does NOT specify that it would auto-renew. First step is to dig the lease out and read it and see what it says about the matter. This is all going to be listed in your lease. That ultimately controls the terms of renewal.
