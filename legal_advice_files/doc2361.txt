 Due to being federal government property where these employees work and not state, are these institutions exempt from state labor laws, but not federal? Sorry, there are some posts in r/news about the federal employee union suing the federal government for not getting paid and I felt it was wrong due to they'll just accrue the expenses and pay later. Then I had someone say it was against some state laws not being paid regularly. I questioned that due to being federal employees and working in federally owned buildings. Regardless thank you I'll move it. This is a question for r/legaladviceofftopic Typically yes, the states cannot regulate the federal government unless the federal government consents to being regulated by the state.
