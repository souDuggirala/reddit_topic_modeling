 Basically the title, I looked at CA laws and from what I could tell I don't fall under any exemption for not qualifying for OT. Maybe someone has more insight that they could help me with. You're welcome. Good luck. I think I will do just that. thank you very much. You can contact the [DLSE](). They can't legally retaliate against you for doing so, but be aware, it will not make your relationship with your employer any easier. I already had a meeting and asked them to give me details as to what exactly they've determined that shows why I'm exempt from OT and they told me they can't...yet. So, yeah. Not sure what my recourse is from there. You should probably be deemed non-exempt, then, unless you fall under a different exemption. The first step would be to politely ask HR what exemption you fall under.  I make 60k. To qualify as exempt, your job needs to meet a number of requirements. You also need to meet a salary threshold. What is your salary? [Here is a pretty good explanation of the job requirements.]() The relevant laws are federal, not state. Based on the details you provide, you are near-certainly an exempt employee, which means you don't get overtime.
