 After med school, students have to complete a residency program before they can practice as doctors. However The Match is a process which pairs students with residency programs only giving a single option to each student. It’s pretty much saying study this specialty and move your entire life to this location and go to this program and accept this amount of pay for the next 2-4 years or else don’t become a doctor. Apparently the matching algorithm is pretty fair and won a Nobel prize but this still seems like something out of a dystopian novel. Where all the kids take an aptitude test then their leaders match them with what jobs they will do for the rest of their lives. Congress passed an antitrust exception (or something?) for the match when a lawsuit against it was gaining steam. So does this mean that all of this is just legal now and there’s nothing to be done? Or what course of action can be taken from here to get rid of the match? Btw sorry for any mistakes, this is my first post!  Post deleted. Legal theory needs to be posted on /r/legaladviceofftopic
