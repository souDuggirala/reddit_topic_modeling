 My heat has broken roughly every two weeks this whole winter. The landlord typically fixes it within 12 hours, but the "fix" is clearly temporary as the heat always breaks again two weeks later. Most of the time it happens during the night and I wake up to a 40-50 degree (F) apartment. Currently the landlord has just "fixed" the heat again, but I would bet anything that it will be broken again in two weeks. I've spoken to the landlord about finding a more permanent fix, and he basically says "we just fixed it, what do you mean?" And even though I'm certain it will break again in two weeks, I can't do anything until it actually breaks. And then he will "fix" it again and I'll be in the exact same spot. Is there anything I can do to compel him to replace the heating system, or at least try to fix it permanently?
