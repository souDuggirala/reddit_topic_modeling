 So my friend works for a hotel franchise in Southern California. She’s worked there for about 6 months + and now the owners she was originally employed for sold to new owners. These new owners are placing my friend and all other employees under a new probation period of the regular 3 months but they had already passed this period with the old owner. As I’m sure they will do nothing wrong to violate the probation period, I am very curious whether or not this is allowed or if there’s anything they can do about this situation? Thanks!  Thank you for replying! Thank you for your answer! That is legal. They could make the probation period 10 years if they wanted to. In most cases the term "probation" is meaningless, unless it restricts access to certain benefits. This is allowed. When a new owner buys a business all current employees are technically news employees. The new owners can put them through a 90 day probation if they want though I’m not sure what the reason for that would be.
