 In a big city and am wanting to transport a cooler across town to a tailgate. They have bird scooters everywhere which are the motorized scooters you can get on and off almost everywhere in the city. Iâ€™m wondering if all containers are closed is it legal to put a cooler on the motorized bird scooters and ride across town with it on there? Didn't think so [removed] [removed] The only issue with transporting sealed containers of alcohol could be with taking it over state lines, which isn't happening here. You're fine. It is in San Antonio, Texas  You answered it yourself. There is no crime anywhere in the US that I am aware of that takes issue with a sealed container of alchohol being transported on a motor vehicle.  Impossible to know since you did not put a location down. In general, yes, so long as you take proper steps to secure the cargo as to stop it from being a danger to others.
