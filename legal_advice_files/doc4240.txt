 I'm Isaiah Anthony Quinn. Mosaic hospital in Saint Joseph missouri hospital ruined my life. Trying to give me a name that wasn't mine. The trust issues caused a trauma that has made me lose everything. All the advocate did was apologize. Locals won't take my case.  Malpractice of any kind is very fact specific and it is unfortunately beyond the scope of this subreddit. If this is a medical question, it is highly recommended to speak with a medical malpractice attorney; your state's bar may be able to refer you to one. They typically work on contingency, meaning there is little up front cost to you. Similarly, consultations are typically free. It wouldn't hurt to meet with one, have them look over your info, and go from there. If this is a question about legal malpractice, you should seek the advice of a second unrelated attorney and/or report the matter to your state bar association" I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
