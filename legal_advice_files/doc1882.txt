 4 years ago my (at the time) boyfriend signed a 2 year lease with a mobile home. The mobile home itself he found through a separate company. After 2 years the mobile home company sold their land to a different company. The new company never had him renew his lease and he never really bothered with it either. He still owes the mortgage company around $500, but we moved out of the home a few months ago. He hasn’t paid any lot rent since. Now they are suing him for unpaid rent. Since he does not own the home yet he does not have the title. The mobile home company wants the trailer and for him to pay the past due rent. I’m not even sure what we should do about any of this. Should he just fail to appear and give the mobile home the trailer and pay the overdue rent? Should he appear and try to salvage things? Any advice is welcome and appreciated. Thank you in advance.
