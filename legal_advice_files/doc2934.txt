 I am from the UK. My ex lives in Hong Kong. Early last year, my ex boyfriend used my paypal to purchase something costing around ~£290. My paypal went into negative and I received phone calls to pay it off. I paid it myself as my ex boyfriend didn’t have the money. We broke up and he had still never given me the money a year later. Yesterday, he accidentally sent me £72 and £73 on paypal a few hours apart. He messaged me asking for me to return this money. Can this money be now mine if he was in debt to me, or not?   £72 and £73 on paypal a few hours apart. He messaged me asking for me to return this money. Legally, IF that money is real, you may keep it as a downpayment on their debt. You may have a different problem here: what you describe is a typical fake check scam variation, where the scammer sends a "mistaken" payment to a paypal user, then asks for the money back. A few weeks after the victim send the money back directly to the scammer, the original transfers are reversed since they were fraudulent (made with stolen credit cards, or a hijacked bank account) and the victim is out any money they sent to the scammer. I would keep that money in my paypal account for 2-3 months before spending it, just in case. yoink !! yours now :) You can reply asking where the other ~145 is.  You can keep it You don’t have to give it back.
