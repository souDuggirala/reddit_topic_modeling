I am a minor in USA.

My mother has a boyfriend who does many wrong things such as abusing my dog, verbally abusing my mother, and damaging my/my grandfather's property. Recently, he decided to damage/nearly destroy a laptop of mine (belongs to my father technically, who does not live with us as my parents are divorced). Is this a crime? He is not related to us in any way. He has damaged other property belonging to us previously. Also, what can I do for his other behavior as a minor?

From what you have described, it seems that your mother’s boyfriend may not be a safe person for you to be around. If he is injuring your animals and breaking your things when he is angry, his behavior could escalate further. I encourage you to speak to a safe person, such as a family member, teacher or friend’s parent, about what is happening.

If you are comfortable, you can locate your state on this list and call your state’s child abuse and neglect hotline. You can remain anonymous and reporter information is not revealed:

But thank you for the advice :) Your father can take action since it was his laptop.  I’d surrender my dog to a rescue before I’d allow him to be abused. Are you able to live with your father?  If you are in an abusive environment, you should ask your father to help you, or speak with a school counselor or teacher.
