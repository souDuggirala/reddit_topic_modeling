 Hi Reddit, throwaway cause I'm paranoid. Literal first post to Reddit, sorry if I'm breaking any rules. I have no idea what flair this would be under too. Long time lurker of Reddit but never posted, so again, yeah. I've been dreading having to write this post for a long time. Short story is, husband drove car under my name/insurance and got into an accident tonight. I'm in MN as I'm sure laws and whatnot will vary. He was not at fault whatsoever; was sitting at a red light and a car slid into him while stopped. Minimal damage to my car (bumper is slightly loose on one side, nothing bad) other car had what my husband described as minimal radiator damage (a tiny bit of smoke(?) coming from radiator in the front). Kicker is, husband is driving on a suspended license (has had 3 DWIs in the past, it's been almost 4 years since his last) and is not listed under my insurance/car whatsoever. He and other driver did wind up pulling off the main drag where the accident occurred and decided to NOT call the police. They did NOT exchange insurance information but did exchange names and phone numbers. Husband did tell me he told the other driver he did not have a license (which in my opinion was ungodly stupid. Perhaps morally responsible, but stupid nonetheless). I know I shouldn't be letting him drive the car, so spare me that bit, please. Wondering what the worst possible outcomes are here; do I need to take any action to protect myself as the owner of the car? Should I be worried that even though the police were not called that my husband is going to wind up in jail? I donâ€™t think anyone can prove anything to make him go to jail. Just pay cash and let it be done.  Don't pursue this. Don't get insurance companies involved. Pay for your damage out of pocket and put this behind you.
