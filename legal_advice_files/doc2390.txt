 Me and my girlfriend have been dating for a year and I’m about to turn 18 (she’s 17) and I’m scared for our future since we live in Virginia and I don’t think we have Romeo and Juliet laws. What should I do for the best case senecio? It's legal for an 18 year old to date a 17 year old. You're just friends in the eye of the law.  Amazingly this is the second such question in the last day, and not surprisingly the answer is the same: if you don't want a felony conviction and a spot on the registered sex offender list, don't have sex with a minor. You’re getting awesome advice.   ^^^scenario Don't do anything illegal during the period that you are 18 and she is not. Abstain?
