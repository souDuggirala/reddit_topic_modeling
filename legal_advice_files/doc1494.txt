 So my father is 50% owner in a company that does hvac and currently owns like 12 trucks He wants go give me one of the companyâ€™s truck for a first vehicle. There is a newer one that would be nice for me because I could use it for a long time possibly for after college He is worried because he says that he has to pay taxes on it if he buys it because he says that he would for some reason have to buy it from the company and pay taxes on it. Another worry of his is that he wants to give it to me for a good price because he wants me to pay for the truck. He wants to know how low he could sell it for to me and or how he could get it without paying taxes because he owns the business and his partner is ok with giving me the vehicle Okay. One of the corporate officers of the company needs to either sell it to you for a fair price or just give it to you. They can just sign the title, notate the mileage and you can take that down to the DMV and they will re-issue a title in your name. It's that simple.  He never has If your father's company owns 12 trucks I'm sure he's sold them before. Just follow the same process and he should be fine.  My dads main concern is that he will sell the truck for too low of a price and get audited. The company could sell the truck directly to you as long as an official signatory signed the title. Then you, as the buyer, would pay the tax.
