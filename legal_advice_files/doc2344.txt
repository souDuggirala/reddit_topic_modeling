 I want to live stream the new years countdown on local TV on YouTube. I get the channels for free so it's not piracy? Confused here. No. That would be a public performance of a copyright work, which is copyright infringement. Even if you get the channels for free your viewers don't. You would be distributing something that you don't have permission to distribute. The issue isn't whether you get the channels for free, it's whether you have the channel's permission to stream the event; which you don't. It can still be piracy, since your viewers would be considered to be pirating it. Just don't do it. It's pretty simple. dont think you'll go to jail you'll just get copy strike or the live stream taken down No. Rebroadcasting is indeed piracy.
