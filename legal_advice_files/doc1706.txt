 I typically work from 9am to 9pm, without any overtime or benefits. The boss didn't know sick pay was mandatory till this year(thought it was a benefit). Lets say I have a client at 9am-930am and then my next client is at 10am. He never has, nor do I think he ever would pay someone for a half our they don't work. He also won't pay us if we have multiple of these. Lets say I also have 10-1030 and 11-1130. Is it legal he does not pay us for the 1.5 hours we were not "working" but stuck at the gym for the next person. Could I get some help on what he can and can't be doing legally to his workers in california. I crossposted from r/personalfinance  When you are at work he is required to pay you for your time. I suggest that you look into filing a wage complaint so that he gets the appropriate education on how to treat his employees.
