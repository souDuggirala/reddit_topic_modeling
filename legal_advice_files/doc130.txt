 My parents had a house built for them with Habitat for Humanity when I was a teen. They are done making payments, but can’t own the house. My dad told me that the couple that would have had to sign over the house to him are both dead. So the house is in a weird purgatory where my parents can’t sell it, but they can live there without getting kicked out so long as they keep paying the taxes. My dad said he can’t afford a lawyer to fix the issue because he is on a fixed income now. Is he right, or is there Something else we can do? If what you say is accurate then it would depend on the owner’s will when they died. The house might belong to the estate and your parents just haven’t been discovered yet. Fixing sooner rather than later could prevent a lawsuit if it does in fact belong to the estate and they want the house back. It would also depend on the contract your parents have for the house whether there is a will or not.
