 okay so my best friend told me her dad raped her, so my other friend and I called the police, and we tried contacting her mom and her mom told us that it was just something we made up. So i have a few questions, 1) we are all minors, are we allowed to go to the hospital to get a rape kit done without the hospital contacting her parents about it? and 2) are minors allowed to sue him? or would we need my parents to do it? I'm so fucking angry at her dad and I really wanna help her.  She needs to go to the police.
