 Title. The service provides about 20 fonts and I am not sure if I would be able to host a site powered by them without achieving a licence myself. I’m in the UK, if that’s important. (Not a lawyer, have a website hosted with GoDaddy, have not used their site builder) You're paying to use their site builder, yes? Why wouldn't you be allowed to use the fonts in the site builder that you're paying for?
