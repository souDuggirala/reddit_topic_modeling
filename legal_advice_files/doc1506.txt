 My father passed away 3 months ago in CA. I was not fully sure of what was going on with his assets, but I knew there was no will and very little money. His m debts may have even exceeded what he had. However I was not dealing with this side, his wife was. I got a call today from his bank in Arizona as he lived there for a few years that I was the sole beneficiary on the account. I just have to send in a signature with address. I know that I as an individual will not have to take on his debts, but I wonder if this has any other ramifications. If there are any other debts we did not know about, will I have to do anything else? Or am I free and clear to take that check with nothing else to worry about?  You can always request his wife to look into his credit report to see whatâ€™s going on, each and every single credit line. And also ask the bank if they can give you statements before signing any documents. (Just in case)
