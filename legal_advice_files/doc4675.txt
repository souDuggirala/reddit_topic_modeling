 What clause can I legally add to a secured loan agreement to prevent the transfer of this loan from one party to another? i.e. the secured party cannot sell this debt and it cannot be inherited by a spouse upon death. Thanks. Quebec law, including contract law, is VERY different than in the rest of Canada or the US. Its doubtful you will get useful answers here. I'm not sure that what you want can even be done, but your best bet is to have a professional draw up that contract. Go see a notary or lawyer. Gotcha, that make sense. Thanks for clearing that up.  The security agreement is between myself and a family member, mostly to protect my own property in the instance of a divorce. I don't want the debt to be transferable to anyone else besides this trusted person, in the event of their death. Just curious, why does that matter? If it gets paid it gets paid.
