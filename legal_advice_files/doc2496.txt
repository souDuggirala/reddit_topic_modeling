 My friends and I were in a parking lot rolling a joint and the cops rolled up. They searched us and chained us up for 5 hours in a cell. They took less than half a gram of wax (in a dab pen), a fake ID, and some weed. On the ticket they gave me it just said possession of a forged instrument in the third degree. What are the penalties for this (and the other charges) and how much could it potentially cost me? Yeah I know. I honestly had no idea about all of this. I’m not carrying a fake anymore  Just pointing out that they take this semi seriously in NY, and it could have been worse.  We were in a parking lot. We weren’t using the IDs. They were just in our wallets  It is charged as a felony in NY pretty often. If you are using it to get into a bar, you are using it to "deceive another".  They can also lie to you. This doesn't strike me as a situation where they need to strengthen their case by getting info out of you, but the odds of them improving your situation are insanely lower than the odds of you saying something you'll regret. Get a lawyer. Do not talk to the cops without one. you are already being charged with it, there's no changing that. No, that’s handled by the district attorney.  But can they explain to me what I’m being charged with. They gave us no information  Because they’re the other side of this issue. They can’t help you.  Why Don't talk to the cops. Who can I go to or contact for more information. Can I go back to the station? Fake ID is a big fucking deal kid.  How do I even go about getting an attorney. I’ve never done this before  Also, just because that's what's on the citation doesn't mean the DA can't decide to charge you with more (or different) crimes. Get an attorney. For a fake ID. Seriously? Everyone has a fake id Class "A" misdemeanors are crimes in NYS punishable by up to 1 year in jail. They are on your record for life, unless expunged by court order; or if the case was sealed. You want an attorney to defend against the charge.
