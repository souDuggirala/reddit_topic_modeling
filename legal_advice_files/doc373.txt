 Do I need consent from a government employee to record audio. I myself am a government employee and the subject I am looking to record is a supervisor. He has a history of hearing issues but then denying we ever came to him about it to his supervisors. Because it's not in email or writing it's not official. I want to start with conversation, and end with an email. This way anything in the email is held up by the recording Thanks in advance! Oh and it's in Orange County, Florida USA  Even if Florida is a two party consent state you could just ask for permission to record the conversation (make sure you do so on the recording), In this regard it is absolutely best to do these communication things by email, it's written and your supervisor can't just brush this off as hearing issues. Which are an obvious disability, but this is one way in which you or your coworkers are accommodating said disability.  When you have a conversation with him follow up with an email stating how you understood the conversation to go. That way your side of the conversation, or how you understood it, will be in writing and if he doesnâ€™t agree he can respond. In Florida, all parties must be aware they are being recorded.  Florida is a two-party-consent consent state, meaning it is illegal to record a conversion unless all parties consent.
