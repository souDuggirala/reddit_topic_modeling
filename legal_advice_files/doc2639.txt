 I was thinking about the concept of kickbacks in the medical industry and considering whether the might apply to education and public schooling as well. For clarity I have included the definition of a kickback below: "The federal anti-kickback statute[\[13\]]() prohibits the knowing and willful offer or receipt of remuneration[\[14\]]() to induce the referral of business or services covered by a federal health care program, including Medicare. Even in the presence of other legitimate purposes, the courts have interpreted the statute to cover any arrangement where one purpose of the payment or offer of payment (albeit not the only purpose) was to obtain money for the referral of services or to induce further referrals.[\[1]() " My question is in regards to education in the following way. Say there is a local tutoring company, but in order to get clients goes to a local public school and asks the school to send all students who need tutoring to this company on the condition that the school will receive some percentage of the company revenues in the form of a donation. Can this be considered a kickback or can it be construed as something else like a conditional gift?
