 My friend is out of town and I noticed his car isn’t where he left it. He’s called multiple towing companies and cannot find out if his car was towed. He also cannot file a report for a stolen car over the phone. Can I go to where his car was parked and file a stolen car report if I put him on the phone and he gave the officer all of the information for his car?  Most likely this will be the case. Ok thank you  If they won't take one over the phone, that's correct. So he cannot file a report until he gets back in town?  It is highly unlikely the police will take a stolen car report from someone other than the registered owner.
