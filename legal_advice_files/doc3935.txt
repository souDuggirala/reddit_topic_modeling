 All of this takes place in West Virginia. I attended a college for several years before deciding to leave it for a new school. They wouldn’t allow me to get my transcripts due to a couple thousand dollars I owed (single dorm room). When I finally paid off the debt using their online service, they said they didn’t receive my payment. I then sent them my bank statement and recepits. Now they say that they have received my payment, but they can’t figure out how to clear my account so I’m still on a hold and can’t have my transcripts. I email them every week for an update and they say that they are “working on fixing my account”. Should I be concerned that I am being illegally wronged or is this simply a matter of annoyance? Thank you.  I'd see if your former university has an ombudsmen's office- they exist to serve as a bridge between students and internal departments for a variety of issues students may encounter. They maybe able to help navigate the interworkings on the uni and find the right person/department to resolve your issue.
