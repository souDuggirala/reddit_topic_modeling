I am a high school student and I was enrolled in a dual enrollment program at a local state school. I withdrew from a course but was not aware that I would have to still pay for it if I didn’t take it. I’ve called the school and they will not give me a break on the bill at all. The communication between the university and dual enrollment students was terrible so I had no clue about the withdrawal date. 

I recently received a letter from the attorney general saying that I must pay this debt ($320) in 15 days. I don’t think it’s fair that I have to pay for this when it is at the fault of poor communication on the university’s half and I didn’t receive any credit for the course. What will happen if I don’t pay this?
Also I am a minor and live in PA, just Incase that is relevant to this.
