 So my friend who’s 14 and a freshmen in high school was at a party about 2 weeks ago. He ended up stealing about 3.5k dollars from a bedroom and got a way. Recently at school he was busted for something drug related I’m pretty sure. They found 200 dollars in his bag and two phones so they automatically assumed he was a drug dealer. His parents looked through his phone and found out about him stealing the money. They ended up returning it because he hadn’t spent any yet but the dude he stole from pressed charges. He has court next Wednesday and is going to JDC for the weekend. What kind of trouble is he facing? We are located in New Jersey if that helps. He could be facing time in juvenile for this, 200-500 dollars is up to 18 months in prison, having guilt in two different cases of stealing cash that amounts to over 3.5k and on top of that the supposed drug related issue your friend got busted for its pretty much clear to say that this is going to affect him for the rest of his life
