I work in Ventura County, California, for a franchised restaurant. I have worked at this franchise for over two years, and typically work five six-hour shifts a week.

The store does not make a lot of money, so the staff is usually kept as lean as possible. This means there are typically only one or two people working at any given time. Many shifts are worked entirely alone. Because of the short staffing, it is generally impossible for the staff to take an uninterrupted 10 minute break or half hour lunch break. When working alone, it is impossible, because we are not allowed to close the store during open hours for our breaks. In my over two years of working for this establishment I have taken less than ten lunch breaks, and that is more than most of the staff.

It is my understanding that in California you are entitled to compensation for each missed break, equaling an hour of pay for every half hour break missed within a three year period. For me alone this would total to several thousand dollars, and significantly more for the rest of the staff in the past three years.

If I were interested in pursuing this money would I be better off contacting the California labor board, or should I look into hiring a lawyer willing to do a class action lawsuit on behalf of the employees of my store? I have been informed that it may be difficult to find a lawyer willing to represent the employees of such a small franchise, is that an accurate assessment?
