I asked a question in here a couple days ago and it was recommended to make a plea to the judge (thx, guy!) My man is being indicted (honestly don't even understand what that means, is what it says online, receiving stolen property f4) on the 6th. He doesn't even have a lawyer yet. I want to express to the judge my man needs mental help and rehab and if he could come on probation instead of returning to prison I'll do whatever it takes to support and help my man turn his life around, and he is at his breaking point so is willing to as well.  Im a terrible writer and I have no clue how to do this or where to start. Thanks so much! Ooh ok im just trying to figure things out, tsm! He applied for one of those free lawyers but hasnt been appointed one yet.    Whoever suggested that doesn’t really understand how the court system works. You cannot just send things to the judge, indeed doing so is normally a violation of the rules of the court. What you need to do is get him an attorney and have the attorney deal with it. There may come a time where character references or similar statements about the needs of the defendant would be heard by the court, but that is a long way down the road, its not now before he has even appeared before a judge. Equally important, a lay person’s opinion isn’t going to carry a lot of weight with the court. If he really needs help of some kind its likely that a mental health professional is going to need to provide an expert opinion. But again this is all strategy that he should be discussing with his attorney (and NOT you unless his attorney say its OK, because you could void his privilege and be required to testify).  You and he need to do what his attorney tells you to do. Felony charges are not DIY territory.
