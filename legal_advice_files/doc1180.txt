 I apologise if this is not the right place to ask this question but I figured it might be a safe place to start. Today when I went to the mail I had two W-2s in my mailbox. One is mine and the other belongs to someone I have never met or heard of. It does not look to be a fake document. The address is identical to mine but the person is a male (I am female) and their employer is out of Oklahoma. My questions are: is it illegal to use someone else's address on your tax return and, if so, who would I report it to? Could this be an indicator that my identity or personal information has been tampered with? Should I contact the company listed on the W-2? I don't know what my next move should be, if any. This happened in CT with many people one year. We got part of another persons W2 and it created a major fiasco. I even got a call from a lady who got mine. I just sent the one mailed to me back to the sender. It does happen. It is not likely someone tampered with your identity since the W2 had someone else's name on it. Someone may have used your address. Or the company may have made a mistake. I would either call the company or send a letter explaining the problem. If you send a letter, include the W2.  Just give it back to the USPS  -2? Yes. They need to know that the W2s they sent weren't received. I don't see the identity theft angle, personally. If anything, the employee whose W2 was misdirected is at risk of identity theft _by you_. We moved here two years ago and I know the previous owners well. They lived here for 10 years before us. It is not one of their names. Have you recently(in the last year or so) moved to this address? When I bought my first house I received two W-2’s and a 1099 for the couple that I bought the home from. They hadn’t told their employers about their address change. I don’t see how it would be some kind of scam if it doesn’t have your name or info other than address on it.
