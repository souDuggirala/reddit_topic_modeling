 Hello, I have I simple question that I’m just wondering about. If (theoretically) I’m 16, have a probationary license, and live in Indiana, what is the penalty for getting caught driving with passengers? In this theoretical situation, I’m driving within the legal hours, but there is no adult with a valid license in the car. What would be the penalty if I got caught by a police officer driving around 1 or more friends? Thanks for the help! I've always been frustrated that so many driver's guides or driver's ed books don't make this explicit. The Indiana BMV's "Driver Guide for Parents and Teens" just says: In most cases, there's another violation that you are pulled over for, so the citation for that gets reported to the BMV and they know that you violated your probationary license terms. Indiana Motor Vehicle Code [Section 9-30-5-6]() says that a violation of your probationary license terms is a Class C infraction and can result in a license suspension of up to one year. That's at the traffic court judge's discretion. Class C infractions have a variable range of fines in Indiana. While probationary license violations are themselves eligible for deferred adjudication, having a probationary license means that other violations that are not specifically violations of the license restrictions are not eligible for deferred adjudication. My recollection of a typical penalty from when I was an Indiana teenager a thousand years ago is that you get a license suspension of 30 days and a six-month delay in getting your license. But that was in the Paleolithic era when dinosaurs roamed the banks of the St. Joe. If Indiana is like other states, you're probationary period will start over again. It may increase your insurance rates also.
