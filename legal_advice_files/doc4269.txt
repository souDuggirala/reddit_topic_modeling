 For example, in the case where someone was taken advantage of and coerced into unwanted and illicit acts while excessively inebriated; if that person were to give an account to the police and then make the decision to not press charges, would that reflect badly or bring other potential repercussions on them in the event of future litigation, either by the victim or perceived offender? Or in any event really, could not pressing charges adversely affect someone?  You don't decide whether charges are pressed or not. You may decide not to participate in the investigation or support the prosecution of an offense. That decision is legal, yours to make, and has no direct legal consequence on you. It is certainly possible that an officer investigating an event may wonder why you didn't participate in the prosecution of an offense and looking into that circumstance. Which in some cases may lead to the discovery of offenses you committed.
