I travelled with my son to London a couple months ago from Oslo for a weekend. Our return flight from London was delayed by 2 hours and 14 minutes. It was supposed to land back in Oslo by 2310. Leaving us 1 hour and 40 minutes to still make the last train from the airport to where we live on the West side of Oslo (I hold a monthly train pass and my son would travel for free on weekends). We obviously missed this by quite some margin. And taxis being obscenely expensive that they are here ended up costing me NOK2500 (USD300) for a 45 minute drive. 

Their rules are that if a flight is delayed for avoidable reasons by more than 2 hours you have a right to a claim. The reason the flight was delayed was because by the time the flight had touched down at Gatwick the crew on board had already exceeded their max working hours for the day (they had been working over 12 hours). It took Norwegian over 2 hours to arrange for a new crew to arrive at the airport. Infuriatingly they claim that this was an unavoidable circumstance which couldn't have been avoided even if all reasonable measure had been taken. Here is their reply:

This is frankly ridiculous. It is absolutely foreseeable and avoidable had they had their systems in order. The flight took over 2 hours to arrive from Oslo to Gatwick. It was clear the moment the plane departed that this crew would not be able to work further that night. They had 2 full hours to arrange a new crew. Yet it somehow slipped through and they try to claim it was an unforeseeable circumstance which is impossible for me to accept. 

I am sure they just bank on people not escalating these matters further as not being worth their time and effort. But frankly I'm willing to spend money on this issue just out of principal. 

What can I do about this? 

Thanks.  can you not claim off your travel insurance? Thanks for your quick reply. I have been unable to find a list of what constitutes a reasonable or unavoidable delay. Hence the post here. I agree about not spending thousands to recoup usd300.  You'll have to check their Carrier/Carriage agreement about what sort of thing would constitute a reasonable or avoidable or unavoidable delay.  Beyond that, it's likely that you bound yourself to arbitration by purchasing the ticket, but you'd have to check the specifics of your agreement for that too.

Start there and see what you find before you go spending potentially thousands on legal fees to recoup $300 USD.
