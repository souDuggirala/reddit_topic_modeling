  My brother has been in jail in Tijuana for several weeks. We have not heard from him or seen him. The attorney (who is reputable) has told us not to visit, but is now saying we should go down to this court near the border for a hearing. He is accused of possessing drugs with the intent to sell. It was a larger amount and I’m concerned that if he is guilty, someone will be looking for the drugs or money and I don’t want my family to be in any danger. Clear legal question for mods: Can someone tell me what this hearing is for and if we should make the trip down there to attend this hearing? Our family does not live in California. Edit for location bot: brother used to love in San Diego. He moved to Rosarito because it was cheaper and still close enough to the VA.   Your brothers' attorney can tell you what the hearing is for. They've also already advised that you should be attending this hearing. No one here will know what it's for exactly.
