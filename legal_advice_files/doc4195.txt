 Is this something that I can press charges over? I looked and couldn't find any notices they were going to enter our apartment for me to prepare and crate him for. Does that matter? Is there a law about this? Could we at least get the right to move out of here early? It may not be "random." They may have had reasons; potentially reasons congruent with the law. Ask them about it. In North Carolina it is recommended that the landlord provide 24 hours notice but not required. If you haven't already, share your dogs photo on your personal social media, any local dog groups and put up signs. I hope you find them! I would also have a talk with your landlord as it is common practice to give notice even if it is not required. They should have known better than to enter the apartment unannounced when there is a dog on the property.  One instance of management entering without notice generally does not rise to the level of breach of lease, and as such, you probably can't terminate your lease over this; having said that, North Carolina doesn't require your landlord to give you any kind of notice for entry, so long as that entry is for a handful of reasons (repair, inspection, etc.)... so it's going to come down to what the lease says concerning the landlord's right to enter the premises and why the entered. Is it in your lease that they can enter without notice, or perhaps you just didn't see it? In any case, I would contact local shelters/pounds and describe what happened, and leave your phone number and dog description. Is the dog micro chipped? If not, get that done, assuming you hopefully find it. Why did they enter your apartment? You can't press charges in any case, no.
