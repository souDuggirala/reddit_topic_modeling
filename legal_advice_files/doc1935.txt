 He passed away a couple of years ago. I’m also an heir. Because of the new Generous tax laws, my Grandma was able to gift away a ton of farmland to the heirs from an LLC. I, along with other 25 or so heirs, was gifted farmland appraised at around $150,000. The trustee told me even though I now “own” the farmland, I can’t sell or mortgage it. I just get income from it. But the trustee said all the income goes to my Grandma and is given away at her discretion. That doesn’t make sense. As a beneficiary of the trust I’m not sure what I’m entitled to. I requested a copy of the trust agreement from the trustee. He has to give this to me, correct? There are around 15 other beneficiaries for that one. Because the farmland and stock was gifted away (from my Grandma) to the heirs, they are now safely held in trust and not subject to estate taxes. She, however, could not gift away some mutual funds, that were originally set up to pay estate taxes, but are now available to the heirs as well. Can I cash any of these out? I feel like I’m being withheld information. I would like any money available, now, obviously. All of the other beneficiaries are unconcerned as they don’t need the money and just inherited a lot of money from the will. What do I do? I feel like my family is being very shady (but I’m not trying to remove the trustee) Please help. I don’t know what I don’t know.  When the people above me (children) get 10x as much $$ that they don’t need, I’d rather remove myself entirely. Trickle-down economics doesn’t work.  $3000/yr big whoop? Shoot, I'll take it!
