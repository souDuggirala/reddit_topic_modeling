 My friend recently had to move out quickly after her roommate exploded on her and toed the line of violence. She’s been staying with me until her new apartment is ready but most of her stuff is still at the old house. Her ex roommate is now refusing to let her in to get her things and claiming there’s a “trespass warrant” so she can never get her stuff. She was not served so we doubt that part was true. What can be done to recover her property? This is in Virginia  [removed] I would ask the police on how to proceed with that one, but she has legal right to that residents and they will be more than willing to assist her. It may be that the police arranged to be there when he is there, or they may even possibly forcibly enter their way in, because you authorize it as a tenant there. Worst case scenario you're on the hook for the cost of the lock repair. He does  Who owns the building? He changed the locks He doesn't need to be there to let her in. Unless she's been evicted it's still her legal residence.  That’s what I was thinking but he is saying he won’t be home to let them in/she’ll go to jail (which we don’t believe)  Call your Police non-emergency line and ask for an escort to retrieve your things.
