 I guess I should give a little backstory. I'm an 18-yr old male who used to be abused by my dad. I want to take him to court when I leave home and try to lock him up, because I genuinely fear for my life when I leave, but I don't know how I'll go about this. The only proof I have of his abuse is my own testimony. My brothers have seen him abuse all of us, but his gaslighting has genuinely convinced them that it never happened. There was also a recent physical altercation in the house in which he grabbed my throat and I used excessive force to defend myself, but again, the only proof I have that he grabbed my throat is my own testimony, meanwhile he and my siblings will use their own testimonies of my excessive force as a way to invalidate my case. I have a ten year old brother in the house who has also been strangled and hit, as recent as one year ago, so I'm really at an impasse. Calling CPS and getting custody temporarily taken away is one thing, but I want a permanent solution that will leave him out of my life and out of my little brother's life. I can't just move out of city because I go to college here, and I'm not wanting to leave my brother with that monster. You can report the abuse to the police. They will investigate and determine what charges he may face. Calling CPS and reporting the abuse of your younger brother is really your only option. That is how you start removing him permanently.  CPS can do more than take custody away temporarily You are well within the statute of limitations. Contact the police and/or CPS, those are your options for seeing him imprisoned for his crimes. Look into getting a [restraining order](http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-domesticviolence.htm). At the very least, you will have started a paper trail
