 I am at school in Indiana right now but i’m from New York. I got in some stupid trouble with weed that i know i wouldn’t have gotten in back in NY but weed is treated like heroine here. so anyways i’m trying to transfer to a SUNY school and it asks the question “have u ever been convicted of a felony/misdeamor” and all that on the transcript. i haven’t taken the class or gone through the year long “probation” period but do i still have to say yes i have been convicted?  Nope you haven't been convicted. Only way that will happen is if you fuck up during your diversion period! So don't! yes. think of a fork in the road -- diversion is one path, conviction is the other. so when do say “done”u mean like it says it’s a dismissed charge on my record?  you'll have to ask your attorney to be sure, but most diversion programs are pre-conviction and done in lieu of conviction.
