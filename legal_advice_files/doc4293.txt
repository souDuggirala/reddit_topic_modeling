 Hello Everyone, We have a 1099 and were audited. They took 2 years to audit us and at the end our accountant told us that they throw everything up against the wall and hope that enough sticks to negotiate a settlement with the taxpayer. He told us not to worry because they deny everything you submit and that he would discuss it with them and we would not have to pay anywhere close to the amount they were asking for. They ended up levying us for a large amount of money while he was negotiating for us. He is still speaking with them and supposedly is speaking to a State Representative about getting some money back. We told him that the money was taken from a retirement account and he said that it is very illegal for them to do that. We found the statement showing that it was taken from the retirement account but are unsure how to proceed from here. I don't think I trust him to handle the situation. Any ideas are appreciated.  Was this an IRA? An IRA does not have the same protections as a 401(k). Speak with a tax attorney
