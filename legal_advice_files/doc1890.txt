 I got arrested in South Carolina and ended up doing the pretrial intervention program, honestly I believe it was a waste of time which it was and I believe I have no chance of getting a job whatsoever. What is the whole benefit of doing this program anyway?  Idk where the conviction thing came from since I only was arrested  [removed] Ok, so beyond not having to tell employers that you've got a prior conviction (some convictions actually being disqualifying for certain jobs), if you're ever arrested and charged again, should you be convicted, your prior criminal history is taken into account at sentencing. So if you have a prior conviction, you'll generally get a higher sentence than if you didn't. not really to tell you the truth you don't see the benefit in not having to tell potential employers that you were arrested ? Yea ok and I was told my arrest would be expunged, but I still see no benefit to that. With most of these programs if you successfully complete it, you won't end up getting a conviction on your record.
