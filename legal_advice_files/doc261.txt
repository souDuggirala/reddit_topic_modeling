 So as the title says my wife got fired. Her employer claims she’s been trending downward for 6 months and after multiple discussions and attempts to right the ship she hasn’t been able to. First off, she came back from maternity leave 6 months ago. It’s understandable she hasn’t been trending well because of the psychological impact of not having the baby around constantly like she desires as a mother. Secondly, a few weeks back she was in a fairly severe wreck which gave her a serious concussion which she still suffers from. She came back to work two days after the accident. Thirdly, she spends her lunch hour at the daycare less than a mile from the office so she can feed the baby, but is mostly back in time to not take a long lunch. Fourthly, her branch manager is wrong about what he says regarding extra training. He’s approached her once and basically gave her a pep talk rather than actual training, and this has happened once since she got back from maternity leave, so no actual effort was given to help get her back on track. Lastly, her manager has a history of this type of, and also sexist, behavior. We have on record that he has been very sexist to my wife, to where Corporate HR has had to been contacted and they have had to speak with him about it. Is there any hope for her keeping the job under these circumstances? Help ...which would be a waste of time and money since her firing was 100% legal. That’s what I feared. Thanks.   If she's supposed to meet certain metrics and isn't, this is irrelevant. She would need to prove that her firing was due to a protected reason.  Your next step should be to speak to an employment lawyer in your jurisdiction if you believe she was discriminated against due to being a protected class. However, I don't know that anything you have listed would be considered discrimination. You can't be fired for getting pregnant but you can absolutely be fired because your work performance declined.
