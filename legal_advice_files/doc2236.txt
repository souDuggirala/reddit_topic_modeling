 Father in law passed 2 weeks ago. He had his savings at the same credit union that holds his mortgage. His bank account with his savings was frozen by the bank to make sure their mortgage was going to be covered. Now all the automatic deductions , including the mortgage, are not going thru.. Is this legal?? We're in Oregon She did about a week ago. She's planning to visit them again tomorrow to straighten it all out. Has she gone into a branch with appropriate documentation of her status as executor? Thanks! Odd thing here (and I could have explained better) is that my wife was put on her dads accounts once he became ill and they are still frozen. She is the executor and now can't access the account. If a sole account holder dies, it is normal for their accounts to be frozen until an estate can be established. There’s no living person currently owning the account, and they can’t just assume that pre-existing bills should be paid.
