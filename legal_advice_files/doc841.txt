 I am in Florida. I saw a doctor a few months ago 3 or 4 times, and I did not go through insurance because he gave me a really good cash rate. Since I paid cash, I don't remember the dates of services and need them plus any medical records for my files. I texted the doctor (he doesn't have a secretary and just uses his mobile phone for the office and has texted before to arrange appointments) asking for this info and how to get it and how much it would cost. He responded with "why do you want it?". I then responded with "for my personal records". He then said "what's this really about?" and proceeded to call me five times in one hour. I was unable to answer the phone at that time and texted back that I couldn't speak on the phone at the moment, that I had already texted the reason but it seems he is scared that I'm trying to make a claim and I gave no intention of doing so, that I'm entitled to if legally and don't have to give any reason for wanting it, nor do I have to prove why I want it and be approved by him. He then proceeded to call me five more times, and by that point, I was so uncomfortable, I didn't answer. I tried texting today asking when he'll be in the office so I can pick it up then, how much it will cost but he didn't answer except to call me a few more times; but by this point, I'm getting uncomfortable because he is refusing to put anything in writing, answer my appropriate questions on how I can obtain them which is my right, and is suspicious of my reasons for wanting them even when I gave my reason which I didn't even have to. So, any advice on what my rights are and how to proceed from here?  Thanks for your advice  None of this sounds normal for a legitimate practice. Contact your stateâ€™s medical board to file a complaint and you may actually get somewhere. Honestly the Guy sounds shady enough that the records may not even exist.
