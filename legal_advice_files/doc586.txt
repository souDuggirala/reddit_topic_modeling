 I was ticketed for driving a van on the clock without a class E license. I was unaware I needed anything other than the class F ive had since I was initially hired on. My work should not have let me on the road without this, and I asked my coworkers and managers about a special license upon interview, but they said I did not need one. I had been stopped 3 other times in MO and none of those officers said anything about my class F license. I have been driving with the company for 2 years and they have had my license on file, and even renewed my license and sent an updated copy to HR, with no request to get a class E. My office is on the KS side of KC, but I live in MO. The officer said the base license in KS is equivalent to a Class E, but since I live in MO I have the basic non commercial class F. Is it my fault I was on the road for 2 years, unaware I was driving without the correct license? Or is it the fault of the company? It's your fault. the company should have checked too.
