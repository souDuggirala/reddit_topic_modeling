 So today I was on my way to the mall where I work, but on my way I was delayed for 2hours because the escalator upstairs had broken!!!!! I was halfway up and it just broke!!!! I was stranded there for a whole 2 hours and I got fired!!!!! Can I sew the mall for this? I hope her parents check the browsing history so they can see how weird their kid is.  I remember when I was 10 or 11, sending wacko messages in AOL chat rooms was the fun way to annoy people on the internet. In the 0% chance this is a real post, sure! Sue away! You can sue anyone for any reason. The important part is whether you're wasting your time and money, which you obviously would be doing. This is a troll Why do you want me to sew your pants, I'm not a lawyer  On the minuscule chance this isn't a troll, and they're too dumb to walk up a stopped escalator, they deserve to be fired What does clothes have to do with anything?? Nice troll  I have a pair of pants that need mending. You're more than welcome to sew them for me.  Escalator, I was stuck for a whole 2 hours Sew means to mend or make clothing. You mean sue, and no.  Escalator or elevator? Because an escalator you can just walk down
