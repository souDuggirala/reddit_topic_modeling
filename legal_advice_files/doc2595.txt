 When I was 15 I tore my ACL, MCL, and my Meniscus playing football. This happened in July and then in September I went for surgery. Through the first few weeks after surgery I was in so much pain that it would physically make me sick. SO much so that i went back to the hospital that night for how much pain i was in. I didn't think much of it at the time because it was the first major surgery i had ever had. Before to long I was in Physical Therapy, doing a intense program so that i could return to football allowing me to get back on track to where i was. I returned to full contact in late May of the following year. Through that whole time (Therapy, and that summer of football practice) my knee never felt good. I was still in pain and it always just felt weird. Then barley even a year later after tearing my ACL the first time, at the beginning of august of that year i had to quit playing because of how much pain my knee was in. In December i had found out that i had torn my ACL, and Meniscus. So I then went to the same doctor that did my first surgery and had surgery in April. Went back through therapy and that whole process and didn't end up returning to football. I always had a feeling that the doctor that performed my surgery didn't do it correctly or messed up the first time. Now i sit here as a 19 year man and I've seen that doctor more then i ever wanted to. He made national news for getting caught under the influence while operating on a patient and had performed two other surgery's before one of the nurses in the operating room reported him. My Family and friends both say that i don't have a case on anything i have. But before i gave up completely i just thought that I'd post on here and see if anyone had any input on my story. Do I have a case to where i could sue him? Or would i just be wasting my time?
