  He's lived there since 1987. He's won his cancer fight. Yet last month new owners took a poll asking who smoked in the complex and now they sent a letter stating a smoking ban will be in effect. Banning smoking from all the old peoples residences, the parking lot (including in his vehicle) and within 25feet of the property grounds. He has to sign something Tuesday. Is this legal? Can they evict my dad for smoking? He's not scared of cancer, he's not hurting anyone, he wishes he was dead and he just wants to be left in peace for the rest of his short days.
