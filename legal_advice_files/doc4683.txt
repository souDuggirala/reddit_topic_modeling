 "Bandit" signs are signs that were put up without requesting permission. Anything by the side of a freeway, for example. I've seen a lot of political signs on power line right-of-ways recently, or on HoA common areas that explicitly ban signs. Is it legal to just pick them up and throw them away? I am in Georgia but I'm guessing the laws are similar everywhere. If they are on a public utility pole or public right of way it is considered abandoned property and can be disposed of like any other litter. Generally political signs can be disposed of after an election but usually not before.   I'll repeat: 're posted on, you have no right to remove them. Understandable for right-of-ways. What about public property like freeway on/offramps? It is illegal to remove a political poster from private property. It is illegal to place a political poster on public property (and on private property that is not yours without permission). I don't know what legal nuances might exist to the specific question you are asking, and so, if it were me, I wouldn't remove those signs. My gut feeling, however, is that it would not be illegal to do so. (Not a lawyer, so take this with a grain of salt)
