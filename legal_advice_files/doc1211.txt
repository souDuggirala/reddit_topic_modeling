 Hey guys, this is a throwaway account- and i am not sure if the flair is correct. Please advise. Cliff notes: I have been on short term disability. I went to the docs office to get medically cleared to return to work. The documents were to be sent from the docs office, but they were not. I was planning to return to work today, but due to the delay I did not. The docs office cannot confirm that the fax was sent (IE the fax receipt). Q: 1. Can a company be held liable for their inaction regarding lost wages if it can be proven? 2. Is it worth the effort? 3. How would I, as an individual, act to request compensation? As always, thank you for your assistance.  Thank you  : 1. Can a company be held liable for their inaction regarding lost wages if it can be proven? Unlikely here. I can't see how the doc owes you no duty to send documents. Thank you The doctor's office is not liable here.
