Hello legaladvice,

Our apartment has laundry rooms, maintained and operated by a laundry service. Washer and driers are all $1.75 each per use. But when I check my credit card bill, I see $8. Even when I use the washer twice and the drier once, I get billed $8 instead of $5.25. Sometimes when I call and complain, they send a cheque for the remaining money, but I don't know how many people in the apartment call and complain. This looks like daylight robbery. It looks like like they fix it when they get caught. How do I make them pay for their deeds ? I'm in CA.
