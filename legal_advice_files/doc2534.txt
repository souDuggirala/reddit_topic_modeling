 Hello! I just started a new part time position working as a pet sitter for someone who owns a petsitting business. They employ a few other petsitters and hook us up as basically independent contractors with the benefit of marketing, scheduling, and all that nice stuff under their company name. One of the benefits of working for them is that have pet sitting insurance - if a freak accident occurs and a pet dies on our watch, we're safe from getting sued (provided we followed policy). I just set up my first sitting appointment and I'm pretty excited, but my employer is asking me to pay around $100 for insurance coverage. Is this legal to ask me to do?  Yes it would if you're 1099 you would be considered an independent contractor. you would reasonably be expected to pay for the aforementioned insurance. Opposed to if you are a W-2 employee your employer would have to pay for the insurance.  I'm not sure. I will have to ask. Does it make a large difference? I'm sorry if that's a dumb question. I'm a college student who has only had W-2 positions before.  Ah, thank you!! I appreciate the answer. Its good to put a label to this and to know that what I'm getting into is legal and normal.  Just to clarify are you a W-2 employee or 1099 independent contractor? It doesn't sound like you're working for a small business, or that you have a new boss. It sounds like you're an independent contractor working through an aggregation type business that provides It is, of course, possible that your status as an independent contractor could be unsound, or there could be other problems in this relationship. But in the broadest terms this arrangement is legal and reasonably common.
