 Hey guys! Okay so here we go, a few months back my boyfriend moved in with me, so he sublet his appartement to this guy he knows. I met him he was very nice and polite. But the problem is, my boyfriend and the man did not sign any contract of this rent. The man renting his appartement stoped paying the rent two months ago. He has become very hard to reach, almost impossible. Says he will pay, then doesnâ€™t. Today my boyfriend went by to get a letter of his. He got into the appartement and everything was gone, broken, garbage everywhere, ash, etc. All his belongings are gone. I wanted to know if there was something we could do. There are rumours that the man has been on crack and doing illegal stuff. My boyfriend is in crippled dept, he is so anxious and so am i. Please tell us there is something we can do, he is going to file a police report. But i feel like it is not enough, and he should be able to get his belongings back at least. Or a compensation? Thank you for taking the time to read.  Also give him notice of termination of the sublet and then you can get an eviction order from the LTB. 1. Yes, file a police report. 2. File a claim with his renters insurance.
