 Hi all. I am becoming a teacher and I need to submit to a background check. One of the questions is: "Have I ever had a criminal RECORD expunged". I have 2 possession charges that date were minor and date back aprox. 20 years. I was never arrested, or held in detainment. I did have to appear in front of a judge and both charges were expunged. Since I was not arrested or found guilty is this considered a criminal record? Do I say yes or no? Thank you for your assistance.   If you have never had a criminal record, then I believe you have never had it expunged. You may wish to consult with a criminal lawyer to be sure thought.  It was so long ago I honestly do not recall. I do remember not saying a word in the court room as my lawyer did all the talking. If a plea was made I would have to guess it was No Contest. Were the charges “expunged”, were they “dropped”, were you “found not guilty”, or did you plead “no contest”? I suspect that charges can’t be expunged, but convictions can. So if you were never convicted, then you can’t have it expunged - or so I suspect but am not certain about.
