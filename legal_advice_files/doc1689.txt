 Thanks in advance. Screen is not physically damaged but does not work properly out-of-box. I had to open the box to find this out, and the website's return policy is as follows:  It's Hawaii time. I got the package today at Noon Hawaii time. I called them saying I was having issues with the graphics. By about 3PM Hawaii time, I realized I was SOL and had to return it. Unfortunately in West Coast time, they were closed. So I have to wait to call them tomorrow. I'm trying to understand this BEFORE calling them lol What did they say when you contacted them or the manufacturer?
