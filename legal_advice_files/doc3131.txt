 Just moved into the end unit of a triplex in November. About 2 weeks ago my boyfriend noticed that my toddlers bedrooms floor under her bed was wet. I took a look at it to see if she had pee'd but she didn't. It's been raining here a lot and I didn't notice any visible signs of leakage from the walls or ceilings. My assumption is that there's possibly a crack in the foundation but I'm not an expert. I informed the property manager the next day about the leaking and even sent him a video of it. That was about 2 weeks ago and it's happened again since. I know a little bit about tenant-landlord rights due to previous bad roommates but I'm not entirely sure what to do in this situation. This is in Fl. That's the right way to go about it. Make sure you document every email/text/call/correspondence, any notices you send them, and follow the rent withholding procedure to the letter. Yeah that sounds gross. I'm not sure about florida laws. When I had an issue with a landlord in NJ, my lawyer advised me that i had to give a "reasonable amount of time to repair" or something along those lines. Not sure how it works in Florida unfortunately  I think you would have to give the landlord some kind of time frame to repair before being able to break the lease. Is there anything in your lease regarding repairs to the building? You should be able to. If they dont get it fix mold will form and turn into a dangerous health hazard. They are required to fix any problems that show up in their buildings  Please review the [Landlord Tenant Questions]() section of the /r/LegalAdvice Wiki for common questions and answers regarding landlord tenant issues.
