 Hi! I'm a graphics designer, 9/10 I work with Twitch streamers and I'm looking into opening a Partner program, they'll be provided with a discount code for new customers, discounts and perks such as a free emote for them everytime someone provides their code, now I have many doubts on how to do this, I'm thinking of a contract so they don't drop or remove the ad, although I'm not fully aware what the procedure would be. Thanks in advance"
