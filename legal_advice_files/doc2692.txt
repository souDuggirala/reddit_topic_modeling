 If I create a website for sole purpose of allowing other students to post their feedback about the college. I personally won't post my story on there since I will be running the website. If the university finds out that it is me who has created it, what can they legally do to stop me? Thanks bunch! No logos or anything will be copied . I will review the student conduct book to see what it entails   Not much, but if you're violating the student code of conduct or some such thing in running this website, then the university can take whatever actions they take when a violation of the code of conduct happens.
