 Hey r/legaladvice, I have been dating an illegal immigrant for the past three years, she came to the US legally using a travel Visa but never left. I am wanting to marry her and I understand that there is a good chance even though we marry she can be barred from the US for 3 to 10 years. What am I looking at here, what are my chances of successfully being able to live the rest of my life with her? I am wanting to talk to a immigrant lawyer soon and find out our exact options, but this does have me worried. Columbia  You can marry her for sure. You need to consult with an immigration lawyer to help determine if she will be able to live in the US. What country is she from? Perhaps you could live there while you get this sorted out. You need an immigration attorney, full stop. These laws are so complex that thatâ€™s pretty much your only option.
