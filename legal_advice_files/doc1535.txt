 I used my grandmas credit card to buy Vbucks on my Xbox and I don’t know if I can get in trouble. This is in GA btw, asking for a freind.  Then this is most certainly credit card fraud. My freind said yes  IANAL. Credit card fraud.  Yes If she didn’t know and catches it, yes. It doesn’t matter what state you’re in, theft is theft.
