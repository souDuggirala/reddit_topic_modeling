 I am currently working on branding a product and this specific product has the name of a character to a very popular TV show in it. The product would be called "The (Character Name Here)" or some other name following "Inspired by (Character Name Here)". I should also mention I live in the USA. Would either of those ideas be considered infringing on a copyright or trademark? The advice is. Don't. This is infringement. You have to get permission to use the name.  Yes, you are almost certainly infringing on a trademark.
