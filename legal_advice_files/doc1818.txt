 Back in December my gf and I were asked to renew our lease. The office sent us a list of durations and the prices; ours had gone up $100/month. We agreed to renew our lease for the 12 month term. This week we received our lease to sign, reviewed it and realized the rent was the same. We thought the office was not charging us a rent increase for some reason and signed. The office signed it and sent it back to us. Hours later we received a notice saying there was a computer error and our lease needed to be resigned at the updated rate. Since the lease agreement has all signatures, we thought that is a valid lease agreement. The office says the lease is invalid. Who’s right? Don’t create an issue where none exists. Sign the new lease. You have to live there for 12 more months, why do you really want to piss off your landlords? So what if they made a mistake in the paperwork, I’m sure we all make plenty of our own without intending to. Just sign the new lease at the corrected rate.  Thank you for the clarification. You can look up Indiana's contract laws and court cases regarding unilateral/mutual mistakes. You don't get to come out ahead because a clerical mistake was made in a contract when you signed it knowing the wrong amount was listed.  Why? What’s invalid about it? The lease is invalid. You need to sign a new (corrected) one if you want to stay.  They did not specify, just called it an “unfortunate computer error”.  Hm. What type of computer error?
