 Hey guys, so a couple months ago i got a traffic citation for following too closely. I ended up paying the day after my court date was scheduled because i completely forgot about it. For some reason I'm worried they issued a warrant for me that day when i didn't show up to court and haven't paid the ticket yet and even though i paid it the warrant is still out there. Is this a possibility? If it is, how can I check to see if there is indeed a warrant out there?
