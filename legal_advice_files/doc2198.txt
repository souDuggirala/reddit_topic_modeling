 I've never been in trouble with the law. I've worked for this big retail company for years. We get coupons from them to purchase item, electronics, for big discounts. I ran upon a reddit post that claimed If you changed last numbers numbers on these coupons, you could in fact use it a lof of times. I tried it and it worked. I told a couple of coworkers about it as well and so we just used them and purchased more stuff. When I made these purchases, other employees, security, and even some managers knew about it, so I figured it was OK. However, I recently got arrested and my coworker was too, and told it was illigal. I freaked the fuck out. If I've known it was illigal I wouldn't have done it. I have a lawyer now but I want to know what can happen. I'm expecting a baby with my wife and I can't be away from them. If I knew this I. Wouldn't have never done it. Never been arrested or committed any crime in my life. Can I get some input on this please. Thank you.  If youâ€™ve been arrested you should retain an attorney and work with him to determine the best path in handling your charges.  Ignorance of the law is not a defense. Talk to your attorney about the possible punishment.
