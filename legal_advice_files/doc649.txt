  Hey Reddit, My mom’s been having an issue with a fence shared with a neighbor. The neighbors wanted the fence replaced, and did so about a year ago. The fence didn’t really need to be replaced (it was still sound), but my mom agreed to pay 20% of the cost if her specified contractor was used, since replacement was unnecessary and my dad had constructed the previous fence (neighbor paid half of materials, labor was free). They wound up replacing the fence NOT using my mom’s contractor. Nothing was heard from them until about two months ago, when they requested 50% of the cost to be reimbursed via letter. By this time, it had been \~9 months since the fence was installed. My thoughts were to not respond, but my mom wants to as she believes it might look bad should it come to small claims court that she did not respond. Opinions on whether to respond or not, and if so, does this sound alright? Should the part about agreeing to pay 20% be excluded? Thanks! TLDR- Neighbor wanted fence replaced, mom never agreed to pay since it didn't need replacing- should she respond to their payment demand letter? Response to payment demand letter follows: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Dear Neighbor, This is in response to (neighbor’s) letter dated January 16, 2019. In particular, I would like to address inaccurate information in that letter. (Property manager) informed me that (neighbor) wanted a new fence to match his other two new fences. I consulted a fence contractor, who informed me that my side of the fence did not need repair or replacement. Due to this expert opinion as well as the fact that my family and I incurred the majority of the cost of the previous fence replacement, I explained to (property manager) that I would agree to pay for 20% of the replacement, only if (fencing company) was used. (Property manager) communicated to me on multiple occasions, via both oral and written methods, that (neighbor) would pay for the cost of fence replacement. In a letter dated January 26, 2018, (Property manager) quotes (neighbor): “…we want to go ahead and replace the fence and we will pay for the cost of the replacement.” At no time did I provide verbal or written agreement of any personal financial contribution towards the cost of the fencing materials or installation. Everything on my side, including the rod iron fence, was structurally sound prior to any work being done. (Fencing contractor’s) workers cut the iron rod bolt on the cement of my property. Fencing contractor apologized for this and subsequently his workers used “cement glue” in effort to re-secure the bolt. I hope this information brings conclusion to this matter. Sincerely, Neighbor Thanks for the info! Thanks for the input. That's a good point. California is very different from most states. California law presumes that both owners benefit equally from the boundary fence, and therefore are equally responsible for the reasonable costs of construction and maintenance. However, this is not an absolute rule and can be rebutted with additional evidence. Adjoining landowners presumed to be equally responsible for reasonable costs of construction, maintenance, or necessary replacement of boundary fences Must give adjoining landowner 30 days' notice before beginning work Must provide description of problem with the fence; proposed solution and estimated costs; proposed timeline for completing project The law does not apply to fences that are completely within the property of one of the two landowners.[1] If a fence is located on the land of only one landowner, the neighbor is not legally responsible for any portion of the fence cost, unless the parties agree otherwise. Looks like the neighbors did not follow the right procedure.  Could you not simply forward the email back to them that stated they would pay for the fence rather than debating the he said/she said and why? That is literally the only thing that matters.
