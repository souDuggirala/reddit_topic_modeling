TLDR at bottom

I work in the apartment industry and we had someone come to us who was trying to find housing for this family who are asylum seekers. Their story is really sad and i wanted to help them but they have no income, no money, no criminal/credit and the person trying to help them out is asking we sponsor/pay part of it (he said he would help too) and isnt a family member so couldnt be a guarantor. 

&amp;#x200B;

For all these reasons and that my company is not familiar with the specifics of people in that situation my boss said we wouldnt be able to help. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anywhere i can point them to to help them out? Its in DFW, TX and i saw a couple organizations on google but was hoping that someone would be able to suggest one they know is helpful/legitimate. Im not sure if these people are scammers but if they arent their story is harrowing and i would like to help any way i could.

TLDR- Can anyone suggest organizations that help find homes for asylum seekers, specifically talking about Texas.  Its my understanding they are, the person trying to help them said we could call the immigration office with him to confirm. I though it odd though that the immigration office wouldnt be doing something for them or pointing them to the right organizations and that these asylum seekers would be off on their own trying to find a place. Part of the reason why we were hesitant to do anything with them.

I was hoping the right organization would be able to vet things like that as well.  Are they here legally?
