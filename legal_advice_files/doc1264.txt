 Throw away, mobile, you know how it goes. I am going to protect my identity, as well as my family's as much as possible, please ride with me. There's a hospital near me, who had a doctor who was giving lethal doses of medicine to "end of life patients". 20 hospital staff have been tied to this. Nurses, pharmacy, and the one doctor. I had a family member who was in the ICU at said hospital for 5 days. My family member was doing well, considering the extent of their injuries. Then, everything went down hill. My family member had their lungs give. This surprised us as their lungs hadn't been an issue during this. When I searched online, we found out that when you overdose, your respiratory system shuts down. When we found out about the doctor giving lethal injections, we were scared. The dates that this happened to at least one other patient was within our 5 days of being in the ICU. According to the hospital, all but one family has been contacted. We called the number, and the hospital staff on the phone said they would contact us within two business days. I assume this is to give them time to go through their files to see if we were affected. When we reached out after two business days, they gave us the run around. The staff member couldn't tell us how we would be contacted (phone, mail, etc.), or if we were affected. We are all very scared, stressed, and anxious over this. Is there anything we can do to make them tell us if we were affected? Can they lie to us? Can they just keep giving us the run around with no definite answer? Can we do anything to make them give us an answer? We have talked about getting a lawyer, but we do not have the funds right now. If we were affected, we will some how make it happen, but we can't afford the lawyer unless this for sure happened to us. Locked due to being beyond the scope of the sub and the potential for shiposting. The only advice you need is to call a med-mal attorney immediately. Good luck.
