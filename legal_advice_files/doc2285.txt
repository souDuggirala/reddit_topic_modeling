 I am in Tennessee. Ex is in Illinois. My ex has had a wage garnishment in the past but he keeps jumping jobs. He was found to owe 60k with arrears and interest. They take his income tax return and send it to me but he pays nothing in the meantime. The child is over 18 now so I know he doesn’t owe any further money but I don’t know how to get him to pay. I’ve been dealing with the child support collection office in the state of Tennessee but they don’t really do anything on his case.
