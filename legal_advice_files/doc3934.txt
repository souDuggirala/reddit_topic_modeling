 What's the laws about slander? My son's dad has posted on Facebook and Instagram lies about me. He is not just expressing his anger he is telling people they should not trust me and to delete me. He's also making up personal stories about me telling people that I use drugs. That I abused my son. These accusations are false. This is Backlash because he lost his visitation. He's very unstable individual.
