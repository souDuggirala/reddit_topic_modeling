 A friend of mine recently found out that her toilet leaked into the condo below hers. The condo 'office' is telling the daughter of the downstairs condo that my friend has to fix the damage. She called her insurance agent and they said they would not cover it due to subrogation (or maybe non-subrogation)... can someone explain what is the truth? Is Subrogation an agreement that each tenant fixes their own condo regardless of where the damage started? Is this a state by state law? or a condo by condo law? What is her best course of action? She just got a terrible medical diagnosis and should not be dealing with this. Thank you in advance!  Thank you!  You need an attorney to review your covenant documents.
