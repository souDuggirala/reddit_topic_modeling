 A little background. In Seattle a lot of restaurants add a 20% “service charge” to every bill (our restaurant does this). The way our work does it is that 20% is broken down to this: 60% goes to the serving team, and the other 40% goes to the House/service staff(bussers, food runners etc.) however it’s our bosses who decides where the 40% goes. So lately during the slow season at work, we’ve noticed that on some night and almost all days they call off the bussers and food runners as there is just not enough business to justify having that much staff. However even if there is no support staff during that shift, we STILL have to tip out the 40% to the “house” and at that point our bosses can do whatever with it..... we all think this is incredibly unfair as we are having to do multiple peoples jobs and then pay them when they’re not even here..... so my question is this: we want to get a lawyer because this feels like they are stealing our money..... do we have a case? Is there a law that says employers can’t do this?  Isn’t OP in Seattle? That would be Washington.  [This]() outlines how tip pools work in Oregon. As a general statement, what they are doing is legal.
