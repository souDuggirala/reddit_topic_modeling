 So I’ve been offered a consulting job where I’ll be working from home which is in California. Within the offer letter there’s a non-compete clause that says I can’t go to any competing firm for 18 months from the end of my employment. The last part of the contract says “This Agreement will be interpreted under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia” Would this non-compete clause hold up if I decided to change firms?  In addition, employers have repeatedly tried the "interpret this agreement under X state law" to get around California banning non-competes. That doesn't work, it never works. You would think they would know better just by asking a California attorney. Worse still, if your employer does a bring a suit for the non-compete judges in California have consistently held that such a clause indicates that the employer knew about the law in California, thus willfully and knowingly violated the law triggering things like collecting attorney fees and other types of damages not usually available in a civil suit judgement. Nope, unenforceable  Yes they are legal, but california has a habit of not enforcing. You do this you risk it. California courts have consistently shut down NCAs for virtually any employee working in that state. Including state of law clauses in said NCAs. You should consider such a document an extremely large red flag, given that your employer is either ignorant of this or willfully ignoring it.  they are generally not enforceable in CA with very limited exceptions.
