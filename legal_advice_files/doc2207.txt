 I was driving then I hit black ice. I couldn't stop even with the handbrake on plus braking all the way. I hit a truck f150 and we both exchange information but the guy has no damage. My car has an estimated $400 damage. I know it's my fault. But the guy want to file an insurance claim but I don't want to go insurance because I'm scared of the rates going up. I am a G2 driver. I am quite lost and don't know what to do since this is my first accident.  1) Never use your handbrake to brake on ice. That's how you get a skid. Your normal breaks should have ABS, which tempers the breaking to ensure the wheels don't skid. If you don't have ABS, you shouldn't slam on the breaks but should either pump them or press down gently enough that they don't skid. You might want to consider an anti-skid driving course. 2) Go to a collision reporting centre. 3) If the damage is minor, you guys don't need to go through insurance and you can agree to pay him to repair his car. But it's his right to go through insurance if he wants to. If he does, your insurance rates will go up. Because you're at fault, any insurance coverage on your end will come from your collision insurance (which has a deductible) rather than the property damage insurance. The benefit of going through insurance anyway is the insurance company guarantees the repairs, has relationships with auto shops to keep rates down, and it ensures you're not paying more than your deductible. At the end of the day, you are probably going to be paying more for car insurance because it costs more to insure a driver who responds to a skid by using their hand brake.
