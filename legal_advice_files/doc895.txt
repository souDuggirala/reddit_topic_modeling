 TL:DR Can I be sued for ownership of my startup for using my current work laptop to work on an unrelated company idea? So Iâ€™ve been working at my company (startup) for about a year now and want to leave soon to start my own startup. I conceived of the idea on my own outside of work, and pulled in an engineering friend to do the coding work for me remotely. When I mentioned this to a coworker, they said that I may be in legal trouble for working on the business while being employed. I have written none of the code, but I have used my work laptop outside of working hours to edit online materials pertaining to the venture (pitch decks, business plan, cap tables, etc.) many times. I have on occasion worked on the idea at work outside of my specified working hours. The idea that I came up with is 100% unrelated to my current position or company. If this venture has a successful exit (3% chance), would my current company be able to sue me for any sort of contract violation or IP infringement?  Thanks for the advice here, I'll have to look into both of those items.  Awesome, thanks for the advice - I'll be sure not to do it moving forward.  The first two things to check would be (a) your employment contract and (b) the company's procedures manual. The latter is probably available in a break room or manager's office. Some companies, especially in tech fields, do tend to have clauses in which they control all of your output even if it's not directly connected to your current duties. Even if they don't, you may have an NDA or non-compete clause which would prevent you from even starting the new company within a certain time from leaving the current position. Does your employment agreement assign intellectual property you create to your company? This is somewhat standard. Regardless of ANYTHING else, this was a really bad idea. Do not do anything not work related on work issued equipment.
