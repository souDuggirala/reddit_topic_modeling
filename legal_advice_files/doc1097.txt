 Is this legal? Do I need a license?  [With a license it is legal to operate a business that produces and distributes CBD to those with physician certifications. Only five such licenses have been issued.]() It is not legal in Virginia. Virginia DOES allow CBD oil with a valid prescription. However, that allows you to purchase and possess, not to make your own, and CERTAINLY not to grow your own plants. Unless you're growing hemp, there is no such thing as CBD only marijuana. All marijuana has different levels of THC and CBD. I don't know Virginia's marijuana laws. IANAL but I used to grow tons of marijuana in California.
