 Hi all, I have an odd situation and am wondering what are my options. While driving in London 10 days ago I was involved in an accident with a motocyclist. It turns out my car was not insured, as I has been insuring a car I have never owned (mix up with cars paperwork on purchase). My car was impounded and I needed to pay to release it. On getting to the police station today (7+ hours from home) I completed my paperwork and the car was set for release ... but the officer informed me the impound yard was not replying to telephone calls, which is odd as they should have been open. I took an Uber over and after a back and forth with the security guard and another employee it was discovered the company in question had gone into administration the day before (and not informed the local police, who use them for roadside collections) I have to say the police have been very helpful via the 101 number but I am still minus my car as the company advises me they are not allowed to release any vehicles while under administration. I guess my questions are, what are my options here? Who currently owns the car? Can it be sold to satisfy debts on the company? The police have signed the paperwork to authorise my cars release but does the 14 day collection window still apply? Thank you for any help you can offer
