 My cousin had a verbal agreement with some artists for a party. They originally agreed on $450 and now the artists want $550 claiming they had more people work done on. They keep refusing $450 cash and want the $550. After getting my cousins address from the party hall they booked, they told them they will take them to court. I told my cousin respond to that with a lawyer, and its something you can't ignore. If there is no pictures, texts, since everything was verbally face, their claim of work being done on more people and their proof they showed us was a writing down random names on a paper saying that's extra people. How much of chance of winning do they have if they take my cousin to small claims?  The judge will ask for the contract. When no proof is provided, they will have zero proof $550 was guaranteed. Hell, you could only "remember" agreeing to $350. Please don't be dishonest though. Perhaps you can text/email them in an attempt to explain why they think $550 is owed when you agreed to $450. When they start saying "more work was required", that gives you some evidence that the originally agreed price was $450 and they bumped the price without checking in. Yes they are legally binding. there are some rare exceptions but this is not one of those. Proving the contract exists and the terms of the contract, like the agreed price, can be trickier than with a written one. Going to court, even when it's small claims, over 100 dollars maybe not worth the effort even if the facts support your claim, but that's up to you.
