 A random person has been DMing me on social media offering me money to meet up with him for sexual favors. If he sends me money and I take it (without going to meet him) is that illegal? Sounds like you could use some outside criticism. If you honestly came to this sub to find out if it would be legal to con someone out of thier money for the promise of prostitution, you definitly need some rethinking of your life. A psych evaluation would probably do you some good too. I really do wish you the best but, goddamn, you should really stop and think about some things before you go with the first condiluded idea that pops into your mind. So you want to scam someone and you're asking r/legaladvice for input? Not considering actually going through with it. Came here for answers not criticism. Thanks NAL Stop all communication with this person and move on without a second thought. Either way, conning said person out of thier money for the promise of sex and not delivering is illegal. Taking money of said person for sex and delivering on the sex is illegal. Why the fuck would you want yourself to be in this situation, anyways? Some rando is asking to pay you for sex and you're actually considering this? Stop making bad life decisions and sort out your fucking life. Jesus Christ.
