 I’ve already taken it to the police but it’s been over a year since then. The police didn’t really take me seriously and I felt stupid because I didn’t have any physical or hard evidence of the rape. I know the wheels of justice are slow but the guy who raped me is very dangerous and I’m scared for the other women in his life. I recently made a public Facebook post warning my friends and family about him. If this somehow gets around to him, can he sue me for defamation or anything else like that?  Yes, he definitely can. Whether he would win is a different question, but he could sue you and force you to spend money to defend yourself.
