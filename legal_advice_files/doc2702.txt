 So lots of people are criticizing Trump because of his policies, but let’s take a look at Canada. My great grandmother was Canadian by naturalization, but yet my grandmother can’t get the citizenship. Is it true that you can’t get Canadian citizenship through ancestry if your ancestor is naturalized and “old”? Country: Canada Cool thanks, strict immigration laws nevertheless  Generally, to get citizenship by descent, the parent has to be a citizen at the time of birth. Canada [does have a self-assessment tool](=en tui=auto) to wade through their complex laws. Follow up, she was naturalized in the early 2000s, which means that my grandma was born long before that somewhere in Austria  “old”? [The laws that govern who acquires Canadian citizenship and when]() have changed more than once over the years. So, the answer as far as your grandmother is concerned is going to depend on when your great-grandmother naturalized (before or after your grandmother was born) and/or when/where your grandmother was born.
