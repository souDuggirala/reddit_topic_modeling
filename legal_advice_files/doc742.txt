 It was super shady and I don't want to /haven't associated myself with him since, but I feel like Enterprise should know, it's eating me alive, but how can I tell them without them dragging me into legal trouble? He sent me pictures of the damage. Should I just say "Hi, John Smith rented a 2018 Generic Car from you guys a few months ago and I was just wondering if he told you guys about it." Nah, let it go. It should have been caught before the car was rented out again, and in my experience people are really terrible at "fixing things" so it was probably pretty obvious. My guess is one of a few things happened. They noticed it and wrote a report on your buddy, he's been dodging them, and he just won't be able to rent cars again. Or they missed it at first but eventually caught it. Because it was missed, the branch ate the cost of it. There''s not really a way for them to hold someone accountable if they missed it depending on how long it took them. In either one of these scenarios, that's just the cost of doing business for them. Unfortunately this type of stuff drives up the cost of rental vehicles for everyone. You're not responsible for your buddy and whether he's shady or not. Unfortunately, at this point, there not really anything they could do with that info anyway. Take solace in the knowledge you wouldnt do the same, and move on.
