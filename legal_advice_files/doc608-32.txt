My best friend (who is 21) accidentally left his Facebook logged in on his mums computer (who lives in a different city). She kept it logged in and monitored his fb activity and messages for over 6 months, compiling a list of everything she thought was inappropriate (including messages to girls he was dating and several from or received by myself) and then had the balls to call a family meeting where she read out dozens of messages. Obviously this had him shaken up and his relationship with his mother has turned incredibly sour. Is what she did illegal and a breach of his rights? Or is it just shitty parenting? 

Edit: We live in New Zealand  New Zealand has some motions in place it seems to handle more-modern issues, but you'll need to see a lawyer as [its current digital privacy laws](http://www.lawsociety.org.nz/lawtalk/lawtalk-archives/issue-834/criminal-liability-for-mobile-phone-spying-in-nz) aren't clear about unauthorized access to SERVICES belonging to another user. Everything in place seems pretty clearly referring to the hardware itself. Your friend's mother obviously is authorized to access her own computer. 

**tl;dr** - get a consultation
