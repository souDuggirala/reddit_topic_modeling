 So this isn’t exactly advice for me but I was just wondering, and people in this sub are usually familiar with the law so I live in Georgia(AOC is 16) and there is this 15yo girl who is having a baby with a 20+ yo. They are also engaged. Does them being engaged change the law and allow her to be able to give consent? Or is still illegal no matter what Ask questions if you need any more info  Yeah that’s what I thought, thanks Being legally married does change the law, but being engaged is not actually a legal status. This is a sex offense and I hope the appropriate authorities have been notified.
