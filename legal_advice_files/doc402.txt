 Can a QDRO be filed for a pension plan that was never part of the marriage? I got the job with the pension AFTER the divorce was finalized. We did not have any retirement accounts or plans at the time of the divorce. The only retirement account we had early on was emptied long before divorce was on the table. Also, current GF is worried that my ex wife can come after her inheritance and her property etc if we get married. Is this true? If so, how can we be protected?  Thank you Thank you Your ex wife cannot reopen a divorce once it is finalized to go after assets you acquired after the divorce. Even if she could your new wife’s inheritance would not be an asset that she could come after because it isn’t a part of your assets, inheritances are the sole property of the person who receives them unless they commingle the assets with other marital property. Assets obtained post-divorce are not subject to retroactive claims, not unless they were in some way hidden during the divorce proceedings. If your GF is seriously concerned about this and you're planning on getting married, you should speak to a divorce attorney, but this is what they'll tell you.
