 Say an artist draws pornographic art of a fictional minor from a fictional source. Can they still be charged with child pornography even though no real living minors were involved? I see it memed a lot on the internet with the widely-used "FBI OPEN UP" meme, but I couldn't find any real concrete answers or any records of arrests being made because of it. While itâ€™s a potentially open question as technology makes it harder and harder to distinguish between real and simulated pornography, at the moment the most recent Supreme Court case on point states that if the individual depicted is not a real person it is not child pornography. As long as the art isnt based off of a real source, no. Shadman is living proof of it.
