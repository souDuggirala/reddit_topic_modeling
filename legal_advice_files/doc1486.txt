 Is it legal, or is it a public disturbance? Is it punishable by any means? Depends on the malls policies, but as most are private property. If you are using the property for something other than it is intended, you could be asked to leave, and potentially trespassed/arrested for refusal to do so. Paging /u/RenMcCormack There's not generally going to be a law against just dancing, assuming you're not blocking people's path or whatnot. If you're on private property, such as a mall, you can be asked to leave.  You might want to check the city law.
