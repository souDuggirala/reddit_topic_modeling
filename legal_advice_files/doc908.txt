 So I live in Italy and for the second semester at my highschool, the staff decided it was a good idea to make the login credentials personal, previously it was all the same for everyone. The schools reasoning is so that they can track everything. I was wondering if this was legal and if I should use a VPN.  This is a legal advice thread so frankly i cannot comment on the technology aspect - a VPN should protect your privacy although I can’t say for certain. Regarding the legality of this, the school is perfectly entitled to monitor their students’ usage of the schools facilities. Here’s my advice - watch your porn at home.
