Long Story Short.

I need to find a way to get the "No Car Insurance" charges dropped. (State of Georgia)

Do i call the distract attorney? Im new to all this. I never had any issues on my record. Im concerned.  Oh thank you. The officer called the tow truck before he even stepped out the vehicle. When he came over i told him i had insurance and even pulled the papers out to show. But he kept having a strict attitude towards giving the ticket and taking my car on the spot.  If you can prove that you in fact were insured, pretty good chances. Had the same thing happen and they dismissed it  What are the chances of success on that? And thanks for the info Go to court show proof and the judge will decide what to do with it.  Contact the department listed on the ticket and show that you indeed were insured at the time you were pulled over.  They should dismiss the ticket.
