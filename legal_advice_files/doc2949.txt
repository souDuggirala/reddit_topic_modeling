 I've been seeing my boyfriend for almost a year, and we've been very cautious, and I haven't met his young kids yet. We are to the point where we are ready for that step, but there is language written into his divorce agreement, that they have to meet and approve who the other has in their life before meeting the kids. It's not a provision he agrees with, but he essentially did what she wanted when they split, and did not have his own legal representation. I'm not sure of the exact language, but could find out. It's becoming problematic, as we have tried to set something up to meet with her for quite some time now, and she keeps avoiding meeting with us. What should our next move be? How long should we document her pushing us off? Do we move forward anyway because of her refusal, knowing we have things documented if she takes us to court, or does this need to go to court first? What would a judge think of this type of stipulation? Anyone experience a similar situation?  It's really common, so probably not much. If your boyfriend wishes to pursue this, he should start by obtaining a copy of the agreement and taking it to a family law attorney to review. They can best tell him if he needs to go back to court or can have you met the kids without her approval.
