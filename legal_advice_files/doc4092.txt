 Hi! I had a unique employment situation. I was a full-time, salaried wedding photographer for a smaller company that specialized in weddings. I've since left that organization (7 people) and have moved on to something else. I didn't leave on great terms, mainly because I'm still being forced to shoot some weddings that had already been booked prior to departure all the way into next year. That's an entirely different legal situation, but just trying to give background. The issue I'm having is that my ex-employer is posting weddings that I shot and delivered on his blog. He's also writing as me, under my name. For example "I loved shooting this wedding, this couple is so in love, blah blah blah" . Is he legally allowed to do this? He owns the copyright for the photos, so that's ok and I understand that, but he writes terribly and is saying things that I would never say. It's posted under my name with my photo. Basically, he's covering his ass because he doesn't want my future couples to know I've separated from the company. He's also threatened legal action if I tell them. It's incredibly unsettling and I'm not happy about it. Even when looking this blog up, I see another blog that he posted and then credited to another photographer from the company. Is this some sort of misrepresentation that's illegal? It's definitely dirty, unscrupulous, and misleading. I'm just not sure whether I should get a lawyer involved... Cleveland, Ohio In terms of an actual legal claim, I think it might be hard to bring a claim in court unless you can prove up damages. However this could also be a situation where a demand letter might solve the problem. It looks like the Cleveland bar association had a volunteer lawyers for the arts program. I suggest contacting them first to see if they can help.
