 I am hoping somebody on this sub may be able to help me clear up some questions regarding my recent public intox in Milwaukee. I was taken in a few days ago for public intox but was released as soon as I sobered up and given what appears to be just a ticket for “Assault indecent exposure and Intoxication” as a part of ordinance 63.04. Can somebody help me clear up what kind of ticket/charge this is? I didn’t get anything that appears to be disorderly conduct or anything and the fine is about 450. Is this a civil violation or a misdemeanor? Any idea how it will appear on a background check? Can I do anything about it. I’ve looked online for the ordinance and ticket information but information is hard to come by. I know being drunk in public isn’t technically illegal in MKE so maybe this isn’t a misdemeanor? Any information or help would be great. Perhaps get a copy of the Police report once it’s completed to see what all happened for you to get those charges.
