 Good evening, Reddit! Here in Florida we have a lovely interstate which loves to go from 60 to 0 every couple minutes. Unfortunately, I failed to stop, rear ended someone, pushed a large amount of cars together, and caused a considerable amount of damage to a lot of very nice new vehicles. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but soon after the accident I discovered my insurance only covers the legal minimum in property damage. There's no way i'm able to pay this. What are my options? I don't have a job (i've been actively searching) and i'm still considered dependent, so I don't think I can file bankruptcy without it affecting my family. What can I do that'd have the least impact on my family? Thanks, Reddit!
