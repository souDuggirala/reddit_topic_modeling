 Posting for a friend. Her Ex is a co-signer on the ATV equipment they got for their kids. It’s being repossessed but it’s on his property and he won’t allow it to be taken away. The 20K in charges are going to be turned over to her if he doesn’t give it up. Does she have any legal action? Can she get a police escort to remove it from his property even though he’s co-signer? It’s on his property and he won’t allow her. I told her to call the police dept to see if they could escort her there to get it and she apparently is going to call tomorrow. She says he’s really difficult.  So can she just go get it? It's as much hers. Yes. Both names are on both titles, her name is first. Not sure if that matters. He’s the co-signer.  Is this thing titled? If so what name(s) are on the title? She may have ownership along with him. The situation is worse than I originally thought. For the ATV’s the agreement was he would make the payments, he got a 2 month extension in September due to the hurricane we got. But hasn’t made any payments since. She also has credit cards in her name for him, that she hasn’t paid on. So in short, she’s dumb and she’s screwed. 🤷🏼‍♀️ It's going to be handled by collections, and if they want to recover the ATV they'll have to pay repo fees. Any delinquent and repo will be reported on both borrrowers credit. If either choose not to pay anything, it'll be processed as a charge off. Location and possession of the ATV is not relevant to payments. The ex not wanting to turn over the ATV will be handled by the lender. Why didn't she make the payments? That is what she agreed to do. Is she on the title or just the loan? Is it even titled?
