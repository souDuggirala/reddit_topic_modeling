 Long story short, my brother has found himself in jail. but the thing is, his case all started with a “rolling stop” he promises he didn’t make, and thus the whole case could be thrown out if the cops dash video still exists. But his public defender won’t talk to him, he’s not allowed to go to his own arraignment, and every one at the jail is being forced to plead “not guilty” with no say in the process whatsoever. We are hearing it may be months before he even gets to go before a judge “because the jail is so backed up”. There’s no way our family can afford a lawyer, but I really feel as though this situation is unlawful. addendum- I know the law isn’t fair and I know that things never work how they should, but I want to know if there is anything I can do to make this right. Thanks.  I'm not a dude and I saw your post. Get a second job, sell something, take out a loan, cancel things, talk to lawyers about payment plans. If you want to do something, this is what you do. Hire him a lawyer. [deleted] The whole case doesn't get thrown out. If the cop reasonably believed he didn't fully stop, the evidence (presumably found in his car?) is still admissible, unless it's inadmissible for some other reason. Other than find your brother a private lawyer, there is not much you can do. What part was left out? People don't go to jail for a rolling stop.
