 I'm a disabled adult living with my parents. A while back a work crew at the empty house next door brought a dog and let it loose in the neighborhood. Since then it's been at our house chasing outdoor cats, stealing dog food, and jumping on us, leaving scratches and bruises. The dog also barks at all hours of the day and night. But, my parents solutions were as follows: 1. Shoot it. I freaked the fuck out and semi-convinced them not to. It's still an option to them. 2. Call the pound. I really don't want to call someone else to come kill the dog either, that's not better. 3. Steal it The one we're currently on, the dog is on a runner in our yard, choking itself to death cause it's not used to chains. Also barking constantly. They haven't spoken to the work crew about perhaps taking the dog home, or spoken with police or anything. We have a dog in our backyard fence that doesn't belong to us, and I'm scared they're going to come arrest us all for theft and abuse, and I want nothing to fucking do with it, but I'm stuck here and I don't want to be culpable for these idiots' actions... Tell animal control this dog is menacing people and animals on your property. Provided you live in the jurisdiction of animal control for your area, they’ll come get it and attempt to find its owners. If they can’t find its owners, it’ll likely be taken to a local shelter or rescue. [deleted] How did that not make it on the list? Call animal control.
