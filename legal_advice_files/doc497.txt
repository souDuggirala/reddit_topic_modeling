 That's a wide-open question. Did the contract have a due date? On that date, was the deficiency material (like, invalidates the entire reason for having the contract in the first place) or was there substantial performance (got most of the job done, but failing in some details). Note that unless a contract says that time is of the essence of the contract, or words to that effect, due dates are presumed to be flexible up to a point. Where a due date is a hard stop, the consequences of failure generally need to be spelled out in the contract.
