 Quick little thing, I’m on mobile. This takes place in UT. At my job, I equal opportunist retailer, there’s sales associates and Leads of departments (LOD). You can be hired on as either or move up from sales to LOD. That’s what one co-worker did four or five weeks before I tried. Also to note we work shipments together which are 16+ hours a week alone. Basically we get along and what not. My store had the opening and I really needed to go full time.. Though my manager just brushed it off saying something “oh that’s a lot of work and we’ll see.” I thought that was weird cause I’ve been working their for over a year and a half while my other co-worker has been here for six months. I tell him about it and he just says “Manager won’t move you to LOD because she told me if I took the position you couldn’t.” I of course get the wtf face and ask why? The reason was it would be A conflict of interest for two friends to be working together as LODS. Even though we both don’t talk to each other outside of work. So the big question is this legal? What should I do? I just think it’s all childish, specially if they are going to get Butt hurt if I get a second job that I desperately need. To add more I am not friends with this co-worker. It’s roughly 8 hour shifts from 6:30 A.M. to 2-3 P.M. I have no outside contact and of course like most places you become close and buddy like with your other higher ups. So I do not see how that can be a problem. Also I just may be bitching cause they’re bitching at me. To add more I am not friends with this co-worker.
