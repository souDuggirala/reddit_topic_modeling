 So my step mom used to work at old folks home in Texas and she got injured while working, and they were paying for her medical care for about a month, and all of a sudden they found a reason to fire her today (allegedly she was telling clients to go to a different home) She had a surgery scheduled for the injury coming up. They wanted her to sign some sort of agreement (she didn’t read it) and she said no she wouldn’t sign it. She wants to go speak to a lawyer but I told her to hold off until I posted this here basically.  Thank you, will advise her to do this  Yes she was on workers compensation, I feel as if it’d be pretty hard to prove that’s why they fired her though but I shall advise her to seek an attorney  Many will provide a free consultation for a wrongful termination case. She should explore that.  If she should spend money to go seek an attorney  No  Was she on workers compensation? If so, this could not end well for the old folks home if your mother can prove they fired her for filing a workers compensation claim. She should speak to an attorney to see what her options are.   Well, was she? Yeah, definitely seek an attorney. IANAL but i'm thinking clearly illegal if as you described.  What’s your question?
