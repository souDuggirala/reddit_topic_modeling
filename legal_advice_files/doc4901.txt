 Lets say a person was involved in an automobile accident and files an insurance claim. They assess the damage as a total loss. They send a check in the mail, the check is cashed. Then, days later, after having conferred with the other insurance company and revisiting the police report they have decided not to accept liability and call to inform the person that the check has been cancelled, but it has already been cleared by both banks. Would this person be held liable for legal actions against them if the insurance company were to demand the money back? Or is it their fault for making a mistake? They have not alleged fraud.  Lots of missing facts. Did they allege fraud? If you committed insurance fraud to obtain the money, paying it back will be the least of your concerns. The money has not been spent, as far as I know. You may want to contact your state's insurance commissioner on this. Something is seriously wrong here for an insurance company to send a settlement before even doing the most minimum investigation.
