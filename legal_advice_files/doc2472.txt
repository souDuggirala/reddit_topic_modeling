 Yes they would attempt to reverse the asset transfer. Especially if there was a good claim that your husband died with some form of separate property. If it was challenged by a creditor it doesnt mean they can go after me does it? All the information was under me and never included my name. If my name is on the deed along with soley my name on the accounts they cant legally go after me correct? That doesn't mean that it can't be challenged by a creditor. If the debt is small you may want to pay it so it goes away. If large, you could check with an estate attorney. Before my husband passed away he filed a quick claim deed giving all rights to the property to me. He also drained his soley owned bank account which we later closed with a balance of three dollars. He did not leave anything left on his name before his death. The only thing that was still his was a saftey deposit box that we removed the contents on after his death. No, his estate is responsible for the debts. Essentially, the bills died with him. You will probably need a death certificate to send to them to make them go away. They will probably try to get you to pay, just refuse to sign anything and hang up. How does he not have an estate? Just because it bypassed probate doesn't mean there necessarily wasn't one. Do you mean the estate did not have any assets after creditors were paid?
