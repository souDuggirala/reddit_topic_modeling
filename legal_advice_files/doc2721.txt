 Hello everyone new here. My friend is have some issues on social media with a wanna be gangster/ felon with multiple violent charges such as strangulation and kidnapping ect. Anyway this man has been calling and messaging her saying "he killed one of her friends a while ago " and threatening now kill her too, needless to say she is a bit worried. She is also worried if she goes to the police her problems might get worse. My question is would those threats be enough to put him back in prison if he is on probation or parole? Or any advice on what she should do? Go to the police, show it to them, and ask them what they advise. They deal with situations like this all the time and know how to go about it while protecting the innocent party. Your friend should go straight to the police with the messages and call logs, this man seems violent and deranged and she could be in a lot of danger  If she's afraid he's going to hurt her, she needs to call the cops. That's the only thing she can do.
