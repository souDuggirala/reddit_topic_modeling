 Good evening, We are Flat-Rate mechanics at a Dealership, and some of us will be forced to work an event on Thursday evening which requires public speaking, but as to who, is not decided yet. We work 7:30-430pm, the event is 6:30-7:30pm, with added prep time. We are being offered 2 hours flat-rate pay for compensation, and no one wants to do it. My questions are as follows: Can an employer force an employee to speak in front of a crowd? How much notice is required to give an employee before they are forced to work over-time? Does an employee have any recourse if they are "Let go" after denying working this? Any insight is appreciated, it's all a little overwhelming. Nah genuinely all good. Being overwhelmed with information was my biggest issue, and just needed help with it.  Sorry mate :( Hope things end up ok. Appreciate the information. Cheers Mango 1) Yes. Not liking public speaking is not a protected class. 2) None. Scheduling is at the discretion of the employer. 3) You would likely need to be given notice or pay-in-lieu of notice, but you can be fired for any reason that's not protected, or no reason at all. Note that if you are part of a union, you may be subject to different rules. In that case, you should ask these questions to your union rep as they would have more information than we would. -rate pay for compensation After 8 hours you're required to be paid time-and-a-half. If your prep time takes 20 minutes, that would be about right. For further information, see
