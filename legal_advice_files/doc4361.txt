 Or get them investigated. I’ll make this a long story short. Popular EDM artist was booked at a local club. People were waiting in line for 2 hours. Security wasn’t scanning any tickets or conducting any searches. We were all at a standstill while staff had their fingers in their ass. Executive hosts were walking up and down the line saying $50 skip line pass for a line that wasnt even moving. Once they finally started letting people in, they extorted attendees some more by telling them they had to pay upwards of $20 extra because they were wearing a hat, shorts, joggers, or a tank top for a club that has no dress code. A lot of people who already had tickets missed the main act because of how everything was being ran. The bathroom attendees were also illegally selling cigarettes inside of the bathroom. How can we all collectively take legal action against this club? The EDM community is PISSED. // ATL, Georgia USA Aside from possibly the selling of cigarettes, it doesn't look like anything illegal happened. Yelp is likely your only recourse. Oh no!
