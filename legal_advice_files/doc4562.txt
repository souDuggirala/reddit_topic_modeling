 My channel basically revolves around finding educational, funny, interesting, etc. Clips that I find on the Internet. I use sites like Reddit, GyfCat, Imgur, Instagramm, Facebook, 9Gag, etc. to find these clips and more often then not the poster of the video doesn't know provide the source to the video. I try my best to find the original Poster but I can't always find them, is it still legal to use the material? To be clear, I provide explanation about the Content that I upload, so it counts as CreativeCommons. Youâ€™d need to look into the fair use laws that cover the jurisdictions in play. Often it requires a transformative act of some kind and minimal use, so you could potentially be covered No, you violate the owner's copyright if you make a copy of their video without permission.
