 HELP: After having PetPlan Pet Insurance for over 6 years, I found out the other day, after taking my dog in for a checkup because he was sick, I no longer have the insurance (which was on autopay) due to it lapsing in May. I was unaware of this but was told they tried reaching me; as far as I know, I was never contacted. Two days later (today), I got a call from the vet saying his bloodwork came back and he has diabetes. The thing is, the insurance won’t cover it because they consider it a pre-existing condition. Does anyone know what I can do to escalate this? I know it’s my fault for not checking to make sure the pet insurance came out monthly, but I’ve been paying close to $100/mo for 6 years (since my dog was a puppy). I feel I was a somewhat loyal customer and they should cut me a one time deal. Any suggestions is greatly appreciated!!  unfortunately at this point its going to be up to the pet insurance ultimately since its basically 6+ months time has passed. Also, it would be up to them to see if the would retro the account back to May and then it would be another battle in regards to the diabetes coverage. But I would still call, explain the situation, and see if anything can be done for her. I’m commenting on behalf of my sister who asked me to post this. I believe she told me that she attempted to file the claim, and was told by her insurance that the auto pay stopped or the last payment went through in May of this year.  how long ago did the payments stop? 1 month? 6 months? 12 months? If its been quite a few months, then I doubt they do anything as so much time has passed, however if its been a week or so maybe they can but it would ideally be up to them to make that accommodation. Beyond that, not much legally can be done, as the responsibility to ensure payment is on you and only you the owner. Did the autopay just stop? The general answer is you are responsible for making sure the premiums are paid.
