 My father hired an Egyptian lawyer after he left back to the states to see his options to get back the gold and or sue someone. My father eventually realized the lawyer was up to to scam my him and my father ran away as fast as he could. He’s a busy man so after a while my father exhausted all he knew he could do and eventually let it go. He couldn’t even stay in Egypt to fight for it because he needed to head back home for various reasons. Now, my father is planning a trip sometime for next month or for July to see what he can do. He had tried to let it go since he felt like there was no way of getting it back and he didn’t tell us until now. We were riled up and honestly in complete and utter shock that my dad would hide something like that and now we’re urging him to go back to Egypt with us so we can do something or at least try to do everything we possibly can. What can we do?  Why did it get seized? Did he not declare the gold? If so, it's long gone Find a better lawyer over there.
