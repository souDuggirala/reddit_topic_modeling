 There is a kid at my high school selling vapes to underage minors and has blackmailed a girl into sexual acts under the threat of leaking naked photos of her on his snapchat story, but as far as I know it is all unsaved. Is there anyway for the police to access this? There's probably a chance bro.. If shes being extorted definitely get her safe.. Call the police and report the person threating revenge porn.  A victim's word is evidence. There's still a chance. So if the blackmail was months ago thereâ€™s no chance then? I believe there's a 30 day limit snapchat stores the images posted in there platform. If the police was fast enough then they should have the images or whatever they need. They can access anything still stored on Snapchat's servers. Snapchat doesn't, as far as I know, publish a retention policy, but you should assume that "deleted" Snapchat messages are available for weeks or months afterwards to Snapchat employees, and thus to law enforcement.
