 My mother was being sued for monetary compensation in New York State. She passed away suddenly in early December, but my brother and I were named co-defendants in an amended summons a few days prior. It was a crazy month after with putting her affairs in order, and I realized that the amended summons state that a response was required within 21 days - We had not responded within the time frame. The attorney that my mother retained stated that no action was needed as an automatic stay is placed on the case upon the death of a party to the case, and that my brother and I did not have to worry about having not responded within the time frame specified. My question is - is my mother's attorney correct? Will a default judgment be entered against me if one of the parties of interest in the case passed away suddenly, and another named defendant failed to respond to the amended summons?
