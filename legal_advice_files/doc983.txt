 My roommate and I entered into a lease in September 2018 for a one (1) year period. We live on the top floor of a 6th floor walkup. In October, our ceiling began to leak -- there were water stains on the ceiling and obvious dripping onto the floor. We took photos and immediately reported to our landlord, who eventually acknowledged and "repaired" by placing a new layer of plaster directly over the leaky area. This same process then repeated several additional times over the following two months. As of today, my roommate and I have large chunks of plaster falling from our ceilings on a daily basis. Additionally, water is now dripping through the recessed lighting in our living room ceiling, which seems like a fire hazard. The top of our living room wall (where it joins the ceiling) is slowly separating from the ceiling, and is showing clear signs of mold and water stains. We have reported these issues to our landlord on a regular basis via email, complete with pictures. We have politely -- but firmly -- requested these issues be addressed. On the rare occasion we are provided a response, the landlord says these issues cannot be fixed until it stops being cold and rainy. We have also reported the issues to 311 (NYCHPD) but have yet to be contacted by an inspector. The last time the landlord conducted repairs was prior to Thanksgiving. At this point, we'd like to break our lease and move. What are our rights (if any) to do such / or what further action could we take to compel our landlord to resolve these issues? I think you would need to some how get the apartment certified on being unfit for occupancy.
