 Today I was browsing Reddit. And I looked in my messages and got this. I have done nothing against the law, and yet these people are trying to get my information. Yeah, I troll sometimes and I have different opinions on subjects but Iâ€™ve never once broken the law here. What do I do? Should I tell my parents.
