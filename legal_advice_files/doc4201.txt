 An officer came to my house as "PR" event to make people aware of the ordnances during the winter. At my house I have a vestibule (enclosed front porch) before the front door. The officer entered my vestibule, without my permission, just walked right through the first front door and went inside the vestibule. Once he got to the second front door, he looked through my window, noticed a pipe and some pot sitting on my coffee table. He then proceeded to give me multiple tickets. Does he have the right to enter my vestibule without any of the homeowners permission? Is this worth fighting? I'm in Wisconsin.. Thanks! Peace officers are allowed to access any route the public would normally use to reach your front door. The rule is if a Girl Scout would walk there the path to sell you cookies then a cop can too. Unless you have a no trespassing sign that specifically says police are not allowed in your vestibule.  Probably. In the normal course of his duties he was asked to knock on your door, and observed in plain view evidence of illegal activities.
