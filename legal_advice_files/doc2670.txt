 A few days ago, my girlfriend and her friend were out with a few other friends. They were all smoking weed and the driver wrecked the car into a cornfield/ditch. According to everything there, the road had no sign to indicate that is was a tee. The car is fully insured and no licenses are suspended. The friend driving agreed to pay for the damages to the car. The friend wants to have her boyfriend do all the repairs so they don't have to pay for professional service, my girlfriend and I are both very opposed to that. The friend has been very hesitant to pay the insurance deductible of $1,000 because she thinks her boyfriend can do it for $400. Today we found out that the car is actually totaled and the friend is now unwilling to pay anything except for buying a $1,000 car. My question basically is what options do we have in making her payout for wrecking the car. This is in Illinois and both are over 18. My absolute guess is that it would because it shows some sort of negligence in operating the vehicle.  If the car is totaled and fully insured then go through your insurance then go after the driver for the deductible. I am actually not sure. It might if itâ€™s brought up and under certain circumstances. Thanks for the quick and detailed response. My last concern would be if the weed makes a difference or not in the matter. Get an estimate then prepare for a small claims case. Depends on the value of the car. If it's $10,000 or less, your girlfriend can sue in small claims court (no lawyers needed); if it's more than $10,000, then your girlfriend can either take a haircut in small claims and attempt to get $10,000, or she can retain a lawyer and sue in big-boy civil court for the full value.
