 Background: we live in northern CA. My SO has lived in his apartment complex for a couple of years. I moved in with him last summer. He makes $80k a year and the rent is $1,200 a month. Paying rent was never an issue. However, due to the schedule of paying debts and dues and when he gets his pay, he asked the property manager if he could pay rent on the 15th of every month instead of the first. He was told that wasn’t a problem. So he’s been doing that for the last 16 months. We’re applying for a rental. All was going great until we just got a call letting us know that we were rejected because our current property manager said that we paid rent late 16 times. There was an agreement here between my SO and property manager but unfortunately nothing in writing. My SO is going down to the office to try and get something in writing. That’s the only way the prospective property manager will allow us to continue with getting the new rental. Let’s say he can’t get anything in writing. Are we completely fucked? What do we do? Are we stuck here?  Find a LL who will rent to you? So, what are our options from here? Are there any? As to not be stuck at this apartment until further notice?  What does the lease with landlord state when rent is due by? If it is the 1st or 5th with grace period then he paid rent late for the last 16 months. He should tell the new landlord what the arrangement was and then tell the new LL the rent will always be on time in the future.  It's not illegal to tell someone you paid rent late. Regardless of him saying it was ok or not you paid rent late.
