 The laptop has some stickers pointing to the owner being from Texas, and yesterday my wife saw a college aged kid waiting in our parking lot area (shared lot in apartment complex, but where we park only fits 5 cars so usually we recognize everyone parked there). As soon as he saw her pull in, he sped off in what looked to be a panic. My wife noticed the plates were from Texas as well. Personally I would love to just sell the laptop as it would recoup our immediate losses and then some, rather than turn it into the cops and hope the kid confesses instead of saying his laptop was stolen too and the thief must have dumped it on us. But could I be held responsible if the police somehow found out? What are my obligations here? In Arkansas. Turn it in to the police. The laptop may be stolen property the thief left behind.  That computer is likely stolen as well. So yeah, it would be wildly stupid to sell something you know was stolen. The police will just come for you, there won't be any kid at the station with you to confess, just you getting wrung out for selling stolen items.
