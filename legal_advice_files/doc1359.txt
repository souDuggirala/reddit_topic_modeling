 Hey, so im sexting with a 12year old girl (im 13 years old) at the time i was sexting i didnt know the consequences. the only thing i knew is i was having fun but then i learned the truth about sexting and deleted all of the photos and block her, but what if she told it to police can the police arrest me overseas? yes im not going to do it again Who knows? Immediately stop and do not do it again. so am i safe? Incredibly incredibly unlikely.  im from asia shes from europe [removed] [removed] Thank you. im panicking :( now im relieved We need location I won't do it again, thank you im relieved.  It depends on where you’re located. It’s possible for you to have consequences from this. It’s also possible for her to have consequences from it too, so it’s unlikely for her to call the police. If you go to school with her, I’d tell her you discovered it was illegal and that you don’t want either of you to get in trouble so it needs to stop. If she threatens to turn you in, you need to talk to your parents. It wouldn’t be good for her to do that though, as she would also get into trouble. You probably won’t go to jail but it can have some serious consequences. Don’t do it again. Gonna need your location for a more precise answer. But I'm just gonna say you're over reacting, I'm pretty sure it's your hormones talking but I'm confident she won't go out of her way to report you  i didnt know about it i thought its normal for teenager to send nudes i know i already did all of that You're going to jail, buddy. Nah, I dunno. I am not one for knowing much legal stuff.  Delete the photos, stop talking to her. Also stop sexting .  [removed] so can i get arrested? im cryin what the fuck Location matters.
