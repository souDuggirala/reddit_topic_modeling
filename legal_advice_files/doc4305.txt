 Hi, Paying premium rent in FL which includes climate control. I can adjust the temperature in my unit, but I can't change from A/C to heat, or vice versa. We've have a cold snap and I can't turn on the heat. I've asked the manager who says "unless we get complaints from enough residents, we leave it on A/C." Do I have any recourse here? I'm sleeping with a jacket on now. I know it's FL and some might not think it gets cold, but it gets cold enough to be unpleasant. Plus I'm paying for climate control. Here is Florida tenant law... http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/florida-landlord-and-tenant-duties.aspx .51. Landlord's obligation to maintain premises -family home or duplex shall, at all times during the tenancy, make reasonable provisions for: Since it appears that the entire building is either A/C or heat - they might be able to pick up the cost and additional utilities for a couple of space heaters.
