 A couple months ago, I realized I had a small sum sitting in a 401k from a company I worked at years ago. There was actually two companies. I thought cool I’ll transfer the funds to my new job. The first one transferred the funds within a week The second.... can’t even get ahold of the woman. The 401k company said all they are waiting for is her signature of approval. I’ve left her numerous messages and she will not answer my calls or call me back or even just sign the documents. What can I do? I would really like this resolved  Make a final attempt to contact the woman, perhaps by voicemail and certified mail and mention that failure to comply is a reportable violation of federal ERISA laws. Report her violation here if she fails to fix the situation on her own:  I am going to assume this lady is the administrator on the company's 401k. I just asked my financial planner/licensed broker (we share an office) and he said: If she will not answer you, you need to file a complaint with the Department of Labor. She has a responsibility as a fudiciary to follow your requests. You may not be vested, so the company's match might not be available, but the funds you put in are yours. Exactly. First company no problem. I feel like this lady is either just horrible at her job, overwhelmed, or doesn’t want to release it.  I called the account holders for my 401k and they released it without issue after thirty days of non-employment.  So the company that has my funds is waiting for this lady’s signature that it’s okay to release them to me. The company will send me a check that I will put into a savings account with my current situation  When you say "the 401k company" do you mean the one that is currently holding the funds or the one you want the funds to go to?
