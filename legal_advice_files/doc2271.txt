 Hello, I cut my TV services two months ago and immediately returned all of the equipment to the provider. Last month i received a bill from the cable company charging me $1000 for the "lost" equipment. I called numerous times and they told me each time that it was a billing error. However, I received the same bill from them again. I called them and asked to speak to a supervisor, they put me on a brief hold and hung up. Called again, same story. I do not know what to do. They might send it over to collections. What should I do. Have you been to the local office and demanded that while you are there the problem is corrected and maybe even given a credit because of the hassle they put you through. I had to do this a few years back. It was miserable.  Dispute the charges with your credit card company
