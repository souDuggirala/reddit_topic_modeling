 I was busted with a decent amount of cannabis concentrates and got what the cops are calling a "very light punishment". My charge on paper is only for possession and doesn't indicate an amount of cannabis seized. I'm worried when things go to court this "very light punishment" could turn into something much larger. In MS the laws for Hash/Concentrates are extremely strict and the punishment varys by amount. What should I do? I actually have the option of reaching out the to cop that will apparently be testifying against me and asking a few questions, but I'm really afraid to say too much or the wrong thing and screw myself over. I also don't want to lawyer up if they're trying to let me off easy because then I feel they may try to throw the book at me even harder to make an example.
