 I'll try to keep this short. I live at an apartment complex that is adjacent to another apartment complex. My place has a parking garage that we're allowed to use, but it's far from the actual apartments. So to curtail this issue, I park at the visitor's parking at the apartment complex adjacent to mine. My question is this: can I legally be towed by parking there? I have a parking sticker on the back of my car that clearly indicates that I live at the place that I do.  Alright thanks. I wasn't sure and didn't want to risk it. You probably saved me like 200 bucks ðŸ˜… Yes you can be towed for parking in their visitor parking when you are not a visitor to their property. It would be the property management that would have you towed. There are usually signs posted indicating what service they would use.
