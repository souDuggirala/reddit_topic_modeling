  So recently at my high school (in Georgia) some kid was telling people he was going to shoot up the school. My friendâ€™s little brother (a freshmen) heard about it and posted on Snapchat warning people. The post went viral in my community and made the news. The school handled the threat, found the kid, and everything was dealt with. Later I I found out that my friends little brother who made the post was given 10 days out of school suspension, a misdemeanor, and now has to go to juvenile, All for warning people about a threat. I was wondering if anybody had some advice about what my friends family could do. Thank you. He should have gone directly to the school, his parents, or the police. By publicizing the threat, he could have made things worse. Your friend's family can consult a criminal defense lawyer. And should. He essentially was send the threat also instead of reporting it
