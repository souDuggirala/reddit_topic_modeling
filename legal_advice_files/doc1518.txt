 So I have fmla for several different reasons. Recently I applied to a new position and me and the hr manager had a discussion on whether or not fmla would hold me back. He has hinted strongly several times that he hates fmla and thinks its unfair. The problem is I have none of this in writing. On avg I use about 4 weeks out of the 12 in a year. I work in pa and at a major retailer. My father in law said he feels even though I may have a case that I would be blackballed from it  Typically employers cannot discriminate based on FMLA as its protected. The issue is proving it and damages. If you are denied a promotion and you feel it was solely based on your fmla status, you'd need to see a lawyer. I guess a workers comp lawyer? Maybe they can point you in the right direction.  He is also the same manager that came out and said that I would probably never be promoted because he could not put someone in a department that is using fmla for coverage reasons. He also said that I use to much of it. He is the one that said I would need to wait for my wife to expire before promotion and that if he was a manager he would have fired me a long time ago because of me being absent.  No. Merely hinting that the manager doesn't like FMLA is not grounds for a lawsuit.  Could I have a lawsuit Okay what's your question?
