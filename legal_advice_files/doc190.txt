 Do companies keep records of disputed credit cards? There has to be some kind of bread crumb trail right? My mother took credit cards out in my name and racked them all up and didn’t make payments on them a couple of years ago and I was young and dumb and disputed them without doing anything. Is there anyway to take legal action? How would I go about getting enough proof? Or is this not a good idea? Because I lived in a town 3 hours away when she had the cards... plus I never went home so where she made the purchases they were no where near me and she didn’t pay any of my bills or anything. I was self sufficient Unless you have received notifications telling you the disputes were resolved in your favor. If you don't have any such records, then it would be best to get your current credit report so you can review it. If you’ve disputed some of the cards would they still be in the record at the company? So like where purchases were made and such? Because all I am needed is like the hard copies of things or is that not how it works First of all, you will need to get a current credit report and see how many cards were opened fraudulently and when. You will need to see the current status of these accounts. Now comes the hard part, to legally dispute these credit cards, it would require you to file a police report for credit card fraud. So think about this and decide if that's the direction you want to go.
