 I work as an assistant manager for a place that auctions off property. At the end of the workday there wasn't enough cash from payments to meet the balance. Since I was responsible for taking payments, I was blamed for the missing cash. Now my employer is demanding that I personally pay the missing amount. Is this legal? I'm pretty sure I didn't sign anything agreeing to this, but I'm not 100% sure and I don't have access to my hire-on documentation. If I quit, what I do if they deduct it from my final paycheck? Good to hear. Good luck!  Thank you so much for your help with this. I found a blank copy of our hire packet and there are no policies listed at all, just a direct deposit authorization and W4 etc. The company is based in another state so maybe they think they're legally entitled to deduct my wages since the check is coming from CA. Either way, I'll definitely be fighting this. Yes. Numbers five and six from the third link I posted, - employees should of course have access to whatever policies will apply to them - an unknown policy cannot be used against an ex-employee in an unemployment claim or any other kind of employment-related claim or lawsuit. Which means you have a right to view your hiring documents and read them, as to be notified of your employment standards. It also means that even if they had you sign a document holding you liable for deductions they would not be able to use it against you in court unless you knew and we're fully aware of what you were signing.  Thanks for your advice. Do you know if I have a right to view my hire-on documentation to see if I signed anything related to this?   Texas is a state that has "at will" employment, so your employer can fire you if you refuse to accept the deductions. As above, if they do that then it is illegal. If they do it anyway then file a complaint with the Texas DOL for wage theft. They will take it from there.
