 Hey everyone I am about to propose to my girlfriend and we have both decided that we wanted to get married in in town hall by a judge rather than with a priest or pastor in a church as we are not religious at all. I understand that I must go to my local law clerk and apply together with her for our marriage license and must bring certain paperwork such as legal identification, etc before we can get married. My question is is that I live in New York State and she lives in New Jersey. We will eventually be moving to New Jersey together or rather I will and we will be purchasing a home together so my legal state of residence will be changing within the year of us getting married but we wanted to get married before moving. I wanted to know basically which state we should get married in and if we got married in NY for example, would it be legally recognized in her state for her while we live separately until we close on a house until I can establish residency there. Or should we get married in NJ as that is where we are going to be living? Even if we did that only she currently lives there and I live in NY. I'm new to all this so any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you reddit! You can get married in whichever state you like. That's part of why we have a Full Faith and Credit Clause in the Constitution. Get married wherever you want. Get married in Hawaii if you want to. It will still be recognized in any state you move to later. Just check the local requirements of the state where you want to get married for marriage licenses. Some require that you and fiancee be physically present in state for a couple days before license will be issued. For example, iirc, Texas requires 72 hours before applying for marriage license.
