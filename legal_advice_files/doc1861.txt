 48-year-old, eldest child of a 70-something, apparently irresponsible mother I love but am not close to. Several years ago she and her boyfriend dropped everything ran off to the Virgin Islands together. After a stay of 6 years or so they returned with very vague explanations. On a whim I did some online research: turns out they defaulted on a mortgage down there, got sued by the condo association for years worth of nonpayment of dues fees, etc. She now lives in the States but has an approximate $300k judgment against her (accruing interest at a mind-boggling rate, too) and a "Writ of Execution" from the court. As far as I can tell all the trouble is in HER name, and she currently lives in a home owned by her longtime fella, to whom she claims to be married but I can't find any evidence of it. They live on social security, and she does not know that I know any of this. I doubt she plans to actively deal with the situation. What happens now (re the Writ of Execution)? Can I/should I get involved? Can they seize property and/or the home she lives in (it's not in her name)? And selfishly: can I at some point be held responsible for this idiocy?  Interesting. Thank you for that.  That correct but not life insurance. Creditors cannot generally intercept life insurance proceeds for debts owed by the deceased. They'll surely file liens against her estate when she passes away, correct? Probably won't be anything of value there but I assume the lineholder(s) will get first crack, up to the amount owed, right? They can't take property that she doesn't own. There's nothing for you to do to "get involved" in. You can be held responsible if you foolishly talk with creditors in a way that you accept the debt as your own. Debts do not survive death of the debtor, after the estate is closed out. USVI I'm in NC, she's currently in SC British or US Virgin Islands? Where are you located?
