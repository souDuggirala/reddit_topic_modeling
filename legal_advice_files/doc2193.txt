 Last night I replied to a Craigslist ad for a one bedroom apartment (I live in Massachusetts). It seemed to be going well up until I gave a small summary of myself, where she immediately replied "sorry females only". Is this legal or does it violate discrimination laws?  Who is the other tenant? I am assuming the real estate agent is representing a landlord. Fair housing applies to landlords not other tenants.  Is this an apartment building, or an apartment inside someone else's (the owner's) house?  If the property is 2-4 units and the landlord lives in one of the units, this does not violate federal law. Otherwise, it is discrimination and violates the Fair Housing Act. How can you say that without more facts? How do you know the Fair Housing Act doesn't apply? Its a one bedroom apartment so no roommates. I'm not sure about how many units the owner has, but this was said to me but a realtor. In an apartment complex? Also add your location and stuff. Make that edit to your post smh. IANAL It was by a real estate agent through Cambridge Premier Realty  The "she" in your message is giving people the impression it's a roommate not the landlord you contacted cuz you didnt say that exactly. It is a one bedroom apartment with no roommates though. Legal. It's only a problem if the sexes are reversed.  Is this for a roommate situation? How many units does the owner own? No it's legal
