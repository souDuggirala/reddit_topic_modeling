 Our 2010 Mazda 6 had a recall on the sub H-frame because it rusted out. The recall is paying for that damage. The frame though fell onto the axel and damaged it and now we need to pay just under $700 to get it fixed. The dealership has written emails to Mazda saying that the frame is in fact the reason why the axel broke. Mazda says it is not covered. Any help or ideas?
