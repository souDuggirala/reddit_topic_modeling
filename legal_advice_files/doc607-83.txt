Hi everyone! I'll try to keep it short! 

Basically, my roommate's dog got stung by a bee. 

We moved into our townhome in a community of townhomes in August.
The townhome next to ours had a beehive growing in their wall. 
About a month ago, my roommate's dog stepped on one of the bees and had to go to the ER, before going into anaphylactic shock. 
She had to stay over night and the whole thing cost them around $900.
The morning after, my roommates went to go talk to our neighbors and they said they've tried to contact their landlord/HOA since summer, but they haven't fixed it. 
I think my roommate got the email of their landlord and a day later, someone came to fix it. 

If the landlord/HOA was actually being negligent until an accident occurred, is there anything we can do about it? 
(The dog lives there legally, pet deposit and everything) 

Thank you for reading this post!  Same result. Sorry. It was our neighbors landlord that was contacted (not ours)  &gt; If the landlord/HOA was actually being negligent until an accident occurred

There's no negligence in the facts you gave us. A landlord doesn't have a duty to make the premises bee-proof, nor does he have a duty to remediate a bee infestation on someone else's property.

&gt; is there anything we can do about it? 

No. Sorry.
