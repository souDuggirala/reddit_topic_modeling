 Totaled my car in a deer accident last Tuesday, got a rental same day. 2017 Camry, went over the whole car. I drove to work twice, no problems. I was told to return it Friday night after hours outside of their gate. Come Monday, get a call that there was damage under the passenger side rear bumper, down to the metal, $250. I went to pay my rental fee, and the rep never showed up. I looked at the car, and it’s a minor scratch on the underside of the bumper, which is plastic. Now she’s quoting me $450 after actually getting an estimate. I know for a fact I did not cause this damage. What recourse do I have? I have frozen my cards for transactions with them.
