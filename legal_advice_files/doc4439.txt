 Fiancé was offered a management position by a store manager via text, applied for said position, had application approved and filled out paperwork for health insurance and the manager certification. Is now told that position is null and void and that he is starting at the bottom with no coverage. He tried to ask her what the deal with and showed her the original text messages only for her to call his attitude “threatening.” He’s absolutely pissed and this store has had a massive history of mismanagement with the current one being the fourth in 2-3 years. Do we have any legal options? And could this impact him applying for a plan through the ACA market place?
