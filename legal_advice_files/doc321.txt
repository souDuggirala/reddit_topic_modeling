 Early last year, while driving in Massachusetts during inclement weather, I was struck by an out-of-control delivery van and sent spinning into the wheels of an oncoming tractor-trailer. I was completely uninjured, but my vehicle was totaled, and the police on the scene directed my vehicle to be removed by a local tow company ("TowCo"). By the time I was done dealing with police and EMTs on the scene, my car had already been towed, so I got a ride to the tow yard, retrieved some personal belongings, and signed a standard-looking release. Five days later, my wife (the registered owner of the vehicle) went to the tow yard to take a final look and retrieve any other personal belongings that may have been left, and was told that she was required to sign two forms in order for the vehicle to be released to our insurance company: a standard-looking "Vehicle Release Authorization" form, as well as a "Direction to Pay" form, which included the following language in the fine print: "I fully understand that, ultimately, I am responsible for any and all costs occurred for this service if the insurance company fails to pay the costs." A week after that, our insurance company ("InsureCo") completed their damage assessment and declared the vehicle a total loss. They also informed me that the TowCo had been uncooperative in allowing their agent access to the lot where the vehicle was stored, and that they were demanding excessive payment in order to release the vehicle (I believe they may have initially been attempting to charge a higher, voluntary towing and storage rate, rather than the state-mandated maximum for involuntary towing, possibly based on my wife's signing of the "direction to pay" document). A few days later, InsureCo issued a check to to the towing company for just north of $1000, which InsureCo claimed was fair market value for the towing and storage fees accrued. Based on itemized invoices later sent to me by TowCo, this amount would indeed have covered TowCo's tow/hook fee, fuel charge, tow mileage, tarp rental, and 20 days of impound fees at $35/day. A few weeks later, when calling to check on the claim, InsureCo told me that TowCo was still being uncooperative in allowing them to retrieve the vehicle, but since the dashcam footage from the accident had been reviewed and the delivery van's insurance had accepted full liability, they offered to process my claim through subrogation, which would allow them to pay out the claim without access to the vehicle. I signed the subro paperwork, which contained an agreement to keep the vehicle and/or dispose of it myself as part of the claim, but was told that InsureCo would continue to deal with TowCo on my behalf. The next month, my wife and I began to receive telephone calls and letters from the TowCo claiming that InsureCo had "failed us as customers" and abandoned the vehicle, which was still accruing storage fees. They advised us that they were in possession of signed paperwork that made us liable for these fees, recommended that we either pay them ourselves or pressure the insurance company to pay entire sum they claimed was owed (initially an additional \~$700), and politely threatening to pursue "any legal remedies" necessary to be paid. InsureCo advised us to sign a blank title transfer for the vehicle and send it to them, which we did; it was forwarded by them to TowCo. The letters and invoices demanding payment due continued, including one with a photocopy of the cashed $1000 check from InsureCo, with "accepted under duress" scribbled on it. A month later, I was told that InsureCo had internally escalated the issue and offered to pay TowCo an additional $500 to settle the matter, but that the offer was refused, and TowCo claimed they would accept nothing less than the additional $1375 they were now claiming they were owed. At this point I filed a formal complaint with the Mass DPU Transportation Oversight Division re: TowCo, and stopped hearing from them; I'm not sure if those two things are related or not. I hoped that would be the end of it. Fast-forward to yesterday, over six months later... I received a phone call from InsureCo letting me know that they had been contacted by TowCo and advised that a small claims suit was being filed, and wanted to know if I'd received a summons yet, offering to provide me with legal counsel if so (NB: I have not been summoned yet, either because this is an empty threat, or because I've recently moved to a new address in a new state, and I'm assuming a small claims court summons won't get forwarded by USPS change-of-address). Additionally, today I received two pieces of forwarded mail from my old address; 1.) one from TowCo, with a copy of the old invoice for $1375 with some new math hand-written on the bottom, claiming that they cannot legally dispose of the vehicle because "\[they\] rec the title it was not filled in," citing an additional 221 days of vehicle storage and over $7000 in new fees, cc:'d to InsuranceCo's CEO and a local attorney; and 2.) a letter from the local attorney, stating that they have been retained by TowCo regarding collection of an outstanding debt for $9500, for which no payments have been received, demanding the complete balance, made payable to the lawyer's office (unless I dispute the validity of the bill). Up until this point, I've just been referring TowCo to InsureCo whenever they contacted me, because honestly the whole thing felt like a low-effort extortion scam by TowCo, and I've been more than willing to follow InsuranceCo's direction, since I'm ostensibly paying them to deal with this stuff... but this seems to be escalating. What's my legal CYA here? At what point should we be considering hiring our own lawyer to deal with this? Was settling the claim with InsureCo through subrogation a mistake that will come back to haunt me? Should I just be waiting to receive a small claims summons and letting InsureCo represent us? Is it a bad idea to contact TowCo's attorney directly and dispute the debt? My wife and I are currently in the process of attempting to buy our first home, and she's getting stressed out that this will somehow get sent to a collections agency and tarnish our credit before we can get a mortgage. Not trying to threadsit, but just to be clear, InsureCo's offer was "if you're served, let us know immediately and we'll get one of our lawyers to represent you in court," not an offer of general access to legal counsel in the matter. In order to get proactive, should I be looking for my own lawyer at this point? Or should I just be contacting TowCo and saying "I hear you may be trying to sue me in small claims court. Here is my current address."...? Thank you, it didn't occur to me that the lawyer making the debt claim may also be the one filing the suit. I was under the impression that the small claims process was geared toward laypeople, and that TowCo would be filing themselves. I'll plan to call the lawyer's office on Monday, confirm that everything is on the up-and-up, dispute the debt, and ask if he's filed. You could give the lawyer a call and see if they have filed, but past confirming that everything is as it seems I wouldn’t talk to their council. As far as getting served, I’m not sure exactly what should happen. Looks like in mass the sheriff serves a summons so I would think they should be able to find you. Like I said, be proactive. Take your insurances lawyer and get out ahead of this. So instead of being perpetually worried about what could happen you’ll be well informed. The lawyer appears to be real; the letter is boilerplate, but the contact information on the letterhead matches that of an actual attorney in the county where the TowCo is located. I'm not trying to ignore a potential summons, but I'm not sure how any of this works... like, can they just make an effort to serve me at my old address, shrug and say "well, we tried," then render a summary judgement against me when I don't respond? Thanks, I'll add a tldr. You should probably take your insurance up on the offer of legal representation then work on finding out if you’ve been summoned. If you haven’t yet then determine if the lawyers letter is in fact real. If it is let your insurance companies provided lawyer get to work. This is what you pay insurance for. You don’t want to ignore a summons or have to fall back on the claim that you moved and never received it. Then you’ll be fighting a default judgment which will be an uphill battle.  I have no idea how to solve this, but I would not be hoping that by not receiving the summons that it will just go away. The last thing you want is a default judgement because you didn’t show up to a court date you didn’t know about.
