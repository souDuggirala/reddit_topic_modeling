 So I work for a very recognizable fast food chain, a franchise branch, and I have recently discovered that my store has been falsifying termination papers saying that employees have left their jobs willingly instead of saying they were teminated without notice. Is there anything that can be done? I'm pretty sure that's illegal? I've been at this job more than a year and I'm afraid if they decide to fire me I will get screwed out of my unemployment. It would only be an issue if it held up an unemployment claim. That eases my mind a bit. I have watched them do that exact thing to 4 people. Fire them then the paperwork says they quit and the manager bragged about doing it. It is not illegal, and that paper has very little to do with unemployment. In most states the company has the burden of proof that you quit. Short of a written resignation, an egregious violation of company policy with proof, or a mountain of write-ups, you're getting unemployment.  If you're fired for any reason but gross misconduct you will probably qualify for unemployment. The issue would be if you were fired and they tried to claim you quit in which case you can challenge the claim.
