 Recently posted an item on OfferUp and got a message pretty quickly referring me to send a text to another party who would buy it. I went ahead and sent a text and after a long back and forth, this person sent me a cashier's check for 9x the listed price of the item. He(?) asked that I forward most of this to a venmo account to cover "moving fees" for the people who would pick up the item. Well obviously everything about this was fishy so I put a hold on the check and finally the bank called me today to let me know it was fraudulent. I never gave up the item or spent the money. I intend to report the OfferUp account and the venmo account but beyond that I'm not sure what legal actions I should pursue. - Is it even worth filing a police report? - If I do file a report, I would gather a copy of the check and a record of our conversation and both phone numbers we used to text, is there any other materials I should try to out together? - Is there any way to protect MY privacy if I go to the police? In particular I have no interest in turning my phone but do want to share the text conversations. How can I keep them from having access to any other data I have? Thanks in advance for any advice! Cops will probably just take your report but that's about it. Too much of that going around. Glad you had some "common sense" most people don't and they get scammed. I personally wouldn't bother. Reporting to police that "there's bad guys out there somewhere in the world" isn't something that I need to waste my time on. Do you think it's not worth filing a police report? It happens (or is attempted) thousands of times every day. There's really not much you can do about this. It's like trying to keep the sidewalk dry during a rain by catching one drop. Thanks, I kinda figured as much. I wish there was something I could do to trace the source so this doesn't happen to other people.
