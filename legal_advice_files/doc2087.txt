 Does this mean If I purchase the property I have to have a 30' wide driveway along the length of my property Can I fence off the property and just allow anyone who needs to go across it to go through the open gates   Yes. As long as you're not impeding access, you can fence the rest of the property. As to whether you can lock that gate and give every other owner on the road a key... will depend on a 'reasonable' call. It it's hunting land they access once or twice a month, it's likely reasonable to secure it and give them keys. If it's their residence or business and traffic is daily... it's probably unreasonable to burden them that way.  Ok so it sounds like it can be used for ingress, egress, and to run utilities. I have a similar one on my land. It does have a gate at the boundary with a lock and anyone who has access granted via the easement has a key to the gate, which is legal in my state (WV). The easement goes over 5 adjacent properties to allow access to a road at the end Yeah, you need to know--is this an easement that runs over your land (meaning it benefits a neighbor and you have to accept 30' of access across your land)? Or is this an easement you can use over your neighbor's land (meaning it benefits your land and burdens your neighbor). Whose land does it run across? Yes, but if I purchase the property I would have the same easement on the adjoining property at it has on the one I'm considering buying An easement allows someone else legal access to part of your property. You can’t make any substantial changes to the area as you don’t fully own it and must allow access to it by others. Think of a utility pole that may sit at the edge of your property. Sure, the land is yours but the company has an easement to use that portion of your land. Don’t mess with it until you’ve spoken with an attorney in your area.  Who does the easement benefit? An adjacent property?
