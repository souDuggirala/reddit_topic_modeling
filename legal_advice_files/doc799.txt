 I have my ID number via a photo of my old ID. That ID isn’t expired, and I also know my social. So you’d think, oh just get a replacement ID! But the thing is, I’ve moved. So I can’t get a replacement because that’s a different form than an address change, and on the replacement form I don’t think it says anything about changing your address as well. Wtf do I do? I’m kinda embarrassed to call and ask.  Wow I can’t believe I never found this on my own. Thank you.  Well yeah. It’s mine though.  What you do is not steal someone else's identity from a picture of their id and their social security number.   [Change of Address]() [e.g. you do not have a California ID], please complete a [Change of Address]() (DMV14) form and mail it to the address listed on the form. A change of address does not require an in-person visit to a DMV office. For more information, please refer to the [Frequently Asked Questions]().  I was able to get a replacement ID via mail and when I called I gave them my new address out of state. I didn’t need to show proof other than verifying over phone who I was.
