 I signed a contract to renew the lease for my current apartment for another 12 months from Feb 2019 to Feb 2020. However, my neighbor has been extra-noisy lately and make me want to move out. I looked at the contract today and I saw that the date range is wrong - Feb 2018 to Feb 2019. I was just wondering if I can use it as evidence to get out of this contract. Can someone please let me know if i can still get out this contract legally? I do feel bad about this but I've been working 12-14 hours a day and my neighbor playing music way too loud every night and I can't get enough sleep. I just want to find another apartment complex with better sound-proof walls. I really don't think the date thing is gonna do you any good tbh. You were renewing the lease and obviously agreeing to 2019-2020. It's like if a cop spells your name wrong on a ticket, ya still gotta pay it. I would make note of the time and date whenever your neighbor is being too loud and address it with the landlord, preferably in writing. You could suggest that to the other neighbors that are being annoyed too. The landlord might be helpful, he might not be, worth a shot though. Does your lease say anything about excessive noise/quiet hours/etc? If the neighbor is blaring music really late at night it might also be worth it to report a noise violation with the police. Extremely unlikely that a simple typo would invalidate your entire lease. Also unlikely you'll be able to find a sound-proof apartment but I feel your pain. Have you tried talking to your neighbor and/or landlord about the noise problem?
