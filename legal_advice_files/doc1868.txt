 My girlfriend's parents are in the process of getting divorced and her father proceeded to empty their joint account and is now recklessly spending all of the money in an attempt to file for bankruptcy so he won't have to pay any kind of alimony or other monthly payments to my gf and her mother. My question is A) is it illegal for him to empty their accounts and leave his soon to be ex wife pennyless and living paycheck to paycheck and B) is is illegal for him to recklessly spend that money to weasel his way out of paying them anything?  A) No B) No There’s no crime in spending the money from a joint checking account, but the divorce judge isn’t going to think too highly of it. Mom needs a lawyer to get the accounts frozen.
