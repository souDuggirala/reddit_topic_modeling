So I order a package almost 2 weeks ago and I've now encountered several problems and it seems like a lost cause at this point. The USPS sticks by there tracking information and says to the best of there knowledge the package is at my apartment complex. However every employee I've talked to denies having it and denies any possible way they lost it. The only possibility I've been offered is that someone at the apartment complex may have returned it to sender and apparently they keep no logs on that. They also never sent me a notification that I needed to pick it up. What should I do about this situation or am I just out the 140 dollars since both establishments have done nothing but blame the other. Ok let me know. I might be able to GPS it tomorrow if I can get a hold of a computer Okay thanks a lot, my local post office is closed but I'll do that as soon as it opens in the morning. Much appreciated The supervisor at your local post office can check the tracking and if it was scanned delivered, can GPS where it was scanned. 

 Crazy I actually just went through a VERY similar situation and it turned out the carrier (UPS) lost my package. I would reach out to the merchant and let them know they need to issue you a refund. Thatâ€™s what I did. Got my. Money back and re ordered the item.
