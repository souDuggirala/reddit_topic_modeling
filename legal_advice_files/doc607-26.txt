At my school, the teachers are falsley acusing me of bathroom griffiti. Their only evidence is that some of the hand writing looks a little similar to mine. I tried explaining to them that when I walked into the bathroom, I saw the graffiti, but that didn't do anything. I'm most likely going to get suspended for something I didn't do, also why would they care so much about this bathroom grafiti, when I see grafiti in a lot of bathrooms nowadays. Did I mention they are trying to get the police involved and do a criminal investigation. I really need your help. [deleted] My parents met with the principal today but even if the police came how would they find out if it was me or not [deleted] I am worried because the people that went into the bathroom before I did who were the ones who did it lied and said they didnt see any grafiti meanwhile I was the first person who admited to seing the grafiti and that makes me look like I did it [deleted]
