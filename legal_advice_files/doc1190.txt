 At the end of 2016, I started working as a full-time employee at “Company X.” Midway through 2017, my boss tells me I need to sign a form because they are starting a new consulting company (“Company Y”) and I’m going to start getting paychecks from them instead. Red flag. I ask if my pay and benefits will be the same, ask about my new responsibilities, etc. and my boss assures me everything will be the same. Until December 2017, everything was the same but the name of the company that paid me. A couple weeks before 2018 my boss bring a similar form saying I’m being moved back to “Company X.” Things don’t go smoothly, as they let my medical coverage lapse and then lied about it. One thing led to another with them committing fraud and asking me to lie to auditors, and after I called them out they ended up firing me. Today, I received a W-2 from “Company X” and a brand new “Company Z”. I did receive a severance check from “Company X” about a month after separating, but that dollar amount does not match what is being reported on this second W-2 from “Company Z.” I want to report them to fraud, but where do I go? Straight to the IRS for them falsifying a W-2, or is there somewhere else? Additionally, is there a statute of limitations on a wrongful termination case? I am in California, for what it is worth. You can report your concerns to the IRS, but you might want to wait until the shutdown is over. The statute of limitations varies depending on the type of claim and circumstances. So you would need to determine the basis for your claim.
