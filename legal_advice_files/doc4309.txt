 I got my fake id taken yesterday and they got the license plate of my friends car and the police called him. They are looking for the person who attempted to purchase alcohol with a fake id (that’s me). I was caught before and charged with false identification and MIP. But I was considered a minor in my state so they tried me as one and got 6 months of diversion and community service. I am pretty sure it got taken off my records but Idk if that can change anything Please let me know if you have any answers for me and I’ll answer any questions if you have any He put me in He was the one constantly asking me to buy for him and when I finally did this happened Caught twice now for fake ID and trying to acquire alcohol. Seems you are making poor choices around alcohol... please consider treatment or therapy, or I don’t know... not drinking alcohol for a while? Frankly I think your friend should rat you out so you face the consequences for your poor choices, and save himself of further issues with the law (which you put him in).  [It is probably a class III misdemeanor](=53-180.05) but specific details can make things worse. Speak to an attorney before the police. What can I be charged with  You haven't asked any questions.
