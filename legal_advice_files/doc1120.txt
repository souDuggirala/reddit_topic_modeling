 My roommates and I are currently sharing an apartment among 5 of us. However, the apartment is large enough to fit another person. This would cause us to exceed the 5 person limit set in the lease. We are considering having another guy bring a matress, and share a bedroom with one of us. What defines this person living in the apartment? Could we not just say he is a friend staying temporarily? Just curious if we are in danger of eviction for doing something like this. Thanks for any help Yes, I agree. As both an attorney and a landlord, knowingly moving another person into your unit that would violate the lease isnâ€™t a good idea. The LL will surely find out, and best case scenario the new person is going to get kicked out.  Landlords can limit how long guests can stay, how many nights a guest can stay in a set period, etc. What you are doing will lead to eviction because landlords aren't stupid.  If the landlord or manager gave you a "cure or quit" notice, or exercised another remedy under the lease (like a fine or penalty), the dispute would eventually end up in front of a judge, who would consider the totality of the circumstances. They would consider the landlord's evidence and testimony, and your evidence and testimony. In most circumstances like this, a landlord will give a "cure or quit" notice and you can "cure the breach" by having your excess tenant move out. But you become that person's landlord when you let them move in, and you don't want to find yourself again in front of a judge if you don't give that person proper notice to end their tenancy. If you moved in an additional person yes you would be in danger of eviction since you would be violating the lease.
