 My (16) friend (16) has a video of me in my house that I didn't give him consent to film. It is nothing sexual in nature, I just don't want him to have the video. Is there any way to make him delete because I didn't give him consent and it was in my house? Thank you Nothing legal you can do, no. Best you can hope for is that your friend relents and deletes the video because you asked him to. Calling someone stupider and don't know what they are 'taking' about.... how interesting.... I can not speak for Canadian law, but please explain to me, where a person under the age of 18 has full legal authority to consent to any contract or legal interaction, without their parent. Yes, certain states/countries have provisions for minors to consent to certain conditional legal matters, i.e. having a job. In relation to the above item, if the video is not sexual or criminal in nature, what recourse does this person? I doubt they have the financial means to get a legal battle over it. I doubt local authorities will get involved without a significant crime. Get your parents involved. If its something you're not proud of, then you got to figure something else out. Everyone who reads this will be stupider for it. You have no idea what you are taking about. Youâ€™re a minor. You can not legally consent to anything. Have your parents talk to his parents
