 My friend has had her twitter account hacked by a racist guy who has posted racist tweets on her account (he is Caucasian Puerto Rican, she is a minority). He has also hacked a site with her credit card, ordered things fraudulently, criminally trespassed on property, and has been extorting her and her friends. We have contacted the police, FBI (for extortion threats), and local court. Besides a temporary restraining order, is there anything that can be done legally? Luckily the police detective have an open investigation, but we would like to further proceed. []() \[one of many trespassing proof\]([]())
