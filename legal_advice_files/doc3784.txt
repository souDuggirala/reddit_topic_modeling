 I hope this is the right subreddit. I received a grand jury duty summons and it states the minimum service is 20days. I am a dietitian in a nursing home and am responsible for the care and monitoring of ~250people. It is just me and another part-time dietitian. My work place has given me a letter asking for deferment of service due to hardship on the business and patients. But, I have never done any kind of jury duty before and have a few questions. Is this a legitimate reason to ask for deferment? Should I ask for an dismissal instead? Who do I give the letter to? Thank you  Thank you IANAL but I've been to a few jury selections, judges tend not to excuse you if it's a hardship on your employer. Ask your work if they pay you for jury duty. If they don't, or only pay for a small part, when the judge asks the hardship question say you won't be getting paid and can't afford it. In my experience anyone who brings that up gets dismissed. They might still try to put you on a shorter trial so maybe use this if nothing else you try works. Good luck!
