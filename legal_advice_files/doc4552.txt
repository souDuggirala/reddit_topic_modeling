 Hi I took out insurance with a "insurance broker" that falsified my details to get me a cheaper quote. I was unaware of this and I was pulled over where I gave my details. At this point, the officer in question told me my date of birth on the insurance does not match the details I have given. I was completely shocked and it was obvious that the broker screwed me over. Now in the UK, if you commit a driving offence and have only been passed for under 2 years, you get banned! As well as 6 points on your licence. My career is now on the line because of this. What could I do in terms of not getting banned as I have complete proof of me sending the correct details to the broker. Thank you. /r/legaladviceuk
