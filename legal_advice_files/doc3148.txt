 My ex and I recently split and it was less than amicable. He was using my credit card while he was out a job and now he's refusing to pay the remaining balance. Are there any legal avenues I can pursue or am I going to be forced to pay it off myself? Take him to small claims court. Meanwhile, keep making payments bc the debt is in your name.  You can sue him. But you won't be able to get the debt out of your name since you allowed him to use the card.
