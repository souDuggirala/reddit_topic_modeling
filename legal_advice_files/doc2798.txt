 Our department switched to a new payroll company this year and we began to notice our paychecks decreased soon after. After a whole year of getting the run around when asking why our checks are different, we finally had a coworker ask a cpa friend to investigate. We discovered prior to using a 3rd party for payroll our prior in house administration included our certification pay (firefighter, hazmat, instructor, emt, etc) as an increase to our base pay and did not separate base pay from certification pay. The new payroll company told our new boss that calculating base pay with certification pay is illegal and had to be changed. Is this the case or is up to each individual employer to decide? This change took place in January of 2018 and we found out about it today. What are my options?
