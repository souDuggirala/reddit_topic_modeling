 My partner and I signed a lease thinking we'd find a roommate to live with us. A week later, we realized it wasn't going to work for us, so we notified the landlord immediately. Here are the facts: We haven't paid a deposit, so no money has changed hands. The lease isn't the standardized lease for Ontario, it's some other lease with different formatting and similar (not identical) wording. We signed a week ago. It's 5 1/2 weeks until we were supposed to move in. When I spoke to the landlord on the phone, he was (understandably) pissed off. I told him we weren't confident we could find someone suitable as a roommate and we didn't want to waste any more of anyone's time. He thought I was lying and hadn't really looked for a roommate when we have in fact posted online and gotten zero responses. What, if anything can the landlord do to legally retaliate in this situation? If the landlord is unable to find a new tenant, you might be held responsible to pay rent until he does.  Yes, you could be sued for breaching the contract.
