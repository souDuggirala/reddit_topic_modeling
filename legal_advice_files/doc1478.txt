 Just a quick question, I recently had my juvenile records destroyed so does that mean when I apply for a entry level job I can put down no on the application when they ask if I have a record or no? (extra question if I was to join the army do I still have to tell them about it since it'd be a FBI background check?) thanks in advance May depend on the state but most juvenile adjudications are confidential unless you were waived to adult court (only serious crimes are eligible for this, such as murder, arson, rape, etc.), so you should be okay.
