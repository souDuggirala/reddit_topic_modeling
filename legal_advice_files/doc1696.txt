 Just received an email from a VP of Operations of this technology company and I happen to be one of the 20ish cc’d emails used for theft and fraud. Basically, this student used my email address for an app that is all-paid services and have been declining paypal transactions for 1.5 years. She used her real name along with her school email address so it was no brainer who this person was (happened to be one of the close friends before). Apparently, she made thousands of dollars of purchases that she never paid back and I’m scared that my email address - which shows my full name - will also be associated with whatever legal action they will be taking. Who should I talk to? And also who at the university should I seek on this matter? Should it be the dean? Frankly, I am also so stunned that my email was included and very afraid what other websites she used my email on...
