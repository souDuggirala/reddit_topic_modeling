 Hello all, I have a question. I was in a car accident about 2 months ago. I sustained some injury, nothing too serious (whiplash and soft bruising/muscle sprains). I have been going to a doctor and physical therapies. They helped. I decided to hire a contingency based lawyer (in hindsight, I should have) to help me out. They reviewed my case and photos before taking on my case. Here's the problem. supposedly my car didn't suffer enough damage (bumper smashed in) and the third party insurance might not pay for my medical payments. The reason I went with this lawyer is because she was highly recommended and I was told if they were not able to recover, there would not be fee. The doctors I've gone too are in network with my work insurance. When I went to the them the first times, they said my insurance card was not needed because they would bill through my lawyer. However they all asked me to sign a document saying something like "regardless of the outcome of the case, patient will still be liable for any fee that might incur" Now, on the off chance, the third party insurance is not paying for medical bills... am i on hook for my physical therapy sessions and doctor visitations? No, they have you sign those documents to acknowledge that you are being seen by them as part of an ongoing personal injury case. In personal injury cases, the medical treatment gets paid for out of the settlement. Those documents are signed so that the doctor can put a "lien" on your case. This lien means once a settlement is reached between your lawyer and the insurance company, your lawyer will speak with any doctors you have seen and negotiate the price of the medical treatment you received to ensure that you and your lawyer receive as much money as possible. These documents are signed in almost all personal injury cases, so it is nothing to worry about. Your lawyer will sign it after you do and will take care of it. Hope this info helps and best of luck to you!
