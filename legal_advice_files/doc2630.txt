 \[VA\] My family bought a small piece of land (one acre) recently on which we plan to build a house. When we went by to check the progress, we noticed that the power company (Virginia Power) has added a utility post and supporting cables on our land. Now, this really isn't an issue, but unfortunately they placed them in the middle of where the driveway was going to be. Is there anything that can be done to remedy this issue? Our realtor / contractor / everyone involved with the sale and construction of the home tell us that there is nothing that can be done aside from moving the driveway over to the side of the post and cable. Yeah sorry I edited my post after. If would probably be worth double checking their easement. Sometimes utilities do just dictate where something has to go as a condition of giving you service, and there’s not a lot to push back on.  My guess is that the power company does in fact have an easement granted. But my dad did all the paperwork and is currently out town, so I can’t confirm. Did you purchase title insurance? Did anyone look at the title commitment? Or a survey showing existing easements? There is likely an easement granted to the power company, which if there is, would likely give them the right to put a pole there (depending on the language, but usually they are pretty broad).
