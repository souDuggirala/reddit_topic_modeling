 I wouldnâ€™t be able to enforce all laws of every country  It's Facebook. I'd imagine that happens on a daily basis. You need to chill out with this anxiety about creating a Facebook group. Either do it or don't. There is no need to keep asking questions about this.  What laws do you think YOU need to enforce on a FB group? And what law enforcement agency do you belong to that enforces these laws? Depends on the content. Kiddie porn or sex trafficking? Yes, you will be liable.
