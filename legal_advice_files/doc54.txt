 My s/o's ex boyfriend, who kidnapped, abused, and almost murdered her while in Vietnam owes her ~ $2000 (conservative estimate) in various expenses, including an agreed upon 50% of a replacement iPhone, which he stole and later broke. Understanding that $2000 is not that much money in the grand scheme of things, and that this could probably be taken to small claims court, I worry about the danger he poses. He is violent, volatile, and my s/o has vocalized concerns of him coming after her on numerous occasions. What can be done while effectively keeping her safe? Even if she won in small claims court, it's entirely possible that she'd have trouble collecting from him. That would prolong her contact with him and I'm just guessing that losing in small claims court would really piss off the ex and make him more hostile, more volatile, more violent than he already is. It doesn't seem worth pursuing for the possibility of getting her money back. Small claims in New York because it is under $3000 ($5000 in NYC). But do you really want to kick the hornets nest with this guy? It’s not really a legal question. If you file a case he will have the opportunity to be present and you’ll have to interact with him. Seems like something you’d want to avoid for $2000. It was abroad, and there is no physical evidence. Id be more concerned about the kidnapping and attempted murder than i a phone?
