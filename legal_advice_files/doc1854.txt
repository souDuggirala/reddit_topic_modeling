 My mom got into a car accident recently. She was driving when a 19 y/o kid rear ended her and took off the entire back corner of her car. She was fine thankfully. The cops came, took everyones information and did a report. There was even a witness who stayed and gave a statement to the police saying how the kid was driving recklessly and was the cause of the accident. My mom is able to drive her car to an autobody place that we know very well through a family member. She then gets a rental car because she has work the next day and there is no other way for her to get around. After all of this it comes to light that the other driver does not have insurance. What in the world do we do now? My moms car isn't totaled, but the repairs are out of our budget if we have to pay out of pocket and collision was recently taken out of our own policy. Also, we have a rental car that we were expecting to be reimbursed for but now we dont know how long we can keep it with the current situation. Any advice on what do do would be much appreciated! We have all of his contact information, photos of his licence, and plate number in addition to photos of the damages and police report (obviously). If your insurance doesn't cover it, all you can do is sue the kid. It's probably going to be difficult or impossible to collect much though, given his age.
