 So i got a car from carvana. Gave them my trade and down payment. For those of you who dont know about carvana they are an online car dealership that offers a seven day test drive period during that seven day period you can drive it get it looked at by a mechanic, also if anything breaks during that period they fix it or decide to take it back and get your money back and possibly trade back as well. On day 2 of my test drive period my engine pretttty much blew up head gasket and all. They towed it. Got me home. Got me a rental. Now theyre telling me my only options are to take my money and trade back or pick a different car from their line up because the repair could take all of january because they dont want to pay for me to be in a rental during the repair and they dont want to pay for the repair. But they said they are going to repair it and sell it again and i could possibly start the whole process over. How do i get to stay in a rental and make them repair the car we have contract on? I like your idea to be honest thanks  Can you post what the contract says? Because the contract may not be final until after the 7 day test drive. Check your contract - but the answer is, you probably can't. And for Pete's sake, you don't want to do what you want to do. Once a car has a problem that severe, you want to stay a million miles away from it, even if it supposedly gets fixed. This is doubly - no, triply - true when it's going to be a financed car. You should take them up on reversing the sale and count your lucky stars that you're not stuck making payments on a piece of junk.
