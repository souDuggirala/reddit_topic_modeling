 Not sure if this is even the right sub. I posted it on here cause there’s more people on this sub, than at r/needadvice So I just got hired at Officemax as a copy and print associate. During the first interview the assistant manager said I would be making $15.50 a hour since I have 2 years of experience in this department (I have 2 years experience at another store) regardless of part-time or full-time Then I get another interview with the store manager and he tells me something different. He tells me for part time I will be making $13.50 an hour but if I do full time then it’ll be $15.50. I thought the pay was based on experience, not by if you work part time or full time. On a different note, he has me working ALL closing shifts Monday-Friday. How can I approach him and ask him for a few mornings or swing shifts, instead of all closing?  My training is in the morning (which I would prefer) but after training I’ll be doing 2-10pm (if I choose full time) or 5-10pm (if part time) :( For the shifts, it could just be a training thing. I schedule one department closing shifts for training.l because that’s when it’s both busiest and there are other duties to complete.  As long as your pay rate is told to you prior to working the hours its legal. And you say to your manager "can I please work mornings or swing shifts, instead of all closings?" Perfectly legal. All of it.  Barring a contract, they can alter your pay going forward. They cannot retroactively change your pay for hours you've already worked. As for the shift scheduling, that's not a legal issue. If you want different shifts, ask.
