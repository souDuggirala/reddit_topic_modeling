 New York State, laid off last week due to company losing clients and being under financial strain. I had been working there for 2 years and received no severance. My employer did not give me my last paycheck, about $500 for the days I worked since my last direct deposit. Employer doesnâ€™t answer my calls. Are my next steps contacting the Department of Labor? Getting an attorney? Filing through small claims court? TL;DR: laid off due to budget cuts, company never paid me for the last days I worked. What legal action do I need to take to get my last paycheck? Department of Labor
