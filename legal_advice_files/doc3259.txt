 Can she fight this claim? The only possibility we can think of is that she was drugged at the bar. She has been looking forward to this job and itâ€™s really screwed her up. I have know this person most of her life and I know for a fact she has not touched a drug and looks down on them. The only other thing is maybe they mixed up the drug screenings. Is there anything she can do?  Shes screwed, you have no legal recourse for a pre employment test. Can probably ask for a retest out of her own pocket, especially if they send out an adverse action letter It isnt even a false positive, it is a positive positive.  This is true, if she believes it was a false positive she can ask for a retest. Thing is, she will most likely have to pay for it, and they use the same specimen.  Does she like poppy seed bagels? They can sometimes cause a false positive. Or she didn't disclose a legal medication that she takes, that false-positives for some controlled drug. There are a lot of over the counter drugs that can false-positive. Even some bagels can cause false positives. Sometimes false positive do happen so they might be able to do a second test
