 My gf was sold a car by a family friend for fairly cheap, paid for it in cash, the seller kept a copy of the registration and put my gfs info on it (name/address), we needed money so decided to resell the vehicle for more money online, we forged a bill of sale(stupid, I know) from the original owner to the new buyer and didn’t get a copy of the bill of sale (very stupid, I know). Now the problem is the new guy must not have registered it in his name, got a ticket in said car, it was sent to the family friend so he went to DMV and showed his copy of registration saying it was sold to my gf and DMV said they’d take care of it for him. If a ticket from this guy shows up at our doorstep what should I do?  You committed multiple crimes and should contact an attorney if anything about this ever comes up.
