 /r/legaladvice some help would be appreciated. My car was towed due to expired registration late last night (Friday) past Motor vehicle operation hours. I went to the DMV today, renewed my registration but It turns out the police station release is closed until Monday meaning I can’t get my car out the tow lot thus being charged for additional days where I have no control over. Is there anything I can do? I have medical bills piling up and I can’t afford tow yard lot bills as well. I tried calling the tow lot but all I got was an asshole berating me over my expired registration, saying it’s not their problem I’m located in New Jersey.  Sorry just the way it is. Side note, my car was improperly towed once, I went to the tow yard to get it back and he said he don't open for another 30 minutes. Me being mad and stuff, used my remote start to start the car in their garage, making noise and exhaust. He opened early for me. The asshole is right - it's not their problem.  That's the point. It's punishment
