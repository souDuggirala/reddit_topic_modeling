 Paid $450 to my university ski club for tickets, lodging, and bus fare. During the bus ride, the backpack containing my laptop was somehow placed on a seat at the front of the bus instead of the stowaway under the bus. At some point during the 6 hour trip, the backpack fell off of the seat, and when I opened the laptop, half of the screen was a complete mess due to some damage at the bottom of the monitor. Any advice is greatly appreciated  Thatâ€™s what I was thinking. The only blurry part is that fact that it was removed from the stowaway by someone other than myself. Am I responsible for that as well? I don't see how anyone besides yourself would be responsible for that. if you had a laptop in your bag you should have kept it with you.
