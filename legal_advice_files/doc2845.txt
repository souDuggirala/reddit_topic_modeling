 I know companies don't legally have to give vacation. When I took my job offer the letter included salary and 2 weeks vacation. I was not told that one of these weeks is a specific shutdown week in July. I would have negotiated a different offer if I knew. I don't care if I'm paid for this July week. I want time off to go to out of town family events like weddings and retirements. They are very hesitant to give me any unpaid time off. I'm not at the point of considering legal action but I would like to know if there is a legal issue here I can cite. I'm not sure the company is legally obligated to disclose that in a job offer. But shouldn't that be disclosed in a job offer? I feel like the offer wasn't in good faith. No legal issue at all. Your employer is free to force you to use PTO, even in the case where they force you to not come to work.
