 A few weeks ago, I let an acquaintance move into my guest bedroom for an unspecified short term. Our living situation has become untenable due to his inability to maintain boundaries (for example - he rearranges my cabinets and closets and secretly washed my slippers and shoes?!) Considering he has lived with me for less than a month, do I need to give him a full 30 days notice to get out of my house? Refunding someone's entire rent would be a very reasonable "cash for keys" agreement. Ideally you would have the agreement in writing, but a canceled check is at least proof that a payment of some kind was made. Shucks. I already gave him a check repaying what heâ€™s given me so far in an attempt to end the agreement politely.  Yes, you must give him notice to end his tenancy, just like you would any other tenant. Without a specified term in writing (like week-by-week), all tenancies at will default to being month-to-month. A tenant can agree to waive that right to notice as part of a "cash for keys" arrangement where you pay them to break the lease. Get it in writing.
