 I purchased an Apple Watch 6 months ago from Offerup, and today a detective contacted me saying that the watch was stolen and he wants my offerup account to find out who sold it to me. He threatened to come to my house with a search warrant if I did not give it to him. He is located in Oregon, and I live right next door in Washington. I did verify that he is a legitimate detective, but I am not sure how to proceed. The back story is that I purchased a bike before on offerup and ended up selling it on eBay, and it turned out that it was stolen. A different police officer tried to harass me then, but I proved that I did not know it was stolen, and he left me alone for a while. Now the new detective brought that up, and is saying that I am a criminal. Should I be scared, or is it just a scare tactic? They don’t want the watch back, they just want my account info You have no right to stolen property. You have to surrender it. That's up to whatever judge they talk to. It's possible. Seems unlikely to me though. I advise you to simply lawyer up that’s always the best advice I can give anyone. Looking things up on google and stuff isn’t as effective as having a lawyer. Also in the event that they actually try to scare tactic you and bring you in or anything like that the lawyer can be a massive help. If you don’t have the funds for that you can perhaps ask for a consultation ?  I don’t plan to talk to them. Can they execute a search warrant at my house for this? The detective threatened to get a search warrant Unknowingly buying stole property is not a crime. Do not talk to the officer or admit anything unless you’re summoned or a warrant is given to seize the watch.
