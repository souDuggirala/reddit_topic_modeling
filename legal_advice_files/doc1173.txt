 Or will they be arrested? Will the judge rule in the favor of the parent with a clean record?  I actually did something similar with the person my wife was having an affair with. Found out where he had a felony VOP hearing at and alerted that county's Sheriff as they were trying to serve him a protection order that he was avoiding. They coordinated with the county the hearing is in and went off without a hitch. OP, you need to contact whatever county has the warrant and give them all the details so they can verify it, they will forward the warrant. Thank so much this makes me feel a lot better. Nothing is happening yet but I feel as if itâ€™s going in that direction.. Yeah, definitely. It shows that he is violent. You should get a lawyer or at least get a free/low cost consultation. Google YOURSTATE bar association and they will be able to direct you to a lawyer that can help. So this person, in another state, has a DV related restraining order that was granted..he broke it. Would this help me at all if this happens to go to court?  They may not check to see if he has any warrants. If I were in that situation, I would probably contact the clerk of court in the county where his warrant is and let them know that he will be present at COURTHOUSE ADDRESS on DATE at TIME just in case they want to swing by and talk to him.
