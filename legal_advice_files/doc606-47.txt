Hi. My ex and I recently broke up we had been together for a few years. During the last few months he fell on to hard times and had to borrow quite a lot of money from me. I am a waitress and don’t make a ton of money but I was on my grind this summer and from June to October I loaned him around $22,000. This summer was rocky, he was borrowing so much money from me I could barely stay afloat. He was manipulative and really good at making me feel guilty for him so I stayed loaning even though I know it wasn’t smart. We have now broken up, the money tension was a factor in the reason but not the main reason by any means. However he claims that he has no intention to pay me back if we are not together. The majority of money was sent via etransfer so I have records of it, I also have a few messages from him promising these payments are a loan and that as soon as he gets himself together he will pay me back. I’m wondering if I have any grounds for legal action? I feel stupid for giving him so much, but like I said I don’t make a lot of money in my career and I’m having a really hard time financially now. Is there anything I can do? Or is it best to just cut my losses and move on with my life? Thank you in advance for any help offered. I feel so stupid for getting myself into this situation Thank you for the info I appreciate it. Definitely learned my lesson  Just a couple text messages of him promising to pay me back and then some. Nothing official  Was there any kind of paper agreement, or oral agreement that anyone else heard you make? If not, this is a series of unsecured loans Your location is going to matter a lot here. In most places 22k is not small claims court territory which means you would need to go to big boy court which requires an attorney. And then even if you win there is no guarantee you will collect. This may end up being a life lesson not to let yourself be leeched upon by deadbeat boyfriends.
