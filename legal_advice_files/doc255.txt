 Throw away because reasons. I hit a mailbox, panicked and fled the scene. I know, I know it was stupid and I should’ve stopped. I was planning on going back in the morning with cash for the mailbox once I’d calmed down but a police officer showed up at my door. I didn’t admit to hitting the mailbox however, my license plate came off so he obviously knew it was me. He told me he would send me a citation in the mail and I would need to go to court for a hit and run. However, I obtained a copy of the police report through the department website online and he did not check off the box stating I committed a hit in run nor does it say anything about fleeing the scene in his notes. It’s my first offense and my driving record is clean, not even a speeding ticket. So I guess what I’m asking is how likely is it that I will be charged? Could he have lied about charging me with a hit and run?  The citation will lay out the offenses you are listed as violating. When that comes in, you should consult with a traffic attorney.
