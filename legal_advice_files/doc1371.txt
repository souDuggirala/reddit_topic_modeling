 I got a package about 3 months ago that was addressed to my address, but a different name. It was from FedEx and it had a phone number on the front which I’ve tried to reach with no luck. I kind of forgot about it until today and figured I’d see what was inside in case there was other info so I could figure out who to return it to. Well, it looks to be a semi-expensive piece of jewelry, but no additional info to contact the intended recipient. I know I could send it back to the company it was ordered from, but aside from probably being morally wrong, if I were to sell it, would that be illegal? Obviously, yes. Completely illegal to sell something that does not belong to you. Yes, very much so. Opening it was illegal too.
