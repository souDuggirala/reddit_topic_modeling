 He’s 3.5 years old, I just had him neutered about three weeks ago. Now I’m at the emergency vet and they’re currently figuring out what’s wrong with him. They say he’s in critical condition and will most likely need to be put down. What if it was due to the surgery? What can we do?  You’ll have to have a necropsy done to determine cause of death first. You’ll also need all of his vet records. Did you have bloodwork done before anesthesia? It could have been a reaction to the anesthetic which is beyond anyone’s control, or it could have been negligence which will require more investigation. Sorry for your loss though. I know how much it hurts. Not much from a neuter itself could cause your dog to die 3 weeks later. Pretty much the only possible relation with the procedure could be severe hypotension during anesthesia that caused renal failure or severe post-op infection. But even if it is the case, most likely this is a random event that your vet probably couldn't see coming or realistically prevent. It's unlikely that you have a case against your vet unless they were extremely negligent in their anesthesia monitoring or surgical practice. But first thing first, you need a diagnosis for what your dog has. You can't go anywhere until you have a definite diagnosis.  You may want to try posting on r/askvet they maybe could help you determine if this is even a possibility. Sorry I’m on mobile  Not sure on what to do but hope doggo is ok
