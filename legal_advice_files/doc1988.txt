 Iâ€™m moving to Florida from Texas in a month. The vehicle I currently drive is in my fathers name and I am still paying down the loan. It is insured by the state of Texas by him and I am listed as the driver. Moving to Florida I need to be able to register and insure the car in my name, would a POA need to be filed for the state of Texas or for Florida for me to drive the vehicle? Thanks  The vehicle needs to be registered in your name in order for you to insure it. You can't insure something you dont own
