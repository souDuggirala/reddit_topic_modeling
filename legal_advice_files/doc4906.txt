 Forgive me if this is a dumb question, I simply can not find the answer. Its snowing this morning here in New Hampshire, and on my way to work I slid off the road and hit something with the front passenger side panel, next to the headlight. My turn signal in the headlight mount still functions, but the secondary signal on the side of the car does not. Is the secondary signal a requirement to be legally on the road even though the one up front still functions? Thanks. That's your answer. Signals is plural, so one not working could be ticket worthy. All I've been able to find is requirements for passing vehicle inspection, which basically just says working turn signals.  The local DMV doesn't have vehicle requirements for being road-worthy listed on the website?
