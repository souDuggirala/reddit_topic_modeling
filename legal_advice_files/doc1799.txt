 Sorry if this is too nonspecific or confusing for real advice but its the best I can do My friend 17 is seeking to be removed from her household and BF or my house, she has 3 months til turns 18. We are currently exploring options for her to legally terminate her parent's custodial rights or have them transferred to a more fit guardian. Her parents are alcoholics whom are severely psychologically abusive towards her and create an extremely toxic environment for her, in addition, they have failed to get her proper medical care for some wounds and injuries such as a problem with her ear that has cost 90% of her right ear hearing. So my Question is would a Petition for custody or notifying CPS be the best course of action (or a third option i failed to notice like some form of protective emancipation.) We are not looking to fully complete the process, we are just looking to separate her from her parents until the time that she turns 18, and from what I read she can file for protective orders if It can be argued that she is or could be in danger from her parents during the proceedings  None of that is worth the time and effort, nothing will be resolved before she turns 18. She can just not go home and lay low til her birthday.  She can report it to CPS but it's unlikely to resolve anything before she turns 18. Same with emancipation if she even qualified, which is doesn't sound like she does. Realistically, unless she's in physical danger, waiting it out for three more months is probably the way to go. Call CPS Emancipation?
