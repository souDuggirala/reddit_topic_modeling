 So last week, on literally my second day at my new job, I slipped on ice getting out of my car, fell, and broke two bones in my leg. 4 days in the hospital, a metal rod down the middle of my tibia, and I just got home Saturday. My work has been great about everything and making sure I’m taken care of. I had insurance from day one. I fainted from the pain of the fall, but I also managed to shatter my Apple Watch. I know workers comp will be taking care of all the medical, but is there anyway to get my watch replaced or fixed? I used it a lot in my daily life, and now would be a really good safety tool, while I’m so injured.  Did you have personal insurance coverage on it? Such as maybe they your renter’s insurance? You could try to contact the policy holder or maybe you have device protection the AppleCare or the cell carrier.
