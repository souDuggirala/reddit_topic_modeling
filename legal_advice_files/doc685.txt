 I took my University's logo (their name as text) and edited it to spell a different word for parodies sake. What is the legality of me making a website and selling the item as a sticker or mug? It is slightly insulting to the school, but is in no way hate speech or anything, just a cheeky joke.  I really can't say whether it would put a target on your back. It depends on your school and their sense of humor. Using your Perdoo example... I know it's seemingly silly and small and not a big deal. But, if I'm on the Board at Perdue and I see this, I probably want to take any and all action necessary to make sure "Perdoo" doesn't itself become more recognizable than "Perdue." And I don't want "Perdue" to become immediately associated with "Perdoo," either. But again, if I were you, before doing anything, I'd find a local copyright/trademark atty.  thank you very much for the advice, would any use of their logo effectively put a target on my back? I guess an example of what I would be doing would be like taking Perdue and making it Perdoo. my goal isn't to make money, but it's a solid, funny design and i would like to distribute it.  More likely than not, you'd be fine. But I wouldn't recommend it. First off, legal issues aside, I can tell you from first-hand experience that it's not the best idea to make enemies with your school before you graduate. Second, even if you're in the clear (legally), that wouldn't stop your school from at least trying to initiate legal action. They have more resources than you and they may be willing to spend the money to make you stop. So, weigh the pros and cons on this one. What's it worth to you? If you're seriously considering going ahead anyway, I advise you to contact a copyright/trademark lawyer and pay for a consultation with him ahead of time. If your whole goal is to make money, then you should make part of your initial investment in obtaining legal counsel.
