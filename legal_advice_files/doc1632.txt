 [GA] Previous employer has been taking tips from employees illegally. Another coworker has already filed a report, and an investigation is likely to be done. I sign a contract that said I confirmed receiving a check from the employer of “corrected tip”, which is the supposed remaining tip money from the time I worked there. Said contract also has me confirm that I “am not owed any money for unpaid work hours or overtime.” One coworker that was involved in reporting the problem said he didn’t sign, rejecting his check and waiting for the investigation to be done. If it turns out my old employer owes me more than what I was given in the check I signed for, did I sign away my shot at getting the rest of it? Or am I still legally due the money? I can give the contract word for word, as it is a VERY short statement.
