 I have a website that shows movies from other websites. I'm sure, for those websites I get the content from, it's illegal to host these movies on their servers. I'm just using their source. Is that illegal in the US? If it is, is there a country where it's not? Is that even relevant? The US has precedence for seeking extradition on the basis of copyright infringement. Is this legal where you are located?  Yes, of course thatâ€™s illegal
