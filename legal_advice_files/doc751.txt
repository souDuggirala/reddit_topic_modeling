 So at my work they contact us through our personal phone. For anything work related stuff during and outside of work. This includes texts and calls. And I know my supervisors get there phone bills paid by the company and I'm tired of the calls and texts during and off my work. We have a company phone we use during work but we have 2 or 3 people scheduled to work and the other people have to use their phone. For GPS and other things. I was thinking of telling my boss and supervisors to stop texting and calling me on my personal phone for work related stuff unless they're willing to pay for my phone bill. I live in California.  []() I understand that California law requires employers to reimburse employees for business expenses, and there is some case law indicating this includes usage of personal cell phones. Of course you can tell your employer off. Just don't be surprised when you get fired.  That's what I am planning on doing. Still going to change my number. And give them a Google voice number.  You can tell them. They can fire you. If you are hourly, you should be compensated if you spend time on work stuff after hours. You could get a cheap prepaid or a Google Voice and give that number to your managers. I'll just stop replying to there messages or get a new number all together.  You can tell them whatever you want, but they can respond however they want as well. If it's excessive to the point of harassment, that's a different matter. If they're taking time out of your day with the calls and texts after hours, you might have a case for a compensation increase, but there's nothing in the legal realm here.
