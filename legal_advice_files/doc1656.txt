  I booked a vacation last spring and the company went under at the end of the summer last year. After doing my due diligence to get my money back I received a temporary refund from my bank in October, I thought the situation was over with. I now just recently received a letter from my bank stating that the vendor has provided a rebuttal which includes documentation (a receipt). My bank now requests that I provide "Description of specific services not provided by the merchant. Proof that merchant has gone out of business." I'm not sure how or what I need to get to show proof that this company went out of business. I'm also coming up on the deadline to file claims with TICO (Travel Industry Council of Ontario) which is on February 11th. I have already tried to get a refund from TICO and they advised me to receive my refund from my bank and if my bank refused, to get that refusal in writing and then send it to them and then they would refund me. This is an absolute fiasco. I have been keeping track of everything, I've copied all documents and conversations had with TICO and my bank. So I guess what I'm asking is how can I get proof that this company went under?
