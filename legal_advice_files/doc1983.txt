 In the beginning if 2018, my company moved from paper stubs to online stubs if you have direct deposit. Well, with the 2018 tax season coming up, I thought it would be a good idea to login and start compiling financial data. Long story short, I tried logging into my account and the account got locked. I cannot change my password or get access to the account because it is locked. The website keeps saying, "Contact your System administrator." I have no idea what this means. I keep asking my boss what I should do and she's just as confused as everyone else. On a side note, I called the company that runs the website and they said that they couldn't help me and that they only deal with changing addresses on W2's. The lady on the phone then gave me an 800 number that was supposedly for dealing with login issues such as mine. I called the number and it was a SCAM number saying something about "enter your credit card info to redeem $100 worth of retail credit." This new company that my job has setup to handle W2's and pay stubs is an absolute joke. I'm so offended by the sheer lack of communication and ease of access. Is there a government agency that I can call to complain to? Or will I have to hire a lawyer to help me get the financial documents that I need for the upcoming tax season? Contacted HR...no response yet. Staying diligent and trying to get through.  Have you contacted the payroll or HR department? Who would you ask with questions on your pay or benefits? There was an option to choose online-only W2's only and I'm not sure if I chose that option or not. W2 aren't required to be mailed until Jan 31st. IRS isn't accepting taxes for weeks. Relax
