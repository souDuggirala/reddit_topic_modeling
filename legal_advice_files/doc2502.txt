 Sorry in advanced, Im on mobie with a finicky keyboard. I know someone who was arrested for a thing and got out of bail. Now theyre adding a charge and may possibly take the person back into custody. They're not getting charged for a whole new crime, but more has come out about the original crime (I dont know if that makes a difference). I tried looking it up online but the answers were generic, saying things could differ per state. But I did see that if a person goes back into custody, the bail paid so far could be lost. They didnt specify though if it made any difference weather that new charge was from a competely seperate incidents (like a guy dealt drugs, got out on bail, then robbed a store) or if they were just new chargeds added to one event (i cant think of a good random exmple for this so here is a bad one: dude robs a store and during evidance gathering they find out he was threatening the attendent with a knife, which they didnt know when he got out on bail) Currently this person is likely going to go back to jail, so Im wondering if the original bailed paid will be returned, since they will have custody of them at that point, or if its possible that the money paid just vets lost to some void as I read. Sorry #2 if this is rambly or scatterbrained, but I just found out about this a half hour ago and I would to ha e some idea before court which is coming up.
