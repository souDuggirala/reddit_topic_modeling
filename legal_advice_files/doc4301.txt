 So 4 or so years ago I got a misdemeanor DUI in Oregon. A few months later after starting payments and my classes I left to Nebraska. No real family there and needed a change. Fast forward to now, I’m in NE and doing great. 2 1/2 years sober, supervisor at my job, and all that stuff. Now the only thing holding me back is getting my legal stuff taken care of. I have been in contact with the courts regarding my fine, and that is all taken care of. Now where I am stuck is how I go about asking for my probation to get moved here too NE. I really want my license back and I’m sure I have to be in probation again/still since I just left. Any insight or help is great, just trying every avenue of getting it together. Yes but it’s a misdemeanor warrant and nothing can be done. What type of probation were you on? Did you inform anyone of your change of address? If not, your best bet may be to contact an attorney back in Oregon to find out the best way to proceed.  You'll probably want the assistance of a criminal defense attorney in Oregon. There is a very high chance that there is a warrant for your arrest.
