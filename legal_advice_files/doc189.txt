 Unless you can prove that your neighbor had prior knowledge that the tree was dead/diseased then it is in Act of God territory. I would get with your neighbors and see about splitting the cost of the clean up and hiring a tree service to do it, or just hire one to clean up your own yard. That way you don't risk causing damage to your neighbor's house when you try and do it yourself.
