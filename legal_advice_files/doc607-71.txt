I have contacted Mylife 5 times now, asking them to remove my information from their website.  I have also told them each time that they do not have my permission to display my private information on their website, nor do they have the right to charge people who may want to run a background check on me and get sensitive information about me.  What can I do?  Can I do a lawsuit against this website?  I want them to stop displaying my information and stop profiting from my information.   I don't what to do, because they keep putting my information back up. [deleted] Those are not private information.  That isn't private information. If you have registered to vote, your name and the associated address are public. If you have a land phone line, unless you pay extra to be unlisted, that phone number and address are public. If other people make posts about you that are factual and are not the sort of thing that a reasonable person would find offensive (read things like you having an STD) the first amendment protects the right to publish factual information. Your attempts to lead a private life are irrelevant when it comes to the freedom of press/speech which allows for the publication of factually accurate information.  If you don’t like it move to Europe. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Most, if not all, of this information is accumulated from PUBLIC records, not your private information. Your name, address, and even phone number are not “private” information. In fact, it sued to be common place that I would get a book with such information for my entire city in it every year, these books were in pay phone booths as well! Nor is it private to see who you are connected with through public records such as voting registration.  They are free to charge whoever is willing to pay them for whatever information they have compiled on you. You cannot do anything. What private information is on their website? Where are you located?
