I dropped off my computer at a computer repair place. They called to tell me it was ready. I arrived within their business hours to find it closed. I have since returned every day for three weeks at varying times to always find it closed. Now the phone line is disconnected.
 
I'm worried they have gone out of business and I don't know what to do. Is there anything I can do to get my stuff back? Sue them in small claims for the value of the computer. 
 
Find the legal name of the company, have the local town clerk locate the business license and serve the owner(s). Also might be on the Division of corporations.
