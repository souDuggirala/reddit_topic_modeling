 My girlfriend’s grandmother (let’s call her Shirley) has been in an online “relationship” with a “gentleman” she met on the dating site “plenty of fish” and he has convinced her to send him many transfers of increasing amounts, for various reasons. She is unwilling to believe she is getting scammed and trusts this man dearly. She has never met him and insists she speaks with him on FaceTime. She is currently in the hospital recovering from heart failure. She is not in her right mind currently as she attempted to leave the hospital, getting angry when we told her we needed to hear from the doctor in regards to her condition. The doctor informed us that Shirley is medically unfit to leave and would be detained should she try to leave. My girlfriend has power of attorney over Shirley and is the executor of her will. We are considering contacting Shirley’s lawyer as a next step and get professional advice about the situation but this is very unfamiliar territory for us both and could use any insights possible. We are unsure of any care that would need to be provided for her and how she is doing financially after giving away all this money (a significant amount of her life savings). We believe she is not making competent decisions, and has even circumvented the banks protocol when she was stopped from transferring funds on one occasion. Shirley will need any and all money she has for in home care and we need to make sure she doesn’t lose any more, and investigate any avenues for the lost funds. Any help or advice about our options would be very appreciated. In addition to the above, contact the police and see if they can’t catch this scam artist who is stealing her blind. You need to consult with a lawyer on how to get the bank to stop allowing her access to the account. It may require a court order - perhaps appointment of a guardian. Talk to a lawyer ASAP.  The money she sent is gone. Probably in Nigeria at this point.
