 Hello, I’m a small business owner of a salon. My store provide hot stone massages to clients, and recently a customer came in with a complaint that she sustained an injury a few months prior when she got a hot stone massage by one of my employee. I was told that her lawyer will be contacting me in a few days. This is the first time that this has happened, so I’m seeking advice on how I should proceed. I’m located in Manitoba, Canada. Personal injury lawsuits are relatively rare in Canada, particularly when compared to a country like the United States. In order for someone to successfully sue you, they need to have lost money. Since it doesn't cost anything to see a doctor here, your client probably doesn't have any medical bills. Unless her injury was so severe that it's caused her to miss work, in which case you'd probably already know about the injury, chances are your client doesn't have a case. Additionally, any good lawyer would tell their client not to contact the person they are suing, and to let the lawyer do all the work. It is possible this person is trying to scam you and does not even have a lawyer. Suggestions: 1) Have your employee (or employees if the client dealt with more than one) write down everything they can remember about their interactions with the client. 2) Don't give the client any money. If she says "ya, I won't sue if you give me $500" you have no guarantee she won't take the money and come back next week and ask for $1000. 3) If served with a lawsuit, contact your liability insurance provider and make them deal with it.  You have insurance right? If you are contacted by a lawyer or sued hand it over to the insurance company to handle.
