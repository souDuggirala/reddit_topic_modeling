 I got the offer around September 2018. It was a perfect role for me. Closer to November/December time, I heard nothing so enquired and was told we've pushed it to March. I was pissed but I could accept it. So it's approaching March soon and I heard nothing again, so enquired and they said we've pushed it to either July or September 2019. So they've pretty much made me wait a year for my job. Surely this is illegal? I've had a side job but I feel I could have progressed so much more in my career if they had either took me on when they initially promised, or just been honest with me from the beginning so I could apply somewhere else. I have a friend working there and apparently they're having financial difficulties due to brexit uncertainty which I can totally understand but they shouldn't be messing with the livelihoods of people just because they're not making an extra buck or two. Any advice? Do I send a strongly worded email or should I go Saul Goodman on their ass?  r/LegalAdviceUK would be a better suited sub to answer this. Well, we would need a little more info. Did you sign an offer letter with an expected start date - or range of dates? Did you receive an email with the start date agreement? You may want to talk to a labor lawyer. It does sound like you shouldâ€™ve kept looking once they gave you the runaround for a little while. I am not sure they did anything illegal.
