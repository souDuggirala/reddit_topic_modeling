 I live in Hartford CT and I live in an apartment. The gas stove in the apartment has been leaking gas since it was “installed” on 02/06. I have verbally notified the landlord multiple times since that date, I have not submitted anything in writing and am about to do so. He continuously tells me “oh I’ll get it done tomorrow” or “I’ll have someone come by to look at it” Every time I enter my kitchen the constant smell of gas is making me want to vomit. It’s even worse because I have a wife and infant at home all day. What should I do? First off...Hey from Hartford! Call cng first ( or whoever ) and tell them you smell gas. They will send someone out asap to shut off the gas and check it out. Then notify the landlord. I am absolutely no expert, but especially at this time of year, I believe you need to have heat in your residence. It is just for cooking? Or heat as well. If it is heat, your landlord will have to get it fixed asap once its shut off. If there is gas leaking, you should not be in the home. Call the fire department to come inspect, they can safely shut off the gas to the stove until the landlord can remedy your issue. He will likely move a lot quicker knowing the fire department had to visit, especially if they deem it unfit.  Give written notice next time and keep records
