So if i walk into a local, small town gas station and they have a sign that says “must spend over 5$ to use debit/credit”..... is that illegal? do I have every right to make them look like a fool if they have that sign up just because I can and I have legal backing? or am I completely wrong and I shouldn’t have even asked this question in the first place?  [deleted] From the bottom of my heart. Fuck you for desiring to make a scene where I work just cause you don’t want to spend the money.

Seriously gfy. [deleted] It's not illegal, but it may violate the merchant agreement with their credit card processor. 

Either way though, all you can do is complain to Visa and Mastercard.
