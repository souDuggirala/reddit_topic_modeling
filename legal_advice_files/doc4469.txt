 Follow up question: if the products cost $100 to make and I charge $200 (net profit $100) would I claim $100 or $200 earned on my taxes if I am claiming those as a part of my income? Thanks! All sales of goods, are just that sales. You can't deduct sales because of who you sold to. If you wanted a deduction, then you would have had to make a donation and you could list the cost of the goods on your taxes as a donation - there are limits to this of course. For income statement: Sales $200 COGS $100 Gross Profit $100  Not a Lawyer. You must claim all business you do on your taxes, regardless of who it is with.
