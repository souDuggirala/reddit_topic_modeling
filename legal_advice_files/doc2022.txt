 I have concrete evidence that guards at a penitentiary will a) turn a blind eye to drug use and b) supply said drugs to Inmates. Both all for the right price. What federal agency would I report this to. I absolutely under no circumstances want to approach the leadership at said penitentiary. Just looking for what official gov't body this concerns so I can contact them directly and skip the middleman. If a federal institution, you can make your report to the Bureau of Prisons. If otherwise you should report to that agency.
