 Considering buying a 5 acre plot of land to build a home in a neighborhood with 1/2 an acre being a large drainage ditch for the neighborhood. According to the seller/builder, the town would be liable for maintaining the drainage and keeping it in working order. The town would also be liable for any flood damage or performance issues. This will all be somehow in writing on the title of the home. According to my insurance company, if I own the land the easement is on I own the liability and they aren’t sure if they want to cover it. If a kid rides a bike into it and is hurt or if a toddler drowns, I’m liable since I own the land. They wanted me to fence off the entire 1/2 acre. Any experience or advice with this? If it were a gas line easement and it exploded the homeowner wouldn’t be liable so this seems ridiculous.
