I worked for a small company.   


The company steals user names and passwords from employees. 

The company hacks private emails, and steals nude photos. 

The company is family to local law enforcement. 

I have concrete evidence the company hacked my accounts and stole data from me.

The cops say that isn't probable cause to investigate for the other crimes I witnessed. 

That seems like a problem.  I have the data logs of their ip address accessing my info without my permission  This is not concrete evidence.  They bragged about it. Admitting everything. Tried to frame me for their crimes.  [deleted] What is the concrete evidence you have that shows they hacked you? OP, have you ever sat down with a mental health professional?   I’ve contacted the fbi. They either think I’m making it up, or don’t have the time. They are not investigating. Fbi said go to Arvada. Arvada doesn’t know cyber crime. Arvada investigated a cell phone the evidence is on the web servers where they don’t know how to look. I don’t know how to get the correct cops to look at it. If they are getting nude photos of minors contact the FBI as this is child pornography  All the time  They had employee management software or key logger. I don’t know. I know they get the user names and passwords and try them all over the internet. They target young girls. 16-17 yo.  their iCloud passwords are the same as their email passwords.  I'm sorry, how did they get your password just by you sending an email? Change your passwords.  I needed a job. I didn’t know they were criminals  They made you send them an email from your private account on company computer during hiring. 
Edit : Arvada Colorado  How are they stealing your passwords? Did they install a keylogger on their computer you were using? Why do you work for this company?
