 I was contracted to do a small advertising job. They had me sign a W-9 tax form and send in my direct deposit information. I had worked on a project with someone who was also mentoring me. After a couple of weeks through the project we had done quite a bit of work (the project being creating a booklet for company use through Adobe Illustrator). Afterwards the CEO said we still had work to do before it was finished and wanted minor changes. A couple of weeks later my mentor went on to another job and I was left alone on the job. That said, things lost traction and the project seemed to have fallen apart and I then went back to focusing on my part time job and school. A month or so later, one of the higher ups in the organization asked if he could use what I had so far. I sent him the material. Do I have legal rights to payment? I would assume I do. It was supposed to be a recruiting booklet for a pest control company. They’re using the pages I helped create to go recruit. Though it’s all PDF instead of a tangible book. What was your contract for? Typically contracts are for the completion of a task or project. It appears that you may have abandoned the work and never finished. If it was a time and material contract - you should get paid. If it was for a fixed fee to accomplish a task - you should not.
