 My luggage was lost on 9/17/18 when flying from Detroit to London with a layover in Iceland. I did not have travel insurance. It has been a long grueling process, but I finally got the airline to agree to pay me $1570 for the lost bag. They told me the money would be wired to my account by 1/30/19. That day came and passed with no progress. I contacted the airline baggage support on 1/31/19 and they told me that the payment was delayed due to unforeseen circumstances and that they could not provide any further details. At a loss and looking for advice on next steps.
