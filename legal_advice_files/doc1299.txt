 (Seattle, WA) Why would an eviction against me take place in 2013 when I resided and left (on good terms) in 2009? No eviction notice or late payment was ever given to me. Could it possibly be some error done with a computer? Maybe someone was evicted at that apartment, and they (property management, landlord) mindlessly used my name when filing for the court paperwork?  I'm thinking this as well. Ownership of building did change after I moved out. So I heard. Track down original landlord that is. Also, she keeps ignoring my question when I ask for previous and current landlord. Can't tell if she's spacey or purposefully trying to hide info. I can't track down the landlord, but I have been keeping contact with their incompetent manager. She says she can't even find me in their system as being a resident. I think she may just not know how to find this info or some data has been lost in their system. Last thing she told me is that she is searching through archives. This was days ago. Call the landlord or management up and ask about it. I did have a roommate, but we both left that place on the same day. Gave a proper 20 day notice when lease was about to end.  Did you have a roommate who stayed when you moved out? Probably some sort of recordkeeping error. You cannot be evicted from a property where you aren't a tenant at the time.
