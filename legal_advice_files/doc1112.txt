 So theres this little sketchy looking place by me that rents out empty rooms that people can use as a music studio or whatever they want. A group of my friends rented one of the rooms before I left for college and I had left a $200 guitar in there. While I'm in college, they had switched rooms and I was told that the owner told these guys that all property that was left in the room will remain in the room for the next people who rent it. I don't know if this was in any contract that they signed and I have yet to contact the owner about it, but apparently they had left a keyboard in there as well and he wouldn't allow them to get it. I never paid rent for the studio or signed any contract and I'm just wondering how this is legal if it's still my property? I would like to be prepared regarding the legality of this before I rage on this guy so I appreciate any advice you could give to me. I don't have the receipt but if I go to guitar center they might have it on record.  Itâ€™s not legal. Do you have proof of ownership?
