 I won’t get too specific but I have been in the market for a car recently and looking at all my options I recently found a [insert performance Luxor’s model] with under 10k listed for WELL below what it’s worth. Like an insane number that absolutely has to be a mistake. This is represented on the dealers website along with on the brands inventory on the main site associated with said brand. If I were to attempt to purchase the car for the listing price and turned down do I have any room for legal action to get the price listed?  Usually bait and switch practices are handled by the states consumer protection agencies or the attorney general's office. Retailers doing such things can be fined by the state. It is not a boon to consumers when they run across such things. You can simply report it to the state and let the punish the offender. Makes sense, I had see a story about a man who had a similar situation and was able to get the price in the listing but his was an actual attempt to bait and switch not an accidental listing so I understand the difference  No, you have no right to take advantage of a clerical error. More importantly, ads are generally viewed as an invitation for buyers to make an offer, not as an offer to sell, thus you cannot just show up at a dealership and say “I accept your offer to sell.”
