 This is NYC. My ex gf was subletting and got kicked out back in August with no opportunity to retrieve her stuff (besides her clothes which were thrown on the curb in boxes), including my piano she was borrowing, and tons of sheet music/materials essential to her job as a piano teacher. We've stopped bothering in the past few months after they blocked her. But today, I decided to text to see if they blocked me, and it turns out they didn't. Their response was "hahaha", with no further response regarding me retrieving my property. Should I just call the police at this point? How would I go about proving that the piano is mine? (It's a digital keyboard, not a giant acoustic piano) FWIW I still see my ex and we're friends, she just really doesn't feel like dealing with it because they're abusive towards her, but I'm starting to get pissed.
