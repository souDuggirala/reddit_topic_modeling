 My husband and I are separating, we have two vehicles, a truck that has both of our names on it, and a car with only his name on it. The truck is still being paid off, the car is owned. I would like him to give me the car and keep the truck he wanted, but he is refusing saying he owns both vehicles and I’ll need to use my minimal savings to buy a vehicle. The car was bought when we were married, I couldn’t get my name on the title because I wasn’t working at the time. Are vehicles considered martial property and needs to be split evenly? The tuck is worth far more than the car, with much less mileage. I’m willing to take my name off the truck title as well. We did not have a prenup or anything like that. Any advice is helpful, thank you!   Likely yes. But this is something to discuss with your attorney. If there are substantive disputes as to marital property (and likely even if there aren't) you'll want an attorney to ensure your divorce progresses the way it should.
