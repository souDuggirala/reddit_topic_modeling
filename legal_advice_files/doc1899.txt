 Was involved in an accident and there was a witness that saw the other driver pull out in front of me while i had the right of way. The Police report sides with me as well. Accident accured on december 13th 2018 and as of january 10th 2019 im still without a vehicle (its been 28 days without) the insurance provider of the other driver disputed liability because thier drivers statement didnt match mine (he lied) until the police report was obtained. They now agree thier driver was at fault and started the process. They didnt have adjusters in my area so they had me use an app to take pictures of my vehicle so they can asses damages before i take it an auto repair shop of my choice (which i was informed). My question is am i sol for costs of having to bum rides for the last 28 days? Just seems mest up that they took so long to get the process going and help me out when thier driver was at fault. Going forward my truck is going to lose value with a wreck on record, am i eligible for loss in value? When they tell me that they will pay the repair shop directly do i say no i want a settlement with these damages included? Or am i just screwed? Nobody was injured btw. Just looking for some guidance thanks You can be reimbursed for a rental vehicle or potentially taxi rides if you submit receipts. You can be reimbursed for inherent value loss. You will just need to determine the inherent value of your vehicle before the accident and after the accident (repaired). If you would rather have a pay out for the repairs rather than having the vehicle repaired, you will need to negotiate that with them.
