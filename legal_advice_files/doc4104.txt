 The ticket says “Notations: Right hand turn from the L-right lane; insurance card 11/2018”. “Local ordinance: 625 ILCS 5/3 707(a)” “Nature of offensive: Operating uninsured motor vehicle”. My insurance card said it expired two weeks ago and I forgot to put the new one on my car. My dad was in the process of sending me a copy of the update insurance via phone but the officer said too late he already wrote the ticket. No gaps in coverage, I just didn’t have the paper on me. Question 1.) The pamphlet he gave me says if you get pulled over for failure to provide proof of insurance, bring your insurance insurance info to the court house. But the ticket says “operating an uninsured vehicle”, so I’m not sure if that still applies to me since the ticket doesn’t physically say anything like “failure to show proof”. Reading the ordinance online says subsection (a) is a misdemeanor. So will this show up on a background check? The statute is here http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=062500050K3-707 Question 2,) I work M-F 9-5:30. The court house opens 8am and is 20 min away from work. Ticket says 8am. Is traffic court usually slow, is it first come first serve? I’m not sure if I should take off of work or let someone know I will be late.  You didn't have proof of insurance, which the officer recorded as an uninsured vehicle. Get proof of insurance for the time and date of the ticket (may require a letter from the insurance company), and go to the courthouse with your ticket and evidence in-hand. A traffic misdemeanor is not like a criminal misdemeanor. It will not show up on a criminal background check like a DUI would. Either way, when you resolve the ticket it will be removed from your record anyhow. Traffic Court is the wild west, we can't tell you how long you'll be there. Plan on taking a morning off of work for this.
