 so i have been working on a clothing company for about 2 years now and have been making sales and buliding my name. now i have been doing this all word of mouth and selling to friends and at parties. I have no LLC or any business documents attached to me.. \\ What happened is this kid went out and got an LLC with my brand name and added "ILL" to the front of my current name. is there any legal action i can take to get him off my name \\ He probably beat you to the punch, but depending on the name, the ILL might make it dissimilar enough you could register.  He’s in the same state. We went to the same school. He just saw what I was doing and realized I didn’t have any legal info holding me to the company name so he went and got an LLC with the name I use. no DBA either Eh not really. Did you register the name as a DBA? Is this kid located in the same state?
