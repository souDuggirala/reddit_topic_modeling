 A crime was committed against me while on the job, it's a current ongoing legal investigation. The perpetrator sent somebody to threaten a co-worker of mine at our place or employment and they told him to not get involved if he valued his family and career. The co-worker is too scared to file a police report and my boss is refusing to do anything about this. Any suggestions? No, I can’t imagine any scenario where, even if it turns out in your favor, it would be anything less than stressful (or the Latin word word for stressful: “fucking shitty”) I would consider reaching out to this lawyer to see what they can do, if you’d like to pursue this avenue. Maybe ask the lawyer about other options. If not, then I’d document it in as much detail as you possibly can, and email it to your lawyer and yourself, just for your files and as a record in case he does something like this again.  Louisiana. Yes I did. It wasn't an easy hearing for it though, it lasted over 4 and half hours and wasn't very much fun at all. I didn’t see where you live, but in many places this is called indirect communication (as opposed to direct communication from them to you), and can also be explicitly covered by a second protective order. Did you work with a lawyer to get your temporary order?  I tried to get one and was only able to get a temporary one and it's now expired. It wasn't the perpetrator of the original crime that threatened my co-worker, he sent one of his fellow thugs to do it. Do you have a protective order against the person? This incident could be a reason to support you getting one - an order for the person not to come to your work or communicate with your coworkers about you.  I did, the officer I spoke to told me that the co-worker would have to file a report for anything to be done about it unfortunately. I tried to talk to him and my boss to urge them this should absolutely be done but they won't budge. CALL THE POLICE.
