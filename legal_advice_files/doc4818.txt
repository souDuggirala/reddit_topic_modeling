 I remember using Omegle as a kid and you would constantly be getting strangers that would jerk off into the camera disregarding whoever was on the receiving end of it. Is it legal? Or do people just not really care enough to go after someone for it? I’m fairly certain it is illegal, but given the nature of the sight it’s just overlooked by the people doing it
