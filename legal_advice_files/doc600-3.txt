I was misled that a form I was completing at an event last year was for a free raffle (to win a stand at the following year event). The project I run is due to complete and I knew this at the time but was happy to pass a win onto my parent company etc.

A whole year passes and I receive a very large invoice for the event; turns out the form the sales lady had me complete was their booking form not raffle... She informed me it was for their raffle etc but turns out no... the company now says there 100% payment cancellation policy.

I never received any information on this 'booking' and they had a term in the booking form that said they would send this out to the company oraganiser via recorded post within the evaluation period. I did not get any form and the recorded post sent out was signed for by nooone who works for my company...

The ask really is; does a booking form count as a binding contract? Also; under false misrepresentation do I have any grounds to argue. My problem is that I dont have any evidence (of course). Lastly; that the form sent out never made its way to me.

Thoughts? I am thinking of just paying out of pocket myself as my project is ending. But its under 10 grand so Ill be wiped of my savings.
