 [Nevada] My mother got a letter today from her ex husband suing her for a painting. Their marriage ended 15 years ago. I wanted to know if there are any time limitations with going after assets after so long? No they are both aware it’s pretty valuable. If it’s not in the decree and wasn’t a hidden asset. Get it appraised before going to court. My guess it’s worth more than you think and he just found it out.  Not sure which exact rule would apply, but the general statute of limitations in Nevada for civil actions is 6 years, and that should apply even to distribution of assets in a divorce. I suppose if this was an asset your mother had hidden from her husband and he's suing relatively soon after learning about it, that might be different.  As you aren't a legal party to this and don't know all the details there's not much advice you can be given other than: help her get a consult with a lawyer. I don’t know for sure as I was not involved in their divorce. But the fact that he’s coming after it makes me believe he was probably supposed to end up with it and according to her he didn’t pay monies she was owed. If he was supposed to get it but didn’t are there time issues with suing for it after so long? Was she supposed to give him the painting in the divorce? If not, why does he believe he has a right to the painting?
