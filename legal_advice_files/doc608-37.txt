**Background**: my wife and I bought a house earlier this year in Chesapeake (Virginia) with our best friends, people we consider family.  Between us, we have enough kids to go over the five person limit spoken about above.

When we bought the house, we sought the opinion of a lawyer, who talked about tenancy in common, along with other forms of co-owning a house.  Never was city code of family size brought up.

All four adults are on the title as co-owning the home.

**Today**: When checking the mail, I discovered that someone, most likely a neighbor, had printed off the quoted text above from the Chesapeake city code and left it for us to find.  It may also have been the mailman, but I somehow doubt that.  

**Next**: What are the possible ramifications from this?  If someone decides that us living in the house together is an issue and files a complaint with the city, what might happen to us?  Can the city seriously tell us that two of us have to depart the property, just because there are enough kids to go over the legal limit? Oh, it's definitely large enough. We spent months rejecting house after house due to size and layout.

Ours is two story, with five listed bedrooms and the formal dining room now converted (with the addition of doors) into a sixth bedroom, since the other husband has sleeping issues.  Question for you, (May sound rhetorical) is the home large enough for two families? What is the layout of the house i.e. single story or multi-story? The city can choose to enforce the ordinance by whatever means are appropriate/approved. My bet would be that you might incur a fine for having too many non-related persons in the house.
