 This applies to Alexandria, Virginia. God forbid, if anything were to happen to us - I am just curious...does she have the right to just throw me out the night of and move my stuff without consent? I am not on an official lease, but I did try and do my due diligence by getting something in writing stating I live here and she had signed it a while back. I keep it in my wallet just in case. Does this do me any justice at all? Thanks I'm not sure of the specific legalities of your area but in the interest of both you and your girlfriend you should most likely review her lease for any clauses relating to people not explicitly on the lease taking up tenancy. Often times there are fairly severe penalties for violating those sorts of things up to eviction or a substantial hike in rent. To that end it is probably in your best interest to investigate adding yourself to the lease if you two are serious about cohabitation. I hope this helps, I've been here before myself and things went badly.  Your document is probably a month-to-month sublease, and she'd have to give you 30 days to vacate. That's probably the same as if you didn't have the document. First of all, take a picture of that contract, save to gmail. Second, what does it say? That you can live there for x mnths or just that you live here? If the latter, then you're a month-tomonth tenant and she's your landlord. As such, she must legally give you 30 days notice to kick you out. If you're worried, you should save up enough savings to get you by for a few months, for you to be able to have a deposit to move in somewhere else, etc. But that's more of a /r/personalfinance thing. You're likely as much a tenant as she is - the difference is that your girlfriend is also your landlord, whereas she rents directly from the owner. What is the term of that lease? When does it expire?
