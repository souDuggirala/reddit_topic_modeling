 Hello r/legaladvice, I’ve been working at my place of employment for 2.5 years (designer). I was fired for cause this past Thursday (making avoidable mistakes, not following art instructions, letting personal life interfere with work life). I never received any written write ups or warnings about my “poor performance”. I’m currently 7 months pregnant and am beginning to think they fired me because of this reason. Do I have a chance of getting unemployment benefits? Should I consult a lawyer to see if I can sue for discrimination? Thank you - any help would be appreciated  I think you should consult with a lawyer to discuss the matter, simply because you want to review the situation and see if they really fired you for cause or if they were truly firing you because you are pregnant. The former is ok the latter is not. The problem is that assuming the allegations you mention are true, it would be very difficult to prove that they fired you due to your pregnancy, without some sort of proof. Warnings are not required barring a union, contract, or even a policy manual (which may or may not provide protection) that has a way of handling such matters. You should file for unemployment. Absolutely.  If your employer can document that any of these things are true then a wrongful termination lawsuit would probably go nowhere. Yes you can file for unemployment and should do so immediately however after the baby is born you will be unable to work for a time so during those weeks you cannot claim benefits. once you are medically cleared to return to work you can resume claiming benefits and looking for another job Absent an employment contract calling for warnings, they can fire you for cause without one regardless of if you are pregnant or not. If you suspect the cause is your pregnancy and not the three reasons you outlined, consult a lawyer.
