 I am trying to purchase a Yamaha scooter 49cc from a craigslist seller and I was wondering if I needed a title for the state of Oklahoma or do I only need a proof of purchase (I forgot what itâ€™s called). In all my question is do I need to have him transfer the title / is a title even required for a scooter at 49 cc?
