 I apologize I'm just posting this for a friend. nbsp; My friend Sarah just broke up with her boyfriend of 3 years. After a recent down hill trend relationship and becoming thousands of dollars in debt, Sarah has gotten tired of supporting him. nbsp; Sarah had a friend come over today with a truck to help move some stuff, James the ex tried threw a tantrum and threw stuff everywhere and threatened everyone. James threatened to kill himself if Sarah takes the dog as well. He threatened to call the cops as well. nbsp; At this point I'm posting this because I want to make sure I help my friend and navigate this situation as best as possible. Sarah, You should probably tell your ex boyfriend to seek council for his instability which is beyond the scope of immediate concern for you, hence the breakup. There is no reason for any further discussion beyond what is necessary to coordinate relocating your possessions. If problems proceed, or are likely to persist, don’t be afraid to request the presence of law enforcement. It’s best if this is done as a preventative measure, prior to escalation. Sincerely, A south Texas cowhand. P.S. if relevant: there’s no need to be embarrassed or fabricate characters to ask for advice. If not, sarah should create a Reddit account.   This is what you and your friend should have done. What’s the legal question? And is she willing to get the police involved? Because if not, the answers here will be limited. Whose dog is it? I'm doubtful the police would get involved with this civil matter.
