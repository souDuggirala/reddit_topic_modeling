 I’m sure there are others with this question, and I’m not the type of guy to physically assault someone. Live in Texas in a 12 Man Bar League, won the league and the commissioner has gone dark. In Texas we have a $500 Grand Theft Law, is there any legal repercussions the winners can take to lead to payment or punishment? I know the gambling laws have been relaxed in Texas for fantasy football, but do we even have a leg to stand on; or should we just take it as a 50 dollar lesson? We have video of him receiving the money, and texts about the buy in amount. Thanks
