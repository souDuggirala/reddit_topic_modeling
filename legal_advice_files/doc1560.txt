 I pay $25 a month for trash pickup. Thursday through Sunday, Our trash cans are supposed to be outside our apartment by 6 pm and they should be picked up by 8. I’ve lived here since August, and it’s been a fight to get my trash picked up every single month. They very rarely pick it up. I would prefer not to pay for trash pickup, especially if they’re not going to do it. I would rather take my own trash but I can’t opt out of it and I can’t seem to get them to take it. I got an email today stating if people continue to leave their trash/trash cans out it’s going to be a $50 fine. It’s a stupid argument that I’m tired of having with the apartment managers, is there any legal action I can take if I get a fine or a way around paying the $25 a month? I’m in North Carolina.  Originally leaving the trash cans out wasn’t a problem. But they stopped coming to pick up the trash and we have connecting balcony/entrances and it started to smell from people leaving bags out. They’re fining anyone who leaves a can or bag of trash out now. Usually by the end of the weekend I get frustrated and end up dumping the trash myself, but I don’t want to leave a few bags of garbage in my apartment for days just hoping they’ll come pick it up.  I'm not sure I understand. Are you being fined because you're leaving your cans out past the designated time in hopes the trash truck will come late?
