 I have a workers comp claim to file that was just less than 2 years? I know that I have a case but will this loose the case?  Thank you for your reply. All the best to you.  Unfortunately, it looks like you only have [1 year](=LAB sectionNum=5405) to file a claim in California under normal circumstances There are some specific circumstances (minor, unaware of injury, etc) in which this might be tolled, so you may want to consult with a worker's comp attorney.
