 Coworker and close friend asked if I want to be a moderator of a subreddit he moderates. It's a surprisingly large subreddit, about 1 million subs, and I think it is something I would like to try. However they have a agreement thing and one of the agreements is you have to be willing to "moderate questionable or obscene content" this concerns me because I don't want to get into hot water if I have to moderate something that might not be legal. What is the law on stuff like this? post the subreddit
