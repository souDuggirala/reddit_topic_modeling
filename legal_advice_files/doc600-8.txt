Just looking at what options I may have here.  Former employer agreed to pay me monthly distributions for earned commissions that add up about $60K. Since September, has only paid twice, each time I have to twist an arm to get a check.  I have paper trail for this agreement. Last check was received first week of October nearly two months ago. Owner has been telling me for the past 3 weeks "a check is in the mail" but nothing arrives. Super frustrating and causing a lot of stress as I still factor this into my personal budgeting.  If contacting him keeps failing, or I keep receiving the same default response, should I contact a lawyer to send them a letter or something? That makes sense. If you worked in Maryland, then you file the complaint in Maryland.  Thanks! Employee, not contractor. Their HQ is in Philadelphia, would I file here in MD or PA?  Were you an actual employee, or a contractor? If the former, file a wage complaint with the Maryland Department of Labor.
