 My brother was born in CA. He lives in Ohio and has no ID, no birth certificate and no SS card. We’re trying to figure out the how and the order of how we can obtain all of these. No help from parents, unfortunately. Thank you! I found the form for his BC and was able to get it sent in. I’ve always had my documents, so I had no idea what the process was on this.  Request a copy of his birth certificate from the state of California. Most likely would have to request from the town or city in which he was born. Use that birth certificate at a social security office to get a new social security card. Use both the birth certificate and social security card to get a state issued ID or license. Weird, I see 36. Unless this is. whoooosh moment. He's 1? I think there is a typo there.  36. He’s currently living in a shelter and on parole, so while we’re not close - I’m trying to help a bit. how old is your brother? Your brother should begin with requesting a copy of his birth certificate from the state of California.
