 I just found out landlords in my state are required to pay their tenants interest on their security deposits (link below). I've never been paid interest by a landlord. I last moved 2 years ago, does my last landlord still owe me that interest? Also, is the interest paid on the entire deposit or only on the part that is returned? [http://www.apartmentsusa.com/hawaii/hi-rent-tips-securitydeposit.htm](http://www.apartmentsusa.com/hawaii/hi-rent-tips-securitydeposit.htm) It'd be over $100, which is a fairly significant amount of money to me. If I'm interpreting it correctly, they owe me 5% interest. The security deposit was over $1000 and I was there for a couple years. Also, considering how they nickle and dimed their tenants I don't mind fighting them over this. Edit: Over $200 if I can collect interest since I moved out. Do you really wanna fight for the possibility of $10 from 2 years ago? I reccomend moving on.
