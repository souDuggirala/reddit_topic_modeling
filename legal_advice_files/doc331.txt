 So I received a phone call from one of my co-workers lawyers (call went to voicemail). I don't talk to lawyers over the phone, and have no intention of being part of any class action/lawsuit against my place of work. The lawyer stated that he received my contact information from my co-worker and that any statements I make would be anonymous. I was just wondering what could happen if I did call the lawyer back and discuss the issue. Additionally what sort of legal ramifications would come from me informing my employer of the voice mail/potential litigation. You don't need to talk to them. But you may get a subpoena which you cannot ignore.
