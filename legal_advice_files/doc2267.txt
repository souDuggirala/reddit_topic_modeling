 I'm trying to get back my money from my ex-roommate. I filed for small claims and she didn't sign the certified mail, so I had to go to court without her, where they rescheduled my court date to February. After I got out of the court room they had me go back to the clerk who had me fill out a new form. "Memorandum to Department of Civil Records - Instructions for Alias Summons" followed by check boxes for private process or civil process. I checked civil process. The rest of it was just names and address of my ex-roommate and I. [This]() is what's on the online tracker for my case now. What does all of this mean? What am I supposed to do now?
