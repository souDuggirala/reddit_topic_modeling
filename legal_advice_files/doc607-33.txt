Basically, my roommate and I had a falling out and his behavior is extremely erratic. He already committed credit card fraud using my payment information today. I don't know what he might do next... I did sell him ecstasy that I bought from someone else a while back. If he decides to show that to the authorities, will I get into any trouble?

&amp;#x200B; Will the texts incriminate him for buying/attempting to buy ecstasy as well?  That would be sheer stupidity on his part, but people do stupid shit all the time, so who knows.  As said earlier, it could bring attention on you.  The text messages in and of themselves would not provide probable cause for a charge.  However, it will certainly draw interest to you and further investigation could certainly lead to charges if additional evidence is obtained.  I wouldn't worry about it.

A.  What's he going to do, turn himself in for buying just to shade you for selling?   Not likely.

B.   Realistically, texts don't mean anything.   People joke all the time.    Pretty much the only time texts are troublesome is if you sold to an undercover and there is physical drugs evidence which is supported by the texts.   Texts can help bolster a case with physical evidence, but don't make much of a case on their own.
