 Location: USA, MN. My landlady, with whom I share a duplex, is a hoarder. Her hoarding is of reality TV proportions. If her side of the duplex is condemned, would the entire building including my side, which I rent, be condemned as well? Or will I have tenant rights of some sort? INAL. It would depend on the exact circumstances. Maybe, maybe not. If you are concerned about the possibility, you may wish to move when your lease is up. I would suggest calling adult protective services, but it’s a toss up if they’d give her help (it is a mental illness) or a forced cleanup, which makes the hoarding worse.
