 If my mother passes, but I have had not contact with her in years, am I legally obligated to take care of her remains?  Thank you very much. No will , no money, just don't want to have to pay her bills. Step 1: Check the will. If there is no will: You need to check the intestacy rules for your jurisdiction. So my older brother would technically be first in priority?  Yes , thank you.  In common-law jurisdictions, the obligation to deal with the deceased's remains generally falls on the Estate Trustee. You can generally choose not to act as estate trustee if you are first in priority. No.
