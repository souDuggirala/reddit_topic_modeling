 Hi everyone, I recently got a speeding ticket going down Int 87 towards NYC. I was getting out of work to go home for the day and the officer clocked me at going 70 in a 50 zone. I logged onto the web portal and it is saying that I got 2 tickets, each worth 4 points, that day. I have the physical copy of the ONLY ticket the officer gave me that day and the ticket number matches with one of the numbers in the portal, but there is one not matching. Should I plead not guilty and take this to court? The officer told me he was experiencing difficulties on his computer so maybe there was a glitch? Need some help on how to handle this please.  Yep, welcome to the real world pal. Negative actions have negative consequences, what a surprise. It says the same reason as the original "speeding zone 11-30" What is the second ticket for?
