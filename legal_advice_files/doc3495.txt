 So around 2 years ago, I was injured at my apartment due to the conditions there being dangerous. I was forced out of the apartment due to the injury and shortly after hired a lawyer. It has been just shy of 2 years since this happened, and my demand letter still has not been sent from my lawyer and I am very frustrated with the slow process and complete lack of updates. Unless I email first, I won't hear anything and be left in the dark. Last time we were in touch was mid-September and my lawyer indicated they were finishing up the demand letter, but I haven't heard since. I'm worried about how I'll come across to them to email every couple months. I'm not sure at all what to do, I am afraid the case isn't being worked on and time will continue to pass as the deadline approaches. I was under the impression that the case would have progressed by now, but is that wrong? I haven't gotten any idea of the timeline, when to expect the demand sent, really anything. How can I go about contacting my lawyer to lay out these concerns? I'm wondering if I made a mistake with my lawyer choice and worried I will run out of time to file suit before my current lawyer gets going or I switch to a new one. Is this a typical process? Should I be worried? Is there anything I can do to get this moving finally? Thank you!!
