 I went out drinking the other night and had a few too many. As the night was winding down, I started talking to this group of older women. I thought one was into me, and I put my hand on her back. Eventually it slid down to her butt. A bouncer saw me and politely told me to leave, which I obliged. On the way out, he gave me a talk about how there was a time when that kind of behavior was acceptable, but not any more. He told me that if the girl wants to press charges, they will have to file a report. I thanked him and was on my way. Now look, I'm not trying to admonish what I did in any way whatsoever. It was a really scummy thing to do, even if I didn't intend on doing it. It's something I would never do sober or to a random woman, and I feel like a total low life because of it. Still, though, I'm incredibly worried that she will press charges, and what that might entail. I'm too embarrassed to talk to my IRL friends about it, but it's hard for me to think rationally about it, either. Should I be concerned and should I lawyer up, or should I wait and see what happens? This happened Saturday night so I don't know how quickly these reports can be filed or a summons or whatever can occur. Please understand that I know I did something awful. If I could rewind the night and not go to the bar, I would. I've also resolved to stop drinking and going out--I just can't trust myself anymore. I'm not looking for moralizing or sympathy, only practical answers. Thank you.
