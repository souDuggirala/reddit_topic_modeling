 I'm in the process of starting a business, and I want to use a two-word phrase in my business name that is trademarked. For example, lets say the phrase is "Baby Bird" and it's a subdivision of a nationwide brand that makes skin care products. And let's say, I want to name my business "Baby Bird Boutique" and sell children's clothes. From what I gather, since we are not selling the same type of products and there's not a likelihood of confusion it could be allowed. I just don't want to be open to potential legal action. I love the name I want to use, but if it will be more of a headache than it's worth, I will (sadly, lol) use a different one.
