I was hit by a car (California) and my medical treatment will likely be minor.  My medical insurance covers nearly 100% so it wouldn't make sense to hire an attorney who receives 30% of any settlement I may receive.

I want to be reimbursed for a few things like damaged clothing and pain/impairment that may last a few weeks or months.  I would like to hire an attorney to handle this and let them bill their fees to the insurance company.  Is this not possible?  So far I'm having trouble getting an attorney to call me back.  Do I need to deal with the insurance claim on my own since my injuries/damages are not severe?

 That's unfortunate. I was hoping to not waste my time calling an insurance company that will try to deny my claim. Any tips on filing a claim? How do I request compensation for time off work, transportation costs, loss of mobility, etc.?

 [removed] It is not possible. 

Absent a contractual agreement with the insurance company, the “American Rule” says that each side pays its own attorney’s fees.  The only way to know is to speak with an attorney about your options.  Most will offer a free consultation.  It is also highly unlikely that you would be able to get your attorney fees paid for by the defendant.
