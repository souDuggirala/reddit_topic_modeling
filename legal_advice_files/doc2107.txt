 Just to clarify, my grandmother and mother live together and share the cable bill. This past month, my grandmother offered to pay the entire cable bill using her checking account. The cable bill is in my mother’s name and my mother logged into her account so my grandmother could enter her information and pay it. Everything was fine, payment went through until a few days later the cable company shut off their service. My mother called the cable company and they basically told her that since my grandmother had an outstanding debt with the cable company under her own account, they used her payment to pay off her outstanding debt instead of paying the bill under my mother’s name. Is this legal for them to do? I live in the state of Georgia. If it isn’t, what are their options? Thank you! That’s what I figured. Yes that is legal. Grandma should have read the contract that she agreed to when she signed up for cable and when she included her checking account number for payment.  . As someone whose family did these same tricks to keep their unaffordable premium cable packages going ... I’m right there with you.
