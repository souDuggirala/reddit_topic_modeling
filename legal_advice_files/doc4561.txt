 We have used a template we found on one PA countyâ€™s website for a custody agreement and customized it for our situation. Do we need a lawyer or can we just submit it directly to the court itself for review and approval to make it a binding custody agreement? You're welcome to send it front of a judge, they prefer people actually be amicable.
