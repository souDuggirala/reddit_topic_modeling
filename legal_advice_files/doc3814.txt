 Alright, so I just bought a Tesla Model 3 on November 17th 2018. I was offered $55,700 in financing for the car if I was planning on keeping my current vehicle and $60,700 for the car if I was planning on trading in my current vehicle. I decided to trade my Ford Explorer in and to get the car fully finances minus my $2500 down payment. When I go to pick up the vehicle, I'm presented with paperwork stating financing for $58,200 and that I owed them $2500 more than was agreed upon. I told that them was incorrect and made them give me paperwork stating the original agreement to sign which they did and which I signed for the full $60,700. 3 weeks later, I still don't have my permanent registration for the vehicle so I call them and they look into it. I receive a call back stating that it hasn't gone through because I still owe them $2500 and that the financing was for $58,000. I was told that I could either pay them the $2500 or have my credit re-run again in order to hopefully get approved for the correct amount. I'm now closing in on having my temporary registration expire and the car I gave them still hasn't had the previous loan paid off (I gave them over $6000 to pay off what I was upside down on this car). Do I have any legal standing here to tell them it's not my fault they screwed up and I will not be paying them $2500 additional? I'm fine if they get the credit situation resolved (although not happy about them having to re-run it) but I do not want to come out of pocket anymore when that wasn't the agreement.  The total amount never changed. Just how much they were proposing to finance. Essentially they ended up financing the car for $2500 less than we agreed upon due to some internal error on their end. Why did the total amount go up? Did the interest rate change or the principle or something else? It's possible the financing deal you got was conditional upon approval.
