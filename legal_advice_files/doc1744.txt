 I recently went through a really rough patch in life, and a scammer was able to take advantage of me (convinced me to deposit my cash into a bitcoin ATM into their account). I'm angry at myself for being too dumb, but now I now want to fight this somehow, what recourse do I have? 0. You can begin by filing a complaint with the police, including everything you know about the scammer. If you know who the scammer is, you can also look at suing them in small claims court (or regular court if the amount is too high). Unfortunately, it is common for scammers to make it very hard to come after them because it is impossible to identify them and/or they are not in the country. What do you know about the scammer?
