 So, I met a girl on POF and she gave me her text number We texted and she said to pay her £25 to come to my place and make me some "company". I paid (stupid I know), then she said "oh, you should have put my full name" etc etc. "I work for a company so it has to be that way. Pay now to my full name and then they will refund" Of course I said I wouldn't then she said she would ruin my life. Then comes the word part "she wrote a message saying she was 12. Her birth certificate says she is 12 and that I paid a 12 year old for sex." And then said something abou my family and £100 - I can see this is a scam. Can I really have trouble with this? It’s a scam. There is no girl. There’s a grown man in west Africa (most likely) pretending to be a girl and/or her father, hoping to get money from you. This same question gets posted in this sub literally every day. If you continue to fret about it, I will become angry and bite your nose.  The only reason I am scared is that she/he wrote that message and deleted it straight away, that's why.. Stop being scared. There was never a 12 year old girl. It's a scam.   .this might help. I can't imagine you being in any trouble with law - you were not under any impression that the girl was under age. I'd keep all messages you can though just in case she does notify the police. There was no girl. The police won't knock on your door because you paid some middle aged balding man for sex.  That's what I did. Its legal in the UK to pay, at least the research I have found says so. Not to minors of course, though. Literally dont want a police officer knocking on my door for this. Scared as hell Tell em to go fuck them selves.  No, just block and ignore.  Can this person really screw me over? Of course it's a scam. There was no girl. Stop trying to pay for sex.
