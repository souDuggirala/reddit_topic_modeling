 I was driving in NY and had to go over the Mid-Hudson bridge. There was some type of commotion on the other side because some old guy was threatening to jump into the frigid water below. The state troopers stopped traffic in both directions and I got out like so many other drivers on the bridge but some cop gave me a hefty ticket for as he put it "hindering flow of traffic" because as he would later reveal that I snapped a selfie with the guy threatening to jump behind me as the emergency crews worked to rescue him. I wasn't talking a selfie and plan to fight it. Is why am I being singled out for a ticket when others drivers gawked my best argument? He didn't jump and is probably doing fine. I didnt want to capture someone's misfortune. You sure you weren’t just trying to gawk at someone else’s misfortune? I would say it’s in pretty poor taste to snap a pic of a guy who is on the brink of suicide but that’s just me. 🤷🏻‍♀️ I admit to snapping a photo but I wanted to capture the rescue by Ny's finest!! You say you weren’t taking a selfie but were you taking pictures of the scene? I would imagine that might have been why you were ‘singled out’ as opposed to others.
