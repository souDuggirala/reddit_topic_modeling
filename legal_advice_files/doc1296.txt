 My girlfriend we will call her "Piper" has a child that she conccved with sperm from a cryobank. She decided that she wanted to get a 23 and Me test done to better understand her child's health and ancestry. As a result a family member saw her child on the sight and reported her to the cryobank and now the bank is threatening to sue to sue her, (I'm assuming just a threat) they also confiscated the rest of her vials that she was planning on using at some point down the road. Just to keep things clear the contract does not say anything about not being able to obtain a DNA test (as far as I know that would be illegal, who has the right to tell you what you can do with your DNA or your child's) it only says that you may not contact the donor (nothing about family). We have called around to a few lawyers and non of them seem knowledgeable about the circumstances of her problem. Oh sorry I didn't understand what you were exactly asking. It's a huge paragraph! They are claiming that her purpose for doing the DNA test was to find the donor, which is untrue. There are a multitude of reasons to do a DNA test such as ancestry breakdown and detailed health information.  Right, but which clause of the contract? Breach of contract like the title says What are they threatening to sue for exactly?
