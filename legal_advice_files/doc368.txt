 Hello! This is a strange and maybe municipality-specific question. But me and my roommates found a cat we would really like, however there seems to be a possible issue. Essentially when we signed the lease the leaser had originally said (I think) that cats are allowed but no dogs. The lease itself however says no pets allowed. However I just talked to my neighbours and the ENTIRE building has cats except for us. If the entire building has cats, is it unreasonable for our landlord to deny us a cat, assuming he doesnâ€™t agree to negotiate with us about it? If it helps, I live in Montreal. Thanks!  if your lease says no cats then no cats until you negotiate a new agreement, your landlord doesn't have to agree just because it is reasonable. As a side note you and your roommate should not adopt a cat together. If one of you wants the cat that one person should get, and be fully responsible for the cat (meaning they need to be able to afford the cat, including both regular and emergency vet care). It is generally unlikely that the two of you will live together 15+ years but a cat may live with one of you that long.
