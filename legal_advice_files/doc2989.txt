 My biology lab today is having us do an experiment where we have to drink a large amount of water or Gatorade and then pee in a cup and measure the amount and the ph levels which we are supposed to record on our lab papers. Also, if we have any medical history, including cardiovascular history, normal blood pressure, urinary problems, or history of diabetes. We are supposed to volunteer to be apart of the control group. All labs are mandatory participation to pass the class. Is this legal??  Posted by [deleted] Unless they are making you do it in front of your peers, I donâ€™t think so. Why should it be illegal? Life will be hard for you. nobody can answer this without knowing where you are, different places have different laws.
