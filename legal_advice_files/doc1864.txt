 I live with my mom along with my brother, while we were renting (my brother helped with rent and dad paid about $300 a month on my behalf, since Im 15) my mom told us (she pays the majority of it) and our landlord we would be late on rent in August. he changed the locks the day we didn't pay which is illegal. We stayed at our mom's boyfriend's house for 2 days until she got the money, which then he let us back in. After that, she sued for him trying to perform a "self help eviction" so by Florida law we would get atleast 3 months of rent as compensation. So with pretty much 3 free months of rent, we stayed until January 6 where my mom didn't have time to pack up all the stuff before the eviction date (a bit dumb on her part, but she works a ton, usually 12 hrs a day) so he threw it out. A TV, some cabinets and my brothers desktop PC. My mom is really stressed out right now about all that and really angry too, but not sure what to do. So what would she do now? Are there any laws against this? Tl;Dr: got evicted, didn't have time to take all our possessions with us, landlord threw them away Please review the [Landlord Tenant Questions]() section of the /r/LegalAdvice Wiki for common questions and answers regarding landlord tenant issues.
