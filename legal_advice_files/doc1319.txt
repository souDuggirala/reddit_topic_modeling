 Right off the bat, this is a hypothetical - I've been messing around with the idea of a body going missing for a story I've been working on. Are there any laws regarding this type of issue? And specifically, are there any states in which this is a misdemeanor? No location specifically, but I'm in New Jersey. Gotcha, thanks Removed because hypotheticals go in r/legaladviceofftopic
