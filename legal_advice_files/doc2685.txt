 My boss has come on to me multiple times over the course of just over 4 years. He solely is the one that decides my bonus, reviews , pay increase etc I was very intoxicated once over 4 years ago when a sexual incident occurred. Him bringing it up and asking me for it and me being too intoxicated to realize - he bought the drinks Since this time, when we are on business trips he will phone my work phone late at night, call the hotel room repeatedly early in the morning , if I don’t answer he will continue to call. If I pick up he will ask if he can come to my room, and I have to repeat no several times before he drops it When we are at a group dinner or out for drinks (along with several of my peers - at least 8-10 people) he will whisper in my ear I’m sexy, multiple times I have gone to the washroom and he has followed me in and I’ve had to ask my him leave. He has also tried to grab me in my office when it’s just the two of us and when we are in meetings will whisper inappropriate comments in my ear Currently it’s my word against his. How do I get him to stop and let head office know what he’s doing and hold him accountable to having it stopped I’m scared it will affect my career and I’m afraid he will retaliate  This is a fairly serious human rights issue. Talk to a lawyer. Most provinces give free legal advice to people contemplating bringing a claim at a Human Rights Tribunal. Most cities also have lawyers willing to give free legal advice re human rights issues.
