 Hi, I lived in a house in college that after we moved out of, had some damages. We gave up the security deposit and wondered if there would be a bill. A bill came and it was for a ridiculous amount. We then said we will pay only if we can see all the receipts for the work done. They couldn’t provide any and they left it at that, not asking for any money. Today I got a call from a debt collection office for that money. What can I do? The people I lived with are long gone and I can’t afford to pay it all myself. It just doesn’t seem right how they went about this.  Perfect. Thank you First thing is to tell the debt collector that you dispute the debt. They are legally required to stop all collection actions until they have "verified" the debt. All they have to do, is prove that they doubt a debt in your name. They will do so via a piece of mail, or they will drop the matter and release their action. If they 'validate' the debt, you can formally send them notice that you dispute that amount, and then you can provide them your evidence that you asked for receipts and none was given. Your landlords remedy was to pursue this in court, not to just "sell" a debt. They are circumventing their legal remedies to get a quick payday and this is going to bite them hard, if what you said is true.
