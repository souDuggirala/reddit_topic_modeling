 I live in a small, off campus apartment complex next to my university. as the winter has begun i've noticed a few practices of this building that i do not agree with, namely i am not given an invoice or breakdown of rent charges as I pay them. They give me a number to pay and if I don't pay it my credit score is impacted and i have to pay a fine. The problem is that i also pay for my electricity, a bill that is handled for me by the building. Despite several attempts they refuse to let me view my billing statement from the electric company, and these charges are getting more and more irregular. Today i had to pay my electric bill, which operates on a bimonthly cycle, for the second time in a month. when questioned about this I received no comment from the building or its staff. I am pretty sure withholding billing information the way they are is illegal, but im not entirely sure.  What does your lease say with regards to paying utilities?
