 I cannot find a straight answer to this, but basically I know that a game is collecting anonymous data like: Phone model and screen resolution Specific information about how I play the game, like time I spend beating a level or just playing the game daily. The game never disclosed this, is possible to sue the publisher or taking the app down? What would you sue the publisher for? What are your damages?
