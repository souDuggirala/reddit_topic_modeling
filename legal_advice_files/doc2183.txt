 Hey all, I was a student with Careers Australia. I was 17 at the time of enrollment and had just dropped from high school... so there shows my life decisions. The provider went into voluntary admission, in May of 2017. So that was fun. Then in September I received a phone call saying I had 3 options, one was continuing the course (which I never wanted to do), pay for the units I had complete, which was 3 or 4 and receive a statement of attainment (which I never received) and I forgot the last option. I went with option 2 to only pay for the courses I have completed. This was over a year ago, and nothing has happened with anything. I have also been rejected to start studying for anything else while this was all happening, ruining my chances to get a half decent job as I was told I was put on hold and they weren't allowed to enroll me. So I was wondering, in term of Australia. Do I have any legal way to get rid of this stupid debt, or am I able to sue any involved parties, to try and get it reimbursed and damages, for the hardships I have endured during the process (really tempered with my progress on my mental health.. but no records) /r/AusLegal is more familiar with Australian law.
