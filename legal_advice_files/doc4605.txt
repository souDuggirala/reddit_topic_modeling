 My 90 year old father has used a nickname his whole life as his first name, it's on his driver's license, social security card, checking account and VA medical records. The only record his "legal" first name shows up is on his birth certificate. (Obviously this wouldn't work in today's world but 70+ years ago you filled out the paperwork with what your name was and that's what was used - you didn't need a birth certificate to get a driver's license and once you got the driver's license, that was your identification for everything else). Recently my father moved into a Veteran's home. It's a nice place but they insist on addressing him by his "legal" name, the one on his birth certificate. All the paperwork, medications, correspondence is addressed to his "legal" name. This causes him grief/anxiety/confusion as it's not his name - his legal name is his father's name, whom he had a distressing relationship with and he's never gone by it. The home says they cannot change his name on their records so my question is how does one perform a legal name change? How long does it take and what does it cost? Is it something I can do for him, do we have to go to court, what is the process? Thanks in advance. Is there a social worker/case manager located at the facility? Not calling your father by his preferred name is a dignity issue. I’d start there.  I did this with my name recently in NY. There were Do It Yourself documents I downloaded, paid a county clerk fee and then a small fee to have a public notice printed in a newspaper per the judges order after the judge stamped his approval. Hopefully it’s as easy to do in CA. I imagine it’s fairly common in Hollywood land.
