 Explanation: At my local public school, there is a set of stairs, at the rear of the building, adjacent to a parking lot. These stairs have not been maintained this school year (2018-2019) where snow removal is concerned. Snow from one of the playgrounds is being bulldozed down the stairs, rendering the stairs dangerous and inoperable. A concerned parent sent an email to the school, showing pictures of said stairs, and explained how they felt it was dangerous, etc. The parent received an email from the school's facility manager explaining that the dangerous stairs in question were put in "years ago" by parents who had children at the school. Additionally, the facilities manager said the stairs are not an asset belonging to the school district. As such, the stairs do not get "replaced, repaired, and or maintained by the district." Legal Questions: 1. Is the school district ultimately responsible for the maintenance of the stairs, even if the stairs were a gift from parents? 2. If the school district has maintained the stairs in the past, does that mean the school district is required to do so in the future? 3. If the school district is unwilling to maintain the stairs, is the school district responsible for removing the stairs? 4. Do the stairs qualify as an attractive nuisance? Thank you in advance. Thank you for your reply. I appreciate your time. Yes, they are. Just sounds like the school hasn't allocated funds to maintain the stairs. If the stairs aren't needed, they should be able to block access and not maintain them. But if access is still available, the school district would typically be required to keep them safe. I would contact the school board next. Are the stairs on the school district's property?
