 Back in September we got our roof done along with interior work and we went through our insurance. _____________________ We signed a contract paper that stated the full cost would be $16,000 along with a possible supplement while the work was being done a letter was sent to our insurance for $4000 of depreciation Minus a $2,100 deductible Our roof and interior was done and we were happy a bill with the work up of all the materials and everything was sent to us. This bill was for $20,000 weve paid all but the deductible.. We are currently paying it now... ___________________ My question....... What the actual HELL is a supplement? The price rose $4,000 from what we signed for which was $16,000. It did say there would be a possible supplement. Although, we NEVER signed anything for the actual supplement. Is this legal? Can I get money back based on this? I guess i feel like this roofing company charged more than they should have charged for the roof. I feel they sucked our insurance dry. Dont roofing companies get their materials cheap? I feel they did and charged more for materials just so they could reep the rewards from our insurance money... ________________________ What do you think?
