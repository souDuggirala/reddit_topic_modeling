 So, a friend of mine owes me roughly 10 Dollars, he's owed me this money since sometime around October 11th or a little bit later, and he has been signed into his instagram on my PC for a while now, i decided i want to get on my account but before i do that I prank him by changing is Name (not @) bio profile picure. I tell him and then he says it's fine now we're even, now I don't owe you. Yes I know it may seem petty because of 10 USD but the fact of the matter is that he said (with witnesses) that he'll pay me back. Im not willing to sue or anything of that level, i'm not that determined to get my money. I live in South Africa if that helps we're both still in school. This is actually legally binding. Any debt under 20 USD is to be dismissed in the case of the person owed pulling a practical joke on the person who owes the money. Source: personal experience (lost 15 USD) /s I don’t believe this sub is capable of giving you advice beyond you’re on your own, if you don’t want to take legal action then you just need to explain it to him and have your witnesses back your side  Its $10.00, just move on and never lend him money again.
