 Sorry I am writing on mobile. Throwaway account. So this woman I know is currently in a homeless shelter with her 3 kids. Her husband is in jail for a violent incident back in Russia and she used this as an opportunity to escape and she ended up in Massachusetts. The oldest child finds ways to still contact his father who is still serving time in Russia. The mother wants to divorce the father but she does not want to go back to Russia because she fears for her life. The mother reports that the father constantly threatens her life to the oldest child. This child is more aligned with their father and wonâ€™t cease communication. Is there anything that the mother can do? Does she have options? Thank you  She can file for divorce in MA if she's lived there long enough for the state to have jurisdiction (usually ~6 months) The homeless shelter may be able to direct her to additional resources, such as legal aid
