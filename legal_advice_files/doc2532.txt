 So I found out my HOA put a lien on my home. I haven't paid because they literally do nothing for the homes on my street because they said "we live on a city street". Our common area was a restuarant that closed down. I owe them almost 4k. I dont want to have issues with my home so I told them that I wanted to pay off my debit. They sent me a forbearance agreement. I'm just curious what can they actually do to me and if there is a way to get out of the hoa. Thanks for the time and help My luck haha thanks What can they do to you? Well, they can put a lien against your home. This encumbers the title and means you can’t really sell until you pay them. How can you get out from the HOA? Sell your house. But see point 1. There is no really effective method of un-joining an HOA, because the HOA membership is typically a covenant that is attached to the land.  Florida permits HOAs to seek a foreclosure on properties on which they’ve placed liens for unpaid or past due fees, if the HOA has followed the laws regarding notice of the lien. So ultimately, it is possible that they could foreclose and take your property if you don’t pay.  I live in new mexico because of the military but my home is in fl What state are you in?
