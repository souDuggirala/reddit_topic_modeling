 I am currently the plaintiff in a federal complaint that is nearing the six month mark. Do federal judges care at all about being put on the six month list, or does it not really matter to them? Iâ€™m curious to see whether the judge will hasten the decision to dismiss my complaint or allow it to go to trial. I know that it likely depends on the judge, just want to hear all of your leanings. In my district it is taken quite seriously.  Not very. Especially if your complaint is in a district with not enough judges.
