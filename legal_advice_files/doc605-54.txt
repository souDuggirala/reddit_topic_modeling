Hello,

I was reading the ORC [(link here to section in question)](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2907) and the obscenity clause seems to apply to all pornographic content. Am I reading this wrong, or is all porn considered obscene in Ohio? If it really is obscene, does this mean that anybody who posts a nude photo who lives in Ohio can be prosecuted due to the [pandering obscenity](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2907.32v1) section of the ORC? Could the viewer also be prosecuted? I'm wondering this because I have friends who are camgirls, and it seems like that could be illegal...

Edit: Also, how does the federal definition of obscenity as defined in Miller v California interact with this? Posting rule 5. It would be ok in this sub if you got into a situation regarding the obscenity law. If you are just curious, it goes to off topic. I think that it follows the rules of this sub as it relates to a legal concept and there is a specific question being asked that relates to a real situation, so I donâ€™t see why it should be in off topic. /r/legaladviceofftopic rule 5.
