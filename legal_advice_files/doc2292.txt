 Live in MA looking to break my lease. There is a $1,350 rental change fee i must pay to the broker before I find a replacement tenant to take my spot. I asked them if I could recover it through the new lease and where the new tenant would also pay that fee to the broker and they would indemnify me. They won't do that but said i could set up an arraignment directly with the new tenant, whats the best way to go about this?
