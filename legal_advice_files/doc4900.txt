  My brother has been in jail in Tijuana for several weeks. We have not heard from him or seen him. The attorney (who is reputable) has told us not to visit, but is now saying we should go down to this court near the border for a hearing. Can someone tell me what this hearing is for and if we should make the trip down there to attend this hearing? Our family does not live in California. Edit for location bot: brother used to love in San Diego. He moved to Rosarito because it was cheaper and still close enough to the VA.
