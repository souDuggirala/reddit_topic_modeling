 Hello. This is my first time posting on this subreddit (and hopefully my last, if all goes well) so, sorry if formatting is off. I work as a mechanic at a decently sized dealership branch. My first paycheck was due on Friday, but due to some complications, they said it would be in Saturday. I didn't think much of it, and I continued on with my day. Today is Tuesday, and they continued to put it off. Telling me that it would come the next available day. I'm trying not to sound like I have a stick up my ass, but I Really do need the money. I have bills that have already overdrafted my account, and rent coming up soon too. Is there anything I can do about the situation, is the situation even right at all?  Originally direct deposit, but they screwed it up, and said they'd give me a paper check for this pay cycle.  Is it a paper check or direct deposit?
