 The age of consent where I live is 16. So, a man could have consensual sex with a 16 year old and it’s not against the law. If you have a naked picture of a person under the age of 18, it’s considered child pornography. Could a person be charged for having a naked image of a minor while not being charged for actually having a sexual relationship with them?? Absolutely. Yes, they are entirely separate charges
