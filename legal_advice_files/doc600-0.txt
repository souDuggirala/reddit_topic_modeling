This is to all zoom car users, the incident which we have experienced  was very tragic. We booked a car on Fridays 30th November early in the  morning and the dropping date was 2 dec at 9pm. Unfortunately we  couldn't drop the car on  time so we tried to extend for few more hours    but  the response was "unable to extend,please drop the car on time  since there is one more booking on the same car".This was done multiple  times(tried extending,received the same response).Since we were  running out of time we were compelled to rush over highways.. We were  driving through the NH 77/44., with out any intimation/warning message  during journey over NH 44 close to Hosur with 80kmph car steering and  the brake drops(even though having all the transmitters/gps) car was  completely out of control and about flip through the road... 5 members  inside the car were almost died. With great difficulty we were forced to  skid off the road without getting hurt. We had a hell of a traumatic  experience which no one should ever have! And we are unable to contact [Zoomcar](https://www.facebook.com/zoomcar.in/?__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARBgAIo96KgwPbdaGnKy4XLhXilZjDB51RWo5ZFsQUwN6GWPsjBjtcvMpja939rUlTEvKvTqH1ZQJhaK&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCj4e4i-6im5bwcmEW8KQI0K_cox3vAo1FVb2GMFUJREYOwOWN7yke5dc7cAiBwTEKoxQiJUdyAt7Bivyf1AVjbxpU4sEj7edpAuB7mGjw1HKT13cBYk5LjsKqPD7n-lmVbJt6yhwsP5LHKc6TvU_dx3CAsCjIn_JFTAtiJWTr7HX9lDyREZtodZyAoE08p7PCGNN5vrrWnb7Y-oQ)  by any means through their customer support portal to report the  incident and complaint.
