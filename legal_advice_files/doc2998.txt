 Is it legal for a student to record in a public school in a one party consent state and with out student,teacher or parents consent. Ok that's for all the help. 👍 Depends on what your recording. Usually recording minors opens alot no-no doors. Not as long as you are part of the conversation that is being recorded.  Can they press any legal charges? Yes it is legal, but you can still face punishment from the school.
