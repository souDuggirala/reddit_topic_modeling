 Can a tenant in a house with multiple tenants put up a security camera in a common living room and record the other tenants without their permission or permission from the landlord Thanks for the correction! When i did my brief look into this a few months ago it was for audio (soecifically phone calls), i assumed it would be the same for video but looks like i was wrong. Thanks again!  Unlike the other commenters, I AM a Canadian lawyer. The answer is "no." I AM a lawyer. Your information is incorrect. The constitution does NOT refer to collecting information. Those provisions are in each province's (as well as federal) privacy legislation, which typically applies to businesses and government actors only. One party consent is for AUDIO, not VIDEO.  IAMNAL If you live in Ontario then it is one party consent. However, said one parry has to be activepy present in the situation to be able to record. Ie, you can record yourself and your friend talking to each other but you cannot record the conversation of the couple in the booth behind you at a restaurant. Im not sure if its the same in other provinces.  Canadian.  Is this for the US or Canadian constitution?  IANAL Referring to the Constitution, a citizen has the right to complete privacy, and to collect information about an individual, its further distribution and use without their consent is prohibited. You’re allowed to have “nanny cams” but it’s illegal to distribute without the other party’s consent.
