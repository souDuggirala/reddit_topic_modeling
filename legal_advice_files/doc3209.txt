 My husband was fired on Friday in WV, USA. I have already had him fill out unemployment in our state hopefully he will qualify. The biggest issue I’m having it he is missing his paycheck from 12.10.18 They deposited 200$ which was only the PTO he cashed in the paycheck before, but they messed up and it went on this one. Today he got his deposit for 12.25.18 and it was $22 and some change.So again they are missing pay about 3000. He is now fired and I don’t know what to do to help him. He also has half a paycheck that he would of been paid 1.10.19 isn’t there a law saying if your fired they have a certain amount of time to get the money to you? He talked to work earlier today. So I’ll tell him to call again once he calculates it.  He has tried to contact them since the first issue and nothing is working. They keep referring to someone else. Sometimes they say the check was mailed 2 weeks ago and some say it’ll be DD today, which it doesn’t look like that’s the case.  In WV they have 72 hours to pay you everything they owe you if they fire you. Your husband (not you, no employer should talk to a 3rd party about wages) needs to contact his employer, inform them he is aware that they have 72 hours to pay him what he is owed, tell them exactly what he believes he is owed (itemized, don't just guess), and let them know he will be filing a complaint if he doesn't have his check by close of business. 12/26. I doubt they are open today. Then file a claim. Here's a link [\_Collection/Employees/Pages/default.aspx]() Is there a payroll department? Ask them. Payroll people don't care if you were fired or quit or whatever you're just another person with a pay check question. Resolving it internally is going to be much better if that's possible vs. an unpaid wage complaint.
