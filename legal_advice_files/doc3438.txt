 Hey guys, So I received a court summons today over some unpaid debt that I had toward my University; about $1k that wasn't covered by my financial aid at the time. I thought I could just pile it on the the tens of thousands of dollars I'm already in debt with, but I suppose not and I digress. I'm still a teenager, and I'm not really sure what this court situation would look like. Is this an open and shut case of the university getting their money back (garnishing my wages, collection agencies etc)? Do I need to delete Facebook and lawyer up? Is there any way I can talk to my university about an installment plan or something? Just not really sure what to expect, so some kind of explanation would be helpful! Note: I work directly for my Uni and I am a student as well, if that makes any difference.
