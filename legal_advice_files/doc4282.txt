 I had a falling out with my boss today. Long story short I purchased a house from her and gave her back the things she had left there and she claims I stole some of her things. I did not, I returned everything. But after her accusation she texted me a photo of a document from court saying her company and I have been sued for a fender bender I was involved in a few months ago. I have not been served and do not know what to do from here. Am I in the clear until I am served personally? I have the photo but I do not know how to post it here.  Okay, thank you That’s a question for your boss’s attorney (if she retained one).  Okay. Do I have to show up to court? Then if there was a lawsuit involving the equipment she (her company) would be served.  It belongs to my boss. The timing was just suspicious to me.  I don’t think these are related issues. Are you an owner operator or does the equipment belong to your boss?
