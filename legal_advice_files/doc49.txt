 Someone keyed my car to a point where it was 30k damage from insurance. Idk who it was Man is messaging me waiting at my house. On Facebook he said he's gonna do a ton of stuff, and come on my property, etc. If i call the cops on him, i know he's 1.) Trespassing 2.) Battery/threatening (maybe even assault). Can i pin the car on him if he commits to physically assaulting me? Call the police. It's a crime to threaten somebody like that.
