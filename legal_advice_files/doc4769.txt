 I need information on unregistered children born in the US. One of my characters wasn't registered as a citizen and doesn't have a birth certificate or social security number or anything like that due to an abusive family member. Now she's escaped that situation, but she needs to start school and I want her to be able to have a semi normal life. What are the legal consequences of not being registered as a citizen, and are there ways to become one later on?
