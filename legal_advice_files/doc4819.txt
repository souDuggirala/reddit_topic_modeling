 This officer is getting involved in their cousin's affairs. How do I file a report or make an complaint? [deleted] You want the FBI to investigate a cop gossiping about you?  Obtain a copy of the agency's policies and procedures / general orders. Cite the specific policy violation in your complaint. Follow-up for a disposition of the complaint. If you don't feel like appropriate action was taken, your state's attorney general's office probably has some statutory responsibility to provide law enforcement oversight. If it's not the AG's office, it may be the CT State Police or another state agency. So he's done nothing except talk to you in a way you didn't like?  They won't do much here because nothing you've mentioned is a problem. He's not using his office for anything wrong.  [deleted]  You've just said involved again. Did he shoot you? Arrest you? Beat you with a rubber hose? Give your a traffic ticket? Find weed in your car? I'm guessing none of those but.... You want to complain, but there's nothing you've said the officer has done, so we don't know what you'd be complaining about.  If an officer is engaged in misconduct you report them to their own department. The FBI is not oversight of all police departments, so the short answer is you wouldn't. The longer answer would require more info than you've given... "involved in affairs" is too vague to be useful.
