 So right now we live in a three bedroom apartment in Iowa. We originally had three people on the lease, but one of them moved out and is refusing to pay her share. We all signed one lease for $1070, so we're all technically responsible for all of it, we didn't agree that each of us would pay a specific amount. Is there a way we can make her pay her share? Thanks, you've helped a lot! []() Do you know what the process would be to get that started? Documentation would be great. If you have documentation of what you and the remaining roommate were paying (cancelled checks, bank account transaction history, money order receipts, payment portal logs, etc.), plus documentation of full and timely rent payments from the landlord, it stands to reason the rest is what she was paying and that may be enough to convince a small claims judge. Do we need documentation of what she has been paying previously? Because she's been paying cash because she's a trainwreck of a person. Assuming you're all on one lease together, the remaining two tenants can pay the full rent to stave off an eviction, then sue the third, absconded roommate for what they owe. If there was no verbal or written agreement on how rent gets split, then perhaps you could use what she's paid in the past as a baseline for what you believe she owes for the months she refused to pay.
