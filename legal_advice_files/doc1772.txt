 My wife and I were assaulted on the Airbnb property we were staying at, and there are cameras covering the area it occurred. The lister/owner is refusing to help, saying he’d have to contact the security company and isn’t familiar with it, and wished me best of luck. So basically, a polite ‘fuck off’. I am a US citizen, the assaulter is also a US citizen, but this happened at a property in Central America. Do I have any recourse to getting a copy of the tape here? Am I out of luck? Thanks to any who reply. Airbnb has a team called Trust and Safety which is for these emergency situations. They'd be well-equipped to help you, I'd imagine. What country? What did the assault consist of? You are being way to vague to give any advice other than what has already been given (file a police report and alert Airbnb. You could try seeing if AirBnB customer service was willing to pressure the owner into providing the video. Otherwise you’ll need to work within the legal system of the country you were vacationing in. Thank you very much Call the police and report the assault, if they are interested in pressing charges they will subpoena the video evidence. You would need to report the crime and file all action in the country where this actually took places. Nothing is ever going to be happening here in the US, no.
