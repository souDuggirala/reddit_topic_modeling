 Panda express list the same calories for both a half order and a full order of a side and they list the calories for the smallest order of an item regardless of what you actually build in their online meal builder that shows calories. In other words it list the calories for a large a la carte order as the same as a small order. Their nutrition pdf also only list the smallest sized order and I could not find calories or sizes in oz for their larger sizes so it's impossible to calculate it unless you buy it, go home, weigh it, and calculate it manually. I'm assuming the fda is in charge of this but who exactly do I contact to complain? Is this something the fda would pursue? Did you go to the fda website? Can you call them?
