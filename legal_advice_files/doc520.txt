 i was involved in an auto accident where the other party involved was at fault, but when the insurance adjuster went over the claim they only found him 70% at fault? and they wont pay for fixing my vehicle or my hospital visit. is there anything i can do ?  You can ask your insurance company to try to work it out. The police officer doesn’t determine who is at fault for the insurance companies. They decide themselves. You can look into suing. But if both your insurance company and the other person’s insurance company think you share blame, it would be difficult to win.
