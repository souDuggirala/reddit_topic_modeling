 I texted my landlord that I would be moving out in 30 days and I will mail the written notice now. He said no, I have to move out later (2 days later than what I said). I think the reasoning is that I can only move out 30 days from when he receives the written notice. I feel he is squeezing 2 days out of me. Does this seem right? thanks OK but he's your landlord, not a cop. Film yourself attempting to give it to him, or leaving it in his mailbox or at his stoop or whatever.  [deleted] Does he live locally? Drive the letter over, sign it and date it with him, and bring a witness with you in case he refuses. Send a text followup and email followup afterwards for the paper trail. Save a copy of the letter.  You could email him.  Post-marked is usually enough. You are absolutely able to bring it to him in person in any jurisdiction I've ever seen. A written notice constitutes actual notice. If he wants to play hardball like that, he has the high ground, so you'll have to play along. 30 days is 30 days, essentially.
