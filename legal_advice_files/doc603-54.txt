About 2 years ago I joined a gym and surprise, surprise never really went. To pay for this, the gym was drafting from my debit card every month. Well that card was compromised and I have since gotten a new card. I have also moved to different town. I believe that I've met the time frame for which I'm allowed to cancel without paying anything extra. However, last time I tried to cancel they said I couldn't because I still had some time AND something about I also couldn't because even though I moved, they had another chain within 40 miles of my new city.  
Anyway, they have sent emails saying they couldn't draft my account anymore...but my question is, do I have to give them my new card info? Or can I just keep ignoring them? I don't think I gave them my social or anything, so I wouldn't think they could report me to a collection agency or anything...Plus they're saying I owe them like $200 in late fees which I'd like to avoid, also. Gyms are notorious for having really complicated cancellation procedures. You should follow their guidelines for cancellation, and then call/go in and do a 1 time payment for all the late dues/fees. If you do a 1 time charge for a very specific amount, then if they try to be scummy and put you back on auto-charge, you can do a chargeback (for any charges past what you agreed on). Removing the method of auto-payment does not release you of the liability for what you agreed to pay in the gym contract.

Read your contract for clauses that outline the specific cancellation procedure you must follow, then follow it.  Simply stopping paying when you're contractually obligated to pay is going to get you sued or sent to collections. Do not ignore these fees! Even without your social they can take your debt to collections. It would be better for you to just pay it. Not paying is not a good way to cancel a gym membership. Here are two sources that can give you more info:
