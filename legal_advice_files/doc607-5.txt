So,i edited a text message in messenger and sent it to someone else in order for them to fight with words but in the end the girl i sent it to said "i will tell my uncle who is a cop to make a complaint to police" but she doesnt know its edited.Is there a chance for me to get arrested? I live in greece if that helps,thanks for helping. To explain it better i edited the message that the first one is badmouthing the other and sent it to the other with fake account do i dont get revealed. But the girl i sent it to doesnt know its edited. Umm i changed the words of the first saying that not serious bad words to the other one. I don't get what your saying what exactly did you do?  I edited a message via html when u press right click on a message and press check option What do you mean u edited a message? I understand my mistake and i wont do it again but i want to know if its illegal oe not [removed] Quit doing dumb stuff on the internet and move on with your life.
