 I just got this postcard in the mail re: a class action lawsuit against Experian for the data breach awhile back. Is this legit or a scam? And should i do it if it’s legit?  Awesome. Thanks man! Oh yeah totally forgot. It's legit.  Anything info? I just received one as well. I work for a litigation company so I'm going to ask around The website looks legit but I didn’t want to rely on the website. Rather get 3rd party verification  Looks like a typical class action settlement card to me. It has the case number on it so you can research it some more to feel comfortable.
