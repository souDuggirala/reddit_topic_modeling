 Hi everyone, I am currenting working as a Recruitment Consultant at an Generalist Recruiting Agency. I'm underpaid, work long hours, have to pay for parking, and generally am not happy with my job. I've asked for a raise twice and both times have been denied. I have been offered a job as an Executive Recruiter at a Specialist Agency (specialising in the food industry). The job is closer, pays more, and has better benefits. I am extremely excited about this opportunity but I'm worried because I signed a vaguely worded non-compete clause when I first got my job one year ago. How enforceable are non-compete clauses? Any thoughts or suggestions? No one can answer without knowing where you are and what your non-compete says.
