 Last week I was in the process of closing on a house and received a missed call from my previous employer. With it being such a crazy week I did not return the call until today. I still have a good working relationship with my previous employer but we are in a very niche field and our businesses do compete with each other. My former employer informed me today after I returned his call that the mortgage lender had gotten his information confused with my current employer and sent him lots of personal information including my hourly rate salary and things of that nature. He said he called them and informed them they sent the information to the wrong employer and the mortgage lender quickly ended the conversation and hung up. I was never notified that this information was sent out and the mistake was made until I was able to speak to my old boss today. I am wondering what sort of action I should take in regards to the breach of private information and the lack of notification of such a mistake being made. thank you You should speak to your lender to hear their side of things and see if they'll give you anything by way of apology, and you should be careful with them in the future, but that's about it. You weren't damaged and it was an accident.
