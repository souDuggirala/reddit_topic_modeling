 Received a summons for credit card debt. I called them and got a stipulated judgment. Do I still need to answer the summons? I don't want to just ignore the summons. I'm not sure what to do next. I'm paying the debt I owe I just don't want anything bad to happen if I don't show up in court regarding the summons. Any help in this matter would be greatly helpful. Look for the docket. You should have a case number from the service. How would I find proof that the case is dismissed? Would I get something in the mail?  A stipulated judgment is a way of settling a case. The creditor should seek to dismiss the case based on your agreement. However, if you do not see proof that the case was dismissed by the date of the summons you should still go to court just to be safe.
