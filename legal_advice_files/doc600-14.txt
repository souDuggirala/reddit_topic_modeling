So if your children were the life tenants and you wanted the trust property to go to their kids when they died, would that work as a fixed o discretionary trust?

I can't really decide because on the one hand, it will be possible to construct a definitive list of the grandchildren when your children have died. But on the other hand, since you're not naming them and identifying them by a class, wouldn't that suggest that it's discretionary (ie by allowing your trustees to decide whether it's a GC or not)?
