 I moved from Illinois to Los Angeles county. The moving company is in Fairfax county Virginia. This moving company did $2200 in damages to my flooring and I'm trying to recover those losses. I've tried dealing with the moving company directly and I tried using the BBB, but I've failed on the recovery so far. I am now trying to open a court case against them. I'm trying to open the case here in LA county because this is where the damages occurred. However, the LA county small claims court is telling me that I can't open the case here since there is no agent to serve. Is there a way I can open the case in Fairfax county and then somehow get the case transferred here? Hiring a lawyer doesn't make sense since the amount of money is so low so I'm trying to handle this myself. That's a good idea I didn't think of to be honest. Perhaps contact your homeowners or renters insurance to see if they might be able to assist.
