 Hey /r/legaladvice. I could use your help with this if you would be so kind. So here are the facts... I work under the table and my employer doesn't offer health insurance. I just turned 26 so now I have to get my own plan for the next year. When I asked him about his plans to offer me health insurance or not, he said that it would be best for me to apply on healthcare.gov and to claim that I have no income. He says that I will get better coverage for less money this way. That sounds great... but I'm wondering what sort of blow-back I could expect from this if the government finds out I am lying? Can I get into a lot of trouble? Would he get into a lot of trouble? He says that his other employees do the same thing, but it just sounds sketchy to me. Thanks in advance for any and all advice! So you want to lie to the government in order to obtain something of value from them? Like commit fraud? It's not just sketchy, it's illegal, plus when you file your federal tax return, the government is plainly going to see that you do have income and charge you for all the health insurance you got for free... unless you're not claiming your income, which is also illegal. Well, considering that your employment situation already is illegal from his perspective this isn't surprising. No, do not commit insurance fraud. You really need to find a new job.
