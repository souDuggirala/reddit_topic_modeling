 This might not exactly be ‘sue-worthy’ but maybe I can take legal action? Last night, I went to my local Mcdonald’s and got a 10 piece chicken nuggets (which is actually surprising because I have refused to get them for years because I don’t trust them —clearly for a good reason). I ate a few of the nuggets before I uncovered, at the bottom, three parts of really burnt breading with blackish/brown in the middle. At first I dismissed them as really messed up nuggets, but then I got curious and started looking at them. I am not 100% sure (but I have no idea what else it would be), but I am almost positive that it was part of a cockroach. It wasn’t the actual body, more like the shell, so I’m not sure if it’s enough to go off of. I saved the pieces and put them in a baggie and I’m not sure what to do now. Is this even something worthy of suing? Is it too indefinite? Should I even waste my time? Thanks for the help! Yup, no damages, no case. Didn’t know that until now. Thank you! You’re right, I have no damages, thank you! You’re right, thank you! What are your damages? You're not going to be able to sue for millions just because you found what may or may not be a roach in your nuggets. You could go to them and ask for a refund for what you spent on the nuggets. They may throw in a few coupons as a customer service gesture. But you're not going to get rich off of this. Your only loss is the cost of the chicken nuggets so no it's not worth suing. You can report the "objects" to your local Mcdonalds and you might get a coupon out of it, but since I doubt they are what you think they are, you might as well go with - these bits of whatever were inedible so I'd like a refund. But frankly, who has the time?  I am sure they will be happy to refund you the amount you paid for the nuggets.
