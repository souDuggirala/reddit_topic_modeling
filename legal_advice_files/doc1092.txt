 So my friends sister (26f) contacted my little sister (17) to contribute to her charity where she personally sends school supplies to kids in Vietnam but required money for shipping. The thing is I know she always makes up sob stories to make people pity her and give her money. She also has pawned off my friends personal belongings as well as their parents without consent. Her own parents called the cops on her the a few days ago. So I don't trust her at all. I was not even aware she was contacting my sister from time to time. I know my sister and she would give without a thought. I don't know yet if my sister has sent her money but if she did, is there any laws against contacting/taking advantage of minors for money?  Kind of off topic, but I'm just curious. Why does your little sister have a friend a decade older than her? How would she even meet someone that much older? Part time job? Thanks for the reply! I'm looking into the charity in question because all I was given was a wix website  There are no laws against contacting minors for money. There are laws against scamming people or trying to scam people. If there is evidence of a scam, I suggest you take your little sister to the police to report what happened.
