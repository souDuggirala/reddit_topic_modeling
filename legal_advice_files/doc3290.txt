 I got the paperwork recently and my last name and the street name of the business are misspelled. Do I have to get them to fix it or is it not that big of a deal?  Ok cool. Yeah I have never had them make mistakes on my documents like that. Thank you for the advice.  Right on, thank you.  I had to do a name change earlier this year when I realized my accountant had misspelled a bunch of things on my application, I think it was around 80 bucks to change it all, Not a serious matter but do get it changed asap  You'll want to get it fixed so it doesn't potentially cause any issues down the road.
