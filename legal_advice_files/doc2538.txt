 Both of my husband's parents died in quick succession last year. After his dad died, his mom put their house (no mortgage) into a trust, with my husband (H) and his brother, who is a generally terrible person (T) as the trustees and beneficiaries. They also were named as co-executors of the will, and split everything half and half. Ten months of conflict between the brothers, unreasonable expectations and foot dragging by T have gone by. Not a single offer or even second look at the absurdly overpriced, completely dated house has come in. No one lives there. Systems are old and break down. We live 5 minutes away, T is almost an hour away and has a harder time getting out of work to deal with emergencies. A pipe broke and everything flooded two weeks ago. The saga of how terrible T had been to deal with is long and infuriating. H just wants to be done at this point. He left a message for our lawyer, who is off skiing until mid week next week. H just wants T to buy him out at half of fair market value. They each inherited enough money to make this entirely viable. H is even willing to set a price now, take some, and wait until T sells the house. (T wants to dump money into ridiculous things in hopes of getting the price he wants, which we believe is $70k more than it will actually sell for). T already said he wasn't wanting to buy H out, but he just generally says no to whatever H wants. Who knows if he'll come around. Just to give H hope until our lawyer gets home, which will hopefully give him enough calm that I don't have to worry about his having a heart attack or getting arrested for assault.... What's possible, legally, get H out of this at half of what the house is reasonably worth? Is he really stuck working with his obstructionist asshole brother until the house sells??
