 We bought a house in May of last year and our home inspector did not have a large enough ladder to get on our roof so our lender required that we get a roofing certification from the seller. The seller kept not producing this until finally bringing it to closing at which point if we did not accept it the whole sale may have fallen through. This was the 4th house we had an offer in on and had lost all the others so we went forward with it. The language in the roofing certification said that it was of the "opinion" of the roofer who did the roof that it would last 3-5 years but that this was not a "guarantee". It also came with a guarantee to make any repairs through April of this year. We had 4 different leaks over that time and it was a nightmare getting this roofer to come out as he seemed to be a single man operation with an LLC. In all of those instances he would "fix" the roof with little to no comment from us other than "it's done." In the last two weeks we had another leak in the same spot he had "fixed" and decided to call real roofers to come fix it this time. When they went up they discovered the terrible condition of our roof, showed us pictures, and let us know it would require a full replacement including replacing the wood supports. We had a second contractor come out to look at it who confirmed the same thing and we're even getting a third quote right now. My question is - do we have any legal recourse at all? It feels as if this roofer falsely certified the roof and at the very least should have let us know it needed significant repairs any of the 4 times he came to fix issues with his own work.
