 I don't know why there would be but here's the situation: I've found out that I various video games/video game consoles, and toys are fairly cheap in countries like Japan. The price of them + using shipping forwarders(for places that don't ship to America) is still very much under the price that the items go for on average. Is there any law against this? Just making sure. Or the overseas manufacturers didn't pay royalties to whoever created the game, they're just selling pirated copies. Its cheap for a reason, maybe duties or other taxes involved.
