 Iâ€™m sure there is a very simple answer to this question but I have absolutely zero experience with this sort of stuff. She was not injured from the accident but I wanted to know what steps to take to get compensation for the damages since insurance information could not be exchanged. Thank you for any answers! She will probably still have to pay her deductible, which her insurance company should then go after the other driver for and reimburse her if they are successful but this can take quite some time.  Ideally, she has full coverage or uninsured driver coverage and her insurance company pays for her damages. If not, then she will have to sue the driver as an individual and hope that he has enough means to pay what he owes her. She should go through her own insurance.
