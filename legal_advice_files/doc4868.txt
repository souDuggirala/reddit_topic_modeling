 Hi Reddit UK. I have an issue/question regarding the selling of my house. We have accepted an offer (3 weeks ago). The buyer wants to complete tomorrow. We have not signed a T1 (I think that's the forms name, final contract) we live 4 hrs drive away, hence selling. Our solicitor is going to email the T1 tomorrow for us to sign and scan, then they will hold the money from the sale until they receive the signed original (Monday or Tuesday), via post. Is this legal? Should we do this? The buyer is homeless as of tomorrow which is the case of the rush. Also buyer is insisting on us taking out indemnity on the septic tank and for not having the original ground lease from 1930s around Â£300. I know I have a solicitor that I pay for advise I'm just after a second opinion on what you would do. Also they have been rubbish and slow hence the crazy deadline. I know we have a couple of options, Let it go this way. Refuse to rush (buyer pulls out of sale, which I doubt as they will be homeless). Skip jobs tomorrow to drive up. What would you do?  Thanks for your advise, that's why we didn't want to short let it to them before the completion. r/legaladviceuk may be better equipped for this. Here - _not_ the UK - allowing a buyer to take possession prior to closing is often viewed as a very risky move, because it takes an eviction to get them out again if the deal falls through and they refuse to vacate voluntarily. In a situation like this I'd be talking about either holding firm, or offering to help cover a cheap hotel room for the weekend instead, to limit the risk. I wouldn't make any snap decisions on this without talking to your solicitor, though.
