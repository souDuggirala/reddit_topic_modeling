 Last May, I mistakenly had a medical procedure done at a facility that was out of network. Everyone involved in the process, including my doctor, the facility, and my insurance company, indicated it was in network prior to the procedure. After I disputed it, the insurance company investigation came out on my side and they agreed to treat it as in network and pay the claim. As part of that process I got a statement from the facility showing the $3,000 we paid up front and a $2,000 early payment credit, leaving our total owed them at zero. The insurance company cut us a check for $3,000 and I thought I was done. However, we filed a better business bureau complaint against the facility (this was not the only office to lie to us about their insurance policy) and after that was resolved, that $2,000 ceased to be forgiven and we started getting bills. Every time I got a bill, I followed up with the insurance company who always said they were working on it. However, now we have gotten a letter that it's going to collections. Supposedly the insurance company is still working on it, but I have little faith it will get it resolved in the next 30 days. What are my options here? Would the original statement showing that we had a zero balance for the procedure be enough to dispute the validity of the claim?
