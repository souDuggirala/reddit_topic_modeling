 Hello, I’m 5 months pregnant and I work as a bartender. I usually work from 10:30-11:30 every Friday and Saturday and have been for the past year. My employer recently changed my schedule and switched me to only 10:30-4... I confronted them and asked for my normal schedule back and was told that they didn’t want “double to be too much for me.” I told them that they weren’t, and my obgyn said that I could continue work as normal. I tried to pick up an evening shift and was denied. I was also told that they didn’t want me to get “emotional for no reason.” Is this illegal? I am livid. I have never once complained about working a double bar shift.  They honestly may not like the optics of a pregnant woman behind the bar. I could see how they want the bartender to look like a fun person the customers would want to drink with. I’m guessing that’s part of it if they won’t let you pick up an evening shift on another day when you don’t already work 10:30-4. Unfortunately this is completely legal. They can’t fire you for being pregnant but they CAN hide you from their customers during their busiest hours.  They only lowered her hours on two days, it’s unclear of how her total hours are affected. If she wasn’t full-time or quite close before that though then I doubt it.  Could this be considered constructive dismissal if the reduced hours and lower resulting pay forced OP to quit? Sexism at its finest. Depending on where you live though this is most likely not illegal unless your boss were to fire you for being pregnant. I would try talking with him again with a note from your OB saying you are fully capable of working the other shift.
