 I'm not yet 18, however, when I turn 18 I very much do plan to carry a firearm, concealed or not. I would prefer to be able to carry concealed, however. I live in North Carolina, a state which issues CCW licenses at age 21+. The state does, however, provide reciprocity with many states, one of which is Utah. Utah issues provisional CCW licenses at the age of 18. As far as I can tell, the provisional licenses follow the same guidelines as the regular ones, including out-of-state application. Could I apply for a Utah CCW permit and use North Carolina's reciprocity laws to lawfully conceal a firearm? It would appear that would work. Okay. Follow up to that, then. Maine appears to also have reciprocity with North Carolina ([]()). Looking over Maine's CCW application, a "home-state" permit doesn't seem to be required. The CFP booklet ([%20Booklet.pdf](%20Booklet.pdf)) as well as the application ([]()) both appear to require listing any possible previous permits, but don't explicitly say that a current "in-state" permit is required. No. In order to apply for a non-resident permit, provisional of otherwise, you must have a permit in your home state.  No, Utah does not require that you have a permit in your home state.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that for a state to issue a non-resident conceal permit you would have to first get one from your state of residence and submit a copy. But that would be for you to conceal carry in Utah while maintaining your NC residence. In your case you would have to become a resident of Utah to get their conceal permit.
