 So this morning I woke up to all four of my cars tires being slashed and mirrors broken. I want to leave the apartment complex now as I have no reason to stay any longer but my lease isn’t up yet. I was wondering would this fall under fire and casualty damage so I would be able to cancel my lease? (Fire): slashes tire haha no one will believe him No unless that’s what happened it doesn’t fall under fire damages Unless somehow a fire slashed your tires, then no  No.
