 Hey there, so I have a turkish father and an austrian mother who gave me the name 'X-Y'. Now, because of personal reasons, I want to have the X removed and officially only be called Y. I went to the local authorities to request my first Name to be changed. After checking my request for compability with the law, they rejected me: "according to (…) a first Name change may not be granted if the requested forename is not common (…) I was called Y since my birth, all my Friends, my mother, boss, everyone calls me Lemilia. That should count for something? Note: My birth certificate only says X, not the double Name (my Drivers License however has listed both), I guess that makes it a bit harder. Also the Name doesn't have to be common in Austria, just anywhere in the world. After some research I found that the Name really isn't common anywhere, though I found some People online called Y from all over the world (I might try to argue that way) But what I dont understand is that a first Name Change has to be common, I mean a mother can Name their child whatever they want at birth (obviously silly/illegal names aside) so why does my Name have to be used by others? I'm based in Austria, so there might not be a lot of you here familiar with my law System, but as far as I understand, law is much about arguing the right way, so I kindly ask for some suggestions and ideas of yours on how I could approach that case. Any Input is gladly appreciated! Thanks :) TL;DR: Title  it might be the name my father gave me, but I am and definitely don't want to be called by that damn it, thanks  If your birth certificate only says "X", then that is your name. Why would the driver's license list something other than the "official" name. I assume "X" is what you want to be called. I believe you accidentally left your real name in your post. You may want to edit.
