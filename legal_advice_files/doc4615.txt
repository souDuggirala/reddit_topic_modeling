 Hi I'm 22M and I've been trying to pay my rent since the beginning of November. It is now Nov. 26. I chose for my apt to take from a new bank account but it has charged the wrong account and overdrawn that account. This has happened 3 times since the first payment and I'm tired of it. Im also military, idk if that has any bearing but I figured having access to a JAG lawyer might be useful. What can I do to ensure they pay back all the overdraft fees they incurred or something similar? Im not letting them mess my credit up and get paid. That's not an option. Thank you. Did you fill out a paper form indicating the account you wanted the funds taken out of? There’s no way they’d know your other account number to intentionally use that account instead of the one you wanted unless you provided that number to them. I’d call whomever handles the payments for your apartment and ask for proof that you opted for the correct account. I’d also recommend setting up overdraft protection between your accounts so that you won’t incur overdrafts in the future.
