 I'm not concerned about being deported, just it causes issues with hiring. I underwent a legal name change recently and last week went off my information to get my passport updated. Yesterday I interviewed for a job that I could get early next week. Unfortunately, my passport, birth certificate, and Social Security card are currently in the possession of the U.S. government while they process the change. I have COPIES of my birth certificate and social security card right now, but don't expect to get my actual ones that soon. The job was not planned so I did not prepare for this. I'm concerned they'll pass me up because I can't start until this is verified or would this be some sort of extenuating circumstance? That's...less than useful, because it's not gonna be certified I think. Depending on what the job is, they may be able to wait for you. Obviously, you'll have better odds if you have a shorter wait with a more concrete time. You may be able to try contacting your birth state's vital records office, who can get you a certified birth certificate. That plus the driver's license is enough for the I-9, and the state may be faster than the feds about this one. The post office gave them to me when I went in to submit it all.  One detail--are your copies of these documents certified copies from the government, or DIY home jobs? A certified copy of the birth certificate plus driver's license would work fine. For your employer to avoid potential liability for civil penalties, you and your employer must complete the I-9 process (which means [showing original documents or receipts for replacements]()) within 3 days of beginning employment. There is no "extenuating circumstance" exception for that. Any other ID policy is that of your employer's and for them to decide. I have that as well.  Why wouldn't you simply furnish copies of the legal documentation ordering your name change to the employer along with the out of date documentation?
