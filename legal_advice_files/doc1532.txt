 (ON, Canada) If there is someone harassing me (trying to pick a fight for absolutely no reason/they're drunk) and I respond to them: "you need to either shut the fuck up, or go on and hit me so I can sue your ass", and they proceed to physically assault me, is this actually grounds for me to sue them for money? Correct. You can report them to the police. You can’t sue if you don’t have any monetary damages. Or rather you can but you won’t win.  Emotional distress. So I couldnt sue the person for money just because they committed a crime against me? All that would happen to them is jail time? Do you have monetary damages? I feel like researching this very thing would’ve been step one in this whole plan of yours.
