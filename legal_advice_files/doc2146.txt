 I was crossing the cross walk when a car ran a stop sign, accelerated and swerved so it almost hit my wife and I. Panicked, we walked to another street. The car then went down the second street with the passenger hanging both hands out the window with an aggressive “what are you going to do about it” stance. We immediately went to the police station with a picture of the car and license plate. We also told them there were two cameras at that corner that captured the whole thing. They pretty much laughed at us and said if they didn’t see it themselves there is nothing they can do about it. Is this legal or are they just being lazy? People run stop signs all the time in my neighborhood. Someone will be seriously hurt soon. I also know there were witnesses.  It is more of a policy because it is hard for them to prosecute if cops didn't witness it. They don't want to waste their time pulling tapes for it. I rephrased. My question wasn’t meant to be about the cops breaking the law. It’s about their authority to act if they didn’t witness it but there are cameras, other witnesses and I have the license plate. They told me they weren’t allowed to do anything. Perfectly legal I suppose they could have given a charge of reckless driving if they had been there. More often, in my experience, police put their resources in persecuting rather than preventing crimes, and they generally determine on their own what to follow up on. If that is frequent in that area, you can call the police (non-emergency line) and if it's a slow day they might send a car to sit there and watch the corner.  You can try to escalate the issue, but you can't force the police to act.
