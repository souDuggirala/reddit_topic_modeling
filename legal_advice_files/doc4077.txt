 My 71 yr old father has married a woman who has estranged him from the rest of his family. We the kids havenâ€™t talked to him in over two years. We do know that she is stripping his assets an moving them to Canada. We also know that his mental health is failing and that he will end up needing care. None of us want anything to do with it. We warned him years ago this would happen, he left our mom to pursue this craziness. So, once this woman leaves him high and dry, is there anyway the state or whomever can make us pay for his care? Thank you! Stuff like this needs their own subreddit She's fine too. There are three kinds of states with regards to filial responsibility laws: states that have no such laws whatsoever (like TX), states that have laws but which are rarely enforced or are structured so that they would rarely come into play (like CA), and a few states where the laws do actually get enforced on rare occasions (PA, maybe OH). We are all inTX but my sister lives in CA. If your father also lives in Texas, then you are fine. Texas has no 'filial responsibility' laws on the books. If he lives in another state, the answer is 'maybe'. Yes, aka buttfuck Texas. On the Moon, if your father winds up destitute you're obligated to take him in but you can make him act as your personal butler. Are you on the Moon?
