 On Oct of 2018, I received a letter to MY NAME to file the I-751 prior to the expiration of my Condition 2-year green card that ends in January of 2019. I'm 19 years old. I got my green card from my stepdad who is a US Citizen, that is married to my mother. Thus, we filled the petition. But just TODAY I realized that my 2-year green card said that I'm a resident since 01/30/2017 and expired on 01/30/2019. But my mother her green card said that she is a resident since 11/28/2017 and will expire on 11/28/2019. So, it was way too early for filling on my mother's case. But not on my end. Why did we get a different date anyway? The questions are: 1. Why are the starting for me and my mother different? 2. We filled the petition anyway and the website said that to file 90 days prior to the expiration. What is going to happen? Are they going to wait up to 3 months to my mother green card's expiration? Or will they process it as soon as they get it but just for me and wait for my mother's? 3. Should I contact a lawyer? Thank you in advance
