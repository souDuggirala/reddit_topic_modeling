 A few years ago I was arrested. As a result I did a diversion and my charge was later dropped and my arrest was expunged, but to be honest as most people see it as beneficial I view it as a waste of time and a very unhelpful. People tell me I should be glad that the judge didn’t throw in jail and think nothing of it, but honestly I’m ungrateful that was what I ended up getting. Is doing diversion a waste of time? [removed] This may be better suited for r/legaladviceofftopic since this is something in the past and a general legal question. Well it was wasted considering your lack of appreciation for the deal you got. I don't think you have a clue what it's like getting a job or applying to college with a criminal record. It's not supposed to be a fun experience for you, it's supposed to give you an opportunity to live your life without bearing the weight of your own past behavior, as long as you learn and modify your behavior.
