I'm in the final semester of my college career and have already landed a full time job in Texas. I also applied for my citizenship about 6 months ago and am currently getting processed. A month ago I was stopped for speeding and was caught with unprescribed adderall on me. I gave the officer consent to search and told him where it was and because of this he decided not to arrest me and instead gave me a paraphernalia ticket which I understand is a class c misdemeanor in Texas. I have since gotten an attorney but they were unable to get the ticket dismissed. I am now looking to do deferred adjudication to have it removed from my record, but I understand this still makes me eligible for deportation. As someone who has been in this country nearly my entire life I am pretty terrified of being deported. I made some very stupid decisions and have since learned my lesson. How likely is it that the government will build a case against me to deport me?
