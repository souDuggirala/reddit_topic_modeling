 I'll try and keep this as simple as possible, but my cousin and his wife have a lease until May 1st. They are moving into a house on March 1st and the rental company for his current apartment and him have been trying to find somebody to take over the lease. His Rental company found someone and approved them and told him they were going to move in on the 7th after they did routine cleaning on his place after they moved out. He is still required to pay March's rent but it will be prorated back to him from the 7th and beyond. Well, that person just cancelled at the last minute just now after being approved and agreeing to move in for over a month. The Company is telling my cousin that he is liable for the rent until he can find someone else to take over the lease all the way up until the end lease date of May 1st. So basically he has to pay double rent at both places. I'm pretty sure he has no legal options here at all, but I didn't think it would hurt to ask and find out.  No worries. Best of luck to him. This is what I told him but he thought he had other options so I told him I would post it here to see. Thank you for the response  You are correct. He is liable for the rent at his current place until the end of his lease, unless he or the apartment company can find someone to take over the lease. That he has to double-pay is unfortunate, but not illegal.
