 So I broke my wrist and have requested fmla through work. Submitted request immediately and doc filled out the papers. Leave was approved BUT for about three weeks shorter then what the doctors requested and was told I would hav ego recertify three weeks into the leave. Is that legal? What will the time difference mean for you? All the proper forms have been filled out. I spoke to my advocate and when I asked why the difference she simply said because that’s what we approved then stated if I needed longer I would have to recertify. I will be calling back again on Tuesday as they are not available on Monday due to the holiday but I can’t see how they can override the date my doctor requested with no clear reason.  Contact your leave of absence advocate and ask why. In the meantime you can complete this form for your employer. I was asked to complete it when my employer thought my STD plan wasn't going to approve my leave. Please understand, FMLA isn't paid leave.
