[removed] And we’re done. Thanks for stopping by, OP.  Yeah, because this virtue signaling fucking cult member is more interested in a pronoun - a sufficient one for any animal 10 and under - than the fact that a child is crawling on its hands and knees for dollar bills on the floor men were ejaculating on 24 hours prior.

 Well that escalated quickly.  Shut the fuck up I think it does actually violate child labout laws in NY I don't know why you are referring to the child as "it" but in any case it looks like the 3am part may be an issue. You can call the state department of labour if you're concerned. 

Edit: [here](https://labor.ny.gov/formsdocs/wp/LS559.pdf) is some general info on regs for child performers in your state.  “It?” Weird pronoun choice  If you think a crime was committed I'd encourage you to report it to the police and have them sort it out.
