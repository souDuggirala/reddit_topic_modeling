 10k and Iâ€™m in Texas Thank you!! This helps A LOT! If you can't afford to pay the credit card, you likely can't afford to pay a lawyer to represent you. You MUST answer the complaint whatever you do. You may be able to reach some agreement with them, but you need to do that much regardless of what they say or the actions they take. You don't want to risk getting a default judgment. You have 30 days from the receipt of the complaint to answer it. You need to answer each paragraph. A paragraph is each individually numbered sentence. There are three ways in which you can answer a paragraph: (1) admit it, (2) deny it, (3) or you can lack the information sufficient enough to admit or deny it. You can answer part of a paragraph with (1),(2), or (3), and you can answer the remaining with another variation of (1), (2), (3), meaning you can afirm in part, deny in part, and lack sufficient knowledge in part. If you answer with (3), it serves as a denial for the purposes of the answer. If you admit something, it is deem as fact for the rest of the case. Once you've fully answered the complaint, you need to file your answer in the court from which the summons and complaint came from. Then you need send a filed copy to the Plaintiff's attorney.  How much are we talking about here and what state are you in? You can reach out to them and become current on your credit card, and then they can drop the suit. What's the value of the debt and what's your location?
