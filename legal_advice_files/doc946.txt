 I understand that PooPrints works by taking a sample of our pets DNA and then if there are droppings found on the property, the droppings are sent out and PooPrints references their database to determine who's dog committed the "horrible atrocity". Our issue is, my apartment complex has restrictions on some breeds of dogs (Rottweilers, Dobermans, Shepards, and Pittbulls to name a few), and the dog we are looking at adopting is under a "Lab Mix", and we don't know what said mix is. He does not look like a restricted breed, but who knows when you are adopting. Our question is, does PooPrints communicate the dog breed at all with our apartment complex? We really do not want to have our dog driven up here from Tennessee just to have him taken away from us if they find out that his mix is of a restricted breed. Thanks for the reply! Great, thanks for the help! Dog DNA can't conclusively prove breed even when we want it to. The various DNA my dog services just compare the dogs DNA to various confirmed pedigree dogs and look for similarities. You can send 2 samples from the same dog and get different results.  The question you should be asking is "Can recreational genetic testing accurately reveal the breed of my pet dog?" The answer to that question is no.
