 I’m in the US and I believe I got a cannabis warning. I was in the back seat of a car and we got pulled over for speeding. When the cops pulled us over they smelled marijuana and asked to search the vehicle. They searched it and found only a roach and a pipe. I don’t smoke but the person who was driving smoked in their car before they picked me up. We complied with what they said and were honest. After giving are IDs they came back and said “ For being honest with us we are just giving you a warning and charging you for the speeding ticket.” They took the roach and the pipe and we were on our way. I didn’t get any papers or have to sign anything. If I get get a Cannabis warning do they go on your record? You're being way too paranoid. When the officer writes a ticket they give you a copy of it. That's how it gets recorded.  Is that how it works for Cannabis warnings? I’m under the impression that they tell you about it then make note of it on their end that they gave you a warning. When the police said “just giving you a warning for it” I’m under the impression it’s a verbal citation? If you weren't issued a citation of any kind there is no reason to believe that there will be any record of the incident.
