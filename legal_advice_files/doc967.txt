 Let me explain, because the title sounds a bit silly. I used to work full time for a company on an hourly basis where they had a policy that anyone working greater than 35 hours a week could qualify for health insurance. I took advantage of this for awhile and then got a new job, salaried, and only stayed on my old position for 1-2 shifts per week. Because the income was mostly inconsequential and direct deposited I never looked at my pay stubs, but they continued to charge me for health insurance even though I had it through my full time employer --not to mention was ineligible by their own standards. I like these people and don't want to cause too much trouble, but what can I reasonably ask for in terms of reimbursement? Should i be looking to recoup those payments deducted from my checks despite not needing/qualifying for their insurance?  No, but yes if you informed them you didnâ€™t need health insurance through their company anymore.
