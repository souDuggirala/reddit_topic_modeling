 So long story short a craigslist mechanic did not finish my car on time, then made the car inoperable and finally stole parts from the car and sabotaged it to where the auto shop its currently at has no way of knowing if the engine is working after they put it back together, he made threats via text message that he would destroy the car The police have and continue to say its still a civil matter I do have a signed contract stating that the car would be done on X date This occurred in WA and i now live in CA, the initial estimate would be around $5k, and i highly doubt that this person would ever pay even if i wont, so i want to make sure he doesnt get away with it free and clear I am a disabled vet and i receive disability so im basically retired and have lots of time to learn and perform some of the tasks on my own I did however want to avoid traveling back to WA to file, aside from hiring an attorney is there another type of position that would allow me to hire them to file for me and then i would appear on the court date? After the judgment, i understand it will go on his credit report, he was working on the car at a place that his parent was renting, i already filed complaints since he was improperly using the property, my understanding is he has now moved to a different city, his age is around late 20s or in his 30s, if he does not pay can i keep extending it so that it will come off his social security? So i need to locate his new place of residence, i dont know if he had a regular job aside from working on cars from home, i feel that spending a total of $2k would be worth it to ensure he is punished and again i realize i may not get any money
