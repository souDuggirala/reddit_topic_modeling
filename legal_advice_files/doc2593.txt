 Hi r/legaldvice! Long time lurker here, who finally needs to make a post to ask for advice; the issue is that a different drug (antibiotic) was handed to us by the (major chain, Virginia) pharmacy than was prescribed by the doctor. The name of the drug is very similar, but it is a different drug. The child (12) who took was immediately ill and incapacitated for 4-5 days with higher fever, vomiting and migraine. Speaking to the pharmacy today (on tape) they admitted 100% fault and also admit to process breakdown at two key steps - first being manual keying in from the electronic Rx to their systems and second being pharmacist verification that the drug handed to us was as ordered b the doctor. I am understandably furious and want to make sure that underlying processes are remediated to take this into account. Can anyone comment on the legal issues at play here? Thanks! Contact a medical malpractice lawyer. Sounds like you've come into some money. Make a complaint to the pharmacy board Complaints: (800) 533-1560 Email: pharmbd@dhp.virginia.gov This starts the process of disciplinary hearings for the pharmacist and the techs. Then you need to assess damages by talking to a med-mal attorney to see if there is any value in a lawsuit for damages Additionally, notify the corporate entity of the situation.  This is understandably concerning, but what are your damages? Did your child recover?
