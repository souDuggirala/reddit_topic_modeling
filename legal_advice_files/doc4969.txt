 Long story short, I've been with this financial institution for about 2 months, during the time I was never written up, disciplined or anything of the sort. I was never told my performance was lacking, never given anything to sign regarding my actual work performance or told anything. I was given tasks verbally and completed everything I needed to. Fast forward to last friday I was told I was going to be let go because I'm not a happy, jovial, social butterfly that's needed to represent the face of the company. I literally was told I don't socialize enough. I was also told that I shouldn't be speaking to two certain employees when seeking help on certain things because those employees are negative and have nothing worthwhile to say. I didn't figure or refute or sign anything on my release other than I gave back all company property. Is there any recourse I can take legally regarding this? This is in Miami, FL btw.  There is nothing illegal here. File for unemployment and start looking for a new job. Not illegal.

File for unemployment. When you say employment contract, do you mean job description? That is the only thing I signed. No where in that does it say I needed to perform the functions of a Disney greeter while on the job. You can file for unemployment and look for a new job. no, nothing illegal occurred. file for unemployment and look for a new job Unless you had an employment contract that specifically prohibited your company from firing you for this, they can fire you for it. You don't have any recourse.
