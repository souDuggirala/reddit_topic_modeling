So my wife and I may be heading for a divorce, hope not buy maybe, and she wants to buy this house with money from the sale of a previous house that I, seeing the trouble we're in, am reluctant to go in on.  After wrangling about on this issue, we have come up with the solution to divide the money we made on the last house, she would use her part on the new one, and I would forsake claim on it with a partition agreement, and on top of that, at my behest really, we want to go ahead and separate our bank accounts and retirement programs so each will be in full, single possession of his own accounts.  Nobody is getting screwed in this.  The assets are similar.  Now I haven't done anything like this before.  I sat down with one lawyer and for $275 consultation, she said she could do it for 5,000, while a quick free phone consultation with a "Divorces-R-Us" attorney, I was quoted $750.  I'm balking at $5000, but $750?  I'm completely confused.  Is it possible that this is a boilerplate agreement that in reality doesn't take much work, and the first attorney was milking it, or do I need to pay more for an agreement that will actually stand up in court?
