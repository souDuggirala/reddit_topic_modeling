 Hi, redditors. I was hoping if I can get any help about false charges. My dad is a pastor and he is doing his service at Suwon, South Korea. Unfortunately there are some people at dad's church who want to get rid of him because they are accused of embezzling church property. My father was framed as a fraud and he was proven innocent by the court. Still they keep accusing him for the same charge with the same evidence. The problem is, the police are doing a biased investigation. To be specific, the people who are trying to get rid of my dad are assulting other people by twisting their wrist, touching the private parts, insulting, the list goes on. However the police station who investigates those cases never charged them. Instead, the people who acted for their self defence was charged of assult. The reason of those charges are slightly pushing, and by slightly pushing, it is a push that nobody was falled down. Does anyone had these kinds of experience? If you had, please will you help me?
