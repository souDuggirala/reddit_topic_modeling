 So our neighbors behind us have a playset for their kids that has gravel all around it. The gravel was held in my a couple of pieces of wood which have now knocked over. So all of the gravel and rocks are spilling into our yard. All the water that comes from their yard bc of the landscaping mess has corroded our fence and there is a giant hole in the ground where water has just washed away our land. Our fence is going fall over at any time. We finally talked the neighbor into calling his insurance and they sent an engineer out to look at it. They came to the conclusion that none of his landscaping crap has caused our yard damage. They said there is nothing they can or will do. Is there any legal avenue we can take? Our fence falling over is absolutely caused from their landscaping. We are at a loss for what to do and we donâ€™t have thousands and thousands of dollars sitting around to get a new fence. Help please!!  You can sue over your losses. Though one wonders whether your losses really are "thousands and thousands of dollars." And whether you can establish the neighbor's liability. There are some circumstances that could leave your neighbor liable for your losses. Those circumstances aren't universal, and apparently the insurance company decided they don't exist. That doesn't mean that they don't. But insurance companies make more money by paying righteous claims than by litigating and losing. So it perhaps can't be dismissed either. Even if you prevail in establishing your neighbor has liability, your damages are likely limited to the lesser of the depreciated fair market value of the fence or the cost to repair. So if you have a $5,000 fence that is 8 years through a 10 year life, you probably couldn't recover more than $1,000. If you are facing thousands and thousands you should likely involve your own insurance company.
