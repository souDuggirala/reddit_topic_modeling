 The valet at a large transportation hub in Houston, TX, wrecked my car. The body shop sent me an estimate of at least $8k. Their insurance appraiser went out and said it should cost $6500. I called the body shop, and they said that they told the appraiser that they disagreed with that price and expected it to cost more. The Release of all claims says that if I accept the $6500 check and sign the release it is a "Full and Final Release," but it also says that if extra damage is found during the repair process relating to this same incident, a separate check will be mailed directly to the body shop. Is this customary? I'm hesitant to sign.  Get multiple appraisals to strengthen your case. Do not sign anything that is a release of claims until the car is repaired to your satisfaction.
