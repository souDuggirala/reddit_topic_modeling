 So basically I live in Washington, and I get paid every 6th. Super weird date I know it should be on the 1st, idk why my job is like this. Well I’ve had people telling me left and right that I have 5 days to pay the rent and then AFTER those 5 days I should be getting charged the late fee. How true is this, if it even is true... Sincerely, a broke laundryman Ask for a copy. The date on which rent is due and any grace periods you have or late fees should be spelled out in the lease, and the legally-binding lease is what this is all going to come down to. Yes but I lost the copy long ago You're welcome.. Shitty snafu, but maybe ask them if they can talk to the owner about changing your due date to the 6th. Or put it in writing and ask owner yourself. I'd bet if you asked to do it for a few months to put enough money back to pay a month ahead, they would. Do you have a written, fixed-term lease? Thanks man but yeah just wanted help confirming a shitty situation as such Ahh, I see. If that's what it is, that's what it is. Do you know someone that could loan you the next month's rent, so you could get a month ahead, then paying on the fifth would be early, and you could pay back someone like $50 a month? If I wasn't penniless and destitute myself, I'd totally help you get on a month ahead schedule. Well the thing is I did ask.. the first month we rented we asked if we could be able to pay the 5th and she said that’s fine but that a late fee would have to be charged. This is the manager saying this not the actual owners of the apartment complex. I’m paying 59$ in late fees.. like I said I’m a broke dude and could really use that money for like bathroom amenities, kitchen soap.. Pretty sure you should be asking your landlord this. They will likely make arrangements to allow you to pay on the 6th... most human beings are relatively reasonable. What does your lease agreement say?
