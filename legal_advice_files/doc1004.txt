 I am an Illinois resident with an IL drivers license. I received a first offense OWI (DUI) in Wisconsin. In WI a first offense is a traffic ticket, not criminal. For a WI resident you’d typically have a license suspended for 6 months and pay a fine. In IL it’s a misdemeanor and has a one year revocation. You also need to go to a hearing after the time is up to get your license reinstated. You can get a restricted license at conviction, and if you hold it for nine months you can then try for full reinstatement. I know that IL eventually finds out about the OWI via the national driver database. I’ve been told that at that point they’d revoke my IL license as if I got the conviction in IL. Would it be possible to just voluntarily cancel my IL drivers license to prevent it being an issue in IL? Or because I’m a resident and it was written against my IL license that that wouldn’t matter? Yeah that’s what I’m going to have to do I guess You can probably get either a WI or IL Occupational license. Look it up. No that won't work. Your driving privileges will still be suspended. You don't need to have an active/valid license for this to happen. You did not find the one cool trick. Canceling you license will not stop Illinois from revoking or suspending it if that’s something they’re going to do.
