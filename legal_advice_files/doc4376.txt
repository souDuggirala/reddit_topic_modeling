 Hello, I work at the kitchen of a university in Denton, TX, and have since Oct. 29th, after leaving a job I'd worked since June of last year (if that matters). We got letters notifying us the kitchen would be closed from Dec. 14th to Jan. 6th, and have been encouraged to file for temporary unemployment. I was wondering if I could file now so my benefits would be set up ahead of time and I wouldn't have to worry about filing during the break? Not trying to double dip and get unemployment while still working, just wondering if I could file now for unemployment for the time I'll be off work later so it'll be ready to go when the break begins. Also, since I've only worked their for a little over a month, will I have to file for unemployment based off of pay from my last job? I'm worried because I worked are part time split shift that varied a lot in hours, so I'm not sure what they'd count as my salary. Thank you too any and all posters, have a great day and Happy Holidays!
