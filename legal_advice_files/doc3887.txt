 I live in Florida. My roommate and I submitted $100 each for background/employment checks alongside our applications to rent an apartment, and then paid the security deposit. After our realtor dropped off our applications with the HOA, she was informed that the management company had changed the month previously, and the fee was now $300 per applicant. Apparently, we had the “old forms.” We contacted the listing agent, who hadn’t been informed of the fee changing. I’m guessing we’re shit out of luck and will have to eat $400 more in fees if we want the place, which we do. I’m also guessing there is not a limit on the maximum we can be charged, but the price seems exorbitant and I’m just wondering if we have any options here as far as getting the fee minimized or waived. Any advice or relevant info is appreciated! Florida has no statutory limits on application fees for rentals. What do you mean that you already paid the security deposit? Did you sign a lease already? The landlord cannot just change what is needed after a lease is signed.  It sounds pretty high and I wouldn't pay that, but maybe it's not that unusual for your area. This isn't really a legal question, but you could try asking them if they'll waive or reduce the fee. Worst that can happen is they say no
