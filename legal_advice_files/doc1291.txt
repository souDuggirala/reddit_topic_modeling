 My ex is pregnant with my son. She ended up running off to Florida to be with some other guy she dated back in middle school who is fresh out of rehab. They have been together for 3 weeks and they both sent me messages acknowledging that the kid is mine but they told me that he is going to be signing the birth certificate and she is giving my son his last name.  “Paternity fraud” isn’t really such a thing. It doesn’t matter whom signs the birth certificate. If your not married. The child has no “legal” father. If they decided to get married you need to step up. Because in some states any child that isn’t “legal” becomes the fathers responsibility. Once the child is born you need to figure out where she resides (peacefully) and go to the court house and file for custody or visitation. The man who did this simply can’t legally say this is my kid now. You have rights but it’s gonna be fun to establish them. Find a lawyer and possible a private investigator or be nice to the baby mama and then slam her with legal documents all at once out of the blue. Some off topic legal advice from experience, fresh out of rehab says to me he will be doing drugs eventually. Once the baby is born, call child protective services and say your concerned for the physical well being of your child. :). It works  Save those messages in multiple places and formats.  There is no action to take for "paternity fraud." You can file after the child is born to establish paternity, and set visitation and child support. You will need an attorney in the state and county where she is located at the time. You can file a lawsuit for paternity and custody in the state the child is born in. I highly recommend an attorney for such an action.
