 Alright..... where to begin.... me and a few buddies just finished eating lunch and made it around to the front of the front of the school (outside) and were just standing around talking. When 2 geese walk up to us, yes... geese... okay so we continue on just talking minding our own business when the vice principal comes over and yells at us to "Stop harassing the geese" now of course we are confused as can be and try to explain how they walked up to us and we didnt do anything to us but no he takes us to the office threatens to suspend us and search us ect. We call his bs and eventually get back to class. So overall I just want to know my rights about being searched at a public school. USA Colorado  That's what I thought You can be searched, you dont have a right to privacy on campus.
