 The dryer broke in our duplex and i texted my landlord and he said “feel free to fix or replace it. I am not responsible for washer or dryer” The dryer was old. We didnt bring the dryer. It was included the duplex and is shared by us, the upper unit, and the lower unit. Who is responsible? It's generally the opposite. Unless the lease specifies who's responsible for the fixtures, it defaults to the landlord. I'm sure most leases don't specify the use of a fridge or washing machine in the rent, but you'd certainly hold the landlord responsible to fix them if they broke. The complication here is that it's a commonly shared appliance and the landlord could easily say he never provided the dryer, doesn't know who's it is, and has no intention of replacing it, which it sounds like he's doing and relieves him of responsibility for it. Used dryers are cheap and fixing dryers is normally really easy for anyone with a screwdriver. If it's turning but not heating, 99% of the time it's either the thermal fuse or heating element (electric) or the gas igniter (gas). No, you wouldn't be responsible for replacing it. But your landlord doesn't have to provide you with one, either. And we are not responsible for replacing it? Then they aren't included in your rent. So your landlord has no obligation to provide you with a working washer or dryer.  It does not specifically mention either of them in the lease  What does your lease say about whether the use of a washer and dryer are included in your rent?
