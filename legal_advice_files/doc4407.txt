 People I know are using my photos information etc on the gay dating app Grindr. They’ve publicly given my phone number and address out. To the point people are turning up at my house for sex. What can I do? As a tech savy person, i can tell you this will not fix it. Most people involved in this type of activity use vpn's. They can ban the account and ip, but all said user has to do is select a new vpn and they are back in buisness. Yes I do  I would contact grindr and give them the info you have and tell them what’s happening, maybe they can shut down the account I know that this may sound horrible, but do you know who could be doing this? If so report them to the police.
