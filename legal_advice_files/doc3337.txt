 Just curious how the tolling statute works for minors. If an event happened when they were 14 years of age how long would they have to seek recourse? 7 years from date of injury or once they turn 20? if the other party hid facts that would have alerted you to the malpractice. Interesting. I wonder if that's how pa works.  [deleted] Pennslyvania generally imposes a 2 year statute of limitations on personal injury claims (42 Pa. C.S.A s 5524), but time does not run while the person who has the claim is a minor (i.e.) under 18. So the most likely answer is that they have until they turn 20. However, there may be other grounds on which the statute of limitation might be extended - such as concealment - and the individual should consult a PA attorney familiar with medical malpractice cases. Ok so it's not like a 17 year old would have until 24 years of age to bring suit? It would start when they turn 18 and expire on their 20th birthday  Statute of limitations to file a claim is two years and begins tolling when the minor reaches age 18. Malpractice of any kind is very fact specific and it is unfortunately beyond the scope of this subreddit. If this is a medical question, it is highly recommended to speak with a medical malpractice attorney; your state's bar may be able to refer you to one. They typically work on contingency, meaning there is little up front cost to you. Similarly, consultations are typically free. It wouldn't hurt to meet with one, have them look over your info, and go from there. If this is a question about legal malpractice, you should seek the advice of a second unrelated attorney and/or report the matter to your state bar association" I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
