 I was recently working for a political campaign and doing a great job. One night after work, a co-worker and I went out for drinks. By the end of the night, she came to my house, but we had an argument that left us both sour. Two days later, I'm told by my manager that some of the big wigs are coming in, so that I don't have up come in. That sounded weird, but I obviously stayed home. Later, I was contacted by the campaign and told that staffing needs had changed and that if I had any questions, I needed to contact the party's attorney. I did so, and when I told him that I thought it was over my outside of work interaction and that I would like to know what she'd said, he assured me he knew nothing about it and was simply told it was a common staffing need that sometimes arises in campaigns. Of course, I didn't buy this. He said he would ask about my concerns and let me know. He never did. Then, last night, my former coworker emails me and tells me that she was the reason I got fired. She said she felt attacked, and that she went right to the boss and told her. She said the boss immediately reported the incident. In case anyone is wondering, she wasn't attacked. I know Georgia is an at-will state, but was there any wrongdoing here? I was never asked about the incident and then they lied about why I was being terminated. I'm not sure whether to just move on or what.   -will state That's pretty much the end of it, as it means you can be fired for any or even no reason at all (as long as that reason isn't part of a protected class). Having an argument with a coworker outside of work is not a protected class, and frankly, is a valid reason to fire you.  No wrongdoing here. This is why many people will say to keep your work and social lives seperate or "don't poop where you eat". File for unemployment and look for a new job.
