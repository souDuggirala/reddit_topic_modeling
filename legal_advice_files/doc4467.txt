 Hi, I'm in Ontario, Canada. TL;DR - Honda forgot to put a crucial component in my car before I bought it, causing 1500$CAD or more in damage to the engine. Is there any way I'm able to pursue the Honda dealership that left the piece out to cover repairs? Would it be worth it for this amount? I bought a 2006 Honda Pilot August 2017. It had the timing belt replaced May 2017 by a Honda dealership on behalf of the used car lot I got it from. During this repiar, they didn't put the tensioner in. I only found out this week because of a knocking noise in my engine. I took it to another Honda dealership(I live in a different city than where I bought the car), where they identified the problem. There may be further damage to valves but they didn't want to go take anything else apart unless I was certain I wanted it repaired. This car has been a lemon, and I really just want to get what money I can from it and sell or junk it. I could maybe sell it for 1K if I get it repaired, but I can't afford fixing it myself. For the record, I'm switching to public transit.
