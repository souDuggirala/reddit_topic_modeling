 Currently in Austin Texas, and neighbors above me have a Toddler that they run around all day, stomping, shaking light fixtures, etc. Our lease has a specific part that says "Prohibited Conducts: behaving in a loud or obnoxious manner". There is no "quiet hours", this part is about it. I've complained with written notices, and the neighbors have been warned on multiple occasions now. Now, I don't want them to get evicted, because thats a shitty thing to do, but I also see this being an issue for any resident after me, so I feel like the apartment should want to address this long term. Anyways, the apartment is offering to let me move to a different unit, but I don't feel like I should need to spend my time, energy, and possibly money, to move to a separate unit. So couple of questions. 1) Is them not doing a better job of enforcing this grounds to break my lease? 2) If yes, is my unwillingness to move to a different unit (not same floor plan) going to prevent my ability to break my lease? I have written emails of my complaints as well as audio recordings of the loud neighbors.  Wouldn't moving into a different unit be less time, money and effort than breaking your lease and moving out entirely? No, you can break the lease per local laws and your lease. But you don't get to do it penalty free. Call the cops if they are violating noise ordinances.
