 So long story short, I am looking to sue the company I previously worked at for not paying me my yearly bonus despite having worked there the entire year. They claim that there was a clause saying I needed to be a part of the company at the time bonuses were paid out in order to qualify, but that clause was never in any of the contracts I signed, nor was it ever communicated to me while I was employed there. So! I'm going to sue them in small claims court but to start with I don't know where to send the demand letter via registered mail. Should it be the main office that I worked at? To the legal department? To the address of the corporation registered with the government of Canada? Side question - if anyone knows. If it comes to it, where and to whom would I serve the small claims court documents? It seems like it would be difficult to get to a director of the company to actually give the documents, since the company is so large. Hypothetically speaking - if this was the company I was to sue (it's not this one but I did find it on these websites - Mods, let me know if this is ok or if I should remove the links), and these were the addresses I found, which should I use to send the demand letter?

In this case, its the address shown on the [ic.gc.ca]() page.
