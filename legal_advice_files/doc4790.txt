 My husband is a gambling and drug addict. We are “trying to work it out”. Today I found out that his parents wrote a check for $325 in my name and gave it to him, to give to me. He instead deposited it into his bank account so that he could use it for a poker game tonight. Apparently he added my name to his bank account as authorized user. I’m not sure when he did this. But because he did that, he was able to deposit this check into his checking account. Is this illegal? How could he add me as a user on his bank account without my signature? I’m a little sick thinking about how often he may have done this.  Thank you! Yes, you can file a police report about absolutely anything, as long as you don't lie to the police. The police decide what action if any they will take. And...how was he able to add me as a user without my signature?? So confused why a bank would be ok with that. Will be calling them Monday.  Thanks. We aren’t currently divorcing. I do have an attorney because we have been trying to work on things but I want my bases covered. Do you know if I contact the police about this, will a report be filed regardless of whether or not charges could be filed? So there is a paper trail?  This is theft, but unless you are actively involved in separation proceedings, the police will probably tell you that it's a civil matter. Oh my bad, forgot this isn’t the moral support sub. How is this legal advice?
