 I drove to France with my partner for the day Was stopped by French customs car smelt of bud not long smoked one (had it coming I know) They clear the car strip searched me and put the car through an x-ray and had 5/6 people and a dog looking through it I’m a huge smoker I had medi tubs Cali tins baggies grinders edible packets and all sorts in the car I’ll just say if I was caught in the UK I’d probably be in jail My question is is there anything the UK police can follow up on? Will I have a criminal record ? My report sheet only seemed to mention 12g of cannabis. Can I still drive to France to go through the country ? Eg driving to Belgium? How will this affect me ? Or have I gotten a £60 fine and that’s it ? They did tell me if they find anymore I would be looking at jail, if that helps As far as I’m aware there was not a charge only a fine for possession. I was not arrested but I think I was detained? I didn’t ask if I was either but I did ask when I could leave when I knew it was coming to the end and they told me a time they had me for about 7 hours  We have no way of knowing any of this. It depends on what you get charged with.
