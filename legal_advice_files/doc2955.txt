 I saw my dad's past tax returns and I'm worried he may have not been reporting some of his income from his taxes (though I do not know for sure as I'm not an accountant and may be misreading). My parents have already gifted me a house. What's sad is that this house was paid for from my mom's earnings so it's definitely from clean money. But my parents file joint tax returns and my father owned the property as well when it was gifted to me. If my father was cheating on taxes could the irs collect on the property my parents gifted me? Also, if my parents divorce, can the irs go after the money my mom gets from the divorce? Thanks.  thanks.  .

But my parents file joint tax returns and my father owned the property as well when it was gifted to me. Sort of doesn't matter since they filed jointly. It isn't like you mother is claiming innocent spouse here. It can get real tricky, real fast. Possibly, but not likely. Typically the IRS would go after his assets first. If there was "fraudulent conveyance" (he transferred assets to avoid repaying), then yes, they will come after the house. This is not likely. ? It's my dad's business and my mom had no part of it. Possibly. If there were a settlement, the IRS could argue that the funds came from this untaxed income. In the case of fraud, there is no statute of limitations. So theoretically, they can go back forever. Realistically they do not. Chances are if 3 years has passed, he is probably outside the regular audit cycle and short of someone blowing the whistle here he likely is safe. You will want to talk to a tax attorney or CPA. The IRS has a lot of power, and the tax code is complicated
