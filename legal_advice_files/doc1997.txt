 Hi! So those in British Columbia will recognize what company I am referring to. On Christmas eve my car was hit while I was loading the ferry. There is pretty significant damage in one focal spot on my vehicle - between my front passenger door and my rear passenger door. Both doors are dented. On the deck, I spoke to a deckhand stated the gate likely popped open and hit my vehicle. He even said sorry (so many tkmes) he even said he was concerned he would get in trouble because he might have forgotten to properly latch the gate. He spoke to his boss who also said sorry to me and stated he was very sorry for what had happened. I made a big detailed report. A woman emailed me from the corporation and stated she would begin the investigation by talking to deckhands and looking at CCTV cameras. The NEXT DAY she sent me a detailed report stating I was liable and had "lost situational awareness of my vehicle" I called and asked for the CCTV evidence, she stated she would only provide it to insurance companies. My vehicle insurance company (also a public corporation) is in the process of obtaining the video, I also asked for pictures of the gate that I apparently hit in its locked position. My father is an engineer and he looked at the damage and stated it would be significantly unlikely that I had hit something.. I would be having to go sideways to create the damage!! My question is.. what do I do? It doesnt appear my insurance company is interested in fighting, they are simply staying they are treating it like I hit a stationary object. Do I take them to small claims court?
