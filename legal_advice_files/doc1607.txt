 Indiana. An employee died. We are processing payroll. Usually the paycheck is direct deposited. Do we need to do something differently since the employee passed away? [removed] NAL. Also not in Indiana. The policy most likely varies from company to company. I would consult your HR department or your most superior person you can talk to for advice. The company I work for, for example, processes payroll normally and HR deals with everything on their end. Usually next of kin gets access to bank accounts/money after a death, therefore that money should be in their account. My condolences to the family of the deceased.
