 I do apologize if this is the wrong subreddit to put this into! I go to a commercial gym, by skateboard since it’s about a mile away from home. Was approached by a rep at gym that my board (up against wall and out of anyone’s way/equipment) needs to be put in the locker room. I expressed that I understood but it didn’t fit in the lockers they provided and explained I’d keep my board out of the way. Manager comes over and explains it’s company policy and that I would have to put my board in the locker room anyway. I gave the manager the dame response in that my board doesn’t fit in the locker. I tried explaining that my board isn’t cheap, it’s almost 2k and the gym isn’t in the best of neighborhoods. But I still got hit with a no-go. Is there anything I can do in this situation or should I just not ride my board to the gym anymore? — that’s not the most ideal situation but if it comes down to it, whatever. If the gym requires that your skateboard be put in the locker room, then you'll need to put your skateboard in the locker room. If it doesn't fit in a locker, then you can either leave it unattended (and assume the risks and liability that come along with that), or find a different way to get to the gym. If you're asking if you have some inherent right to refuse to put your skateboard in the locker room and continue to be allowed to come onto the private property of and use the gym, then no.
