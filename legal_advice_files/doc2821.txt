 Hello, looking for some advice/guidance on how to get a dropped charge expunged. Was arrested for a high class misdemeanor about 10 years ago but the charges were dropped and I was told that the record is eligible to be expunged. How would I go about doing this Iâ€™m VA and how much would I need to expect to spend? Also, would I need to declare this in the future (e.g. on background clearance checks). Thanks in advance!
