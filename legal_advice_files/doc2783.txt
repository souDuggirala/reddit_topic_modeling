 Not gonna get into much detail, because I myself do not know much. But a classmate texted me today begging for $160, saying he needs it or else something bad will happen to him. I tried to press for answers but he did not budge. I couldn't wire him that much, so I said I could lend him $60, he begged for $65, so I "agreed". I sent it to him, because I am worried for his safety. But what will happen to me? Also I had to drag someone else, a friend at school because I did not have that much money in any account he could receive it with. So us two may be in trouble. But what could happen? He insisted it was not for anything illegal, but what if it was? I live in the United States.  Unless you knowingly provided funds for illegal activities you're unlikely to be in any legal trouble. You're also unlikely to ever get that money back either though...
