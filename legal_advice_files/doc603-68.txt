I have 3 points on DL In Florida. Work in the HVAC business and my boss is giving me a work van. But I’m worried the 3 points will raise the insurance rates to the point he won’t want to give me it. Lawyer I talked to says it will cost 200$ for a chance to get them removed. Points usually don't matter to commercial policies. He already pay rates high enough to cover any idiot he allows to drive.
