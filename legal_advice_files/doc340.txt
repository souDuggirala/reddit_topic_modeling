 Not sure if this is the correct subreddit. But, last summer I was on a trip to visit some family. On the way back, driving through NY I was pulled over for speeding and possession of marijuana. I never paid either ticket. Fast forward to this fall, I’m visiting family again and pulled over for speeding in NY again. Cop tells me about my previous and that my license is suspended in NY and lets me go because I’m with my family. Gives me a court date to go to, since I don’t live in NY I didn’t go to the court date. It hasn’t affected me in the current state I live in. But I’m curious if I’d be able to take care of everything without facing jail time.  Contact a criminal defense attorney who practices in the county where you were pulled over the second time, and ask them to check if there is an arrest warrant active in your name. The warrant will be filed in whatever court you were supposed to show up to. If they find a warrant (and they probably will), you can ask them about the steps for clearing it, and they will explain the process and quote you a price for resolving it. You may be required to travel to New York to get booked and released, but some attorneys manage to get their clients out of appearing in person if their clients live very far from the court venue or for other logistical circumstances. You may also have to post bail. In the future, just pay your fines. Tickets aren’t criminal offenses. Driving on a suspended license usually is. You could have avoided a criminal record if you had just paid the fines. These systems are designed to punish people who blow off dealing with their penalties, and at this point the situation has escalated in severity twice due to failure to follow up on court orders. The attorneys fees alone will likely be several thousand dollars. You need a layer. More than likely there is a warrant out for you due to missing the court date.
