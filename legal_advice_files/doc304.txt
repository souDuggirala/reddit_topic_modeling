 Throwaway because of situation. I just found out that a co-worker has been talking to other employees behind my back about my sexual orientation and making completely out of line remarks about my relationship with my parents in regards to being gay. I have never told this employee about my orientation however the owner does know about it, so I am assuming he was the one to tell this co-worker. This co-worker happens to be the owners best friend and has “protected him” in other situations before(not related to this though) What are my options in Michigan? It’s a small business, no formal HR department and no union anything. I’m concerned that bringing this up will result in my termination, not his and Michigan is an employ at will state.  You can file a complaint with the Michigan Department of Civil Rights. There is a risk that you end up being fired, but the law prohibits retaliating against people for bringing a discrimination complaint.
