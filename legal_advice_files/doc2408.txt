 My 18 year old son was arrested for public intoxication I am wondering what type of punishment he’s looking at in ONT? Bad news: at 18, he no longer falls under the Youth Criminal Justice Act. He's facing the ordinary, adult consequences of his decisions. If he's lucky, if he gets an attorney, and if this is his first offence, he can probably negotiate probation in lieu of charges and have this disappear on the wind if he completes his probation without issue. His probation is likely to involve some community service and that he refrain from drugs and alcohol. If he's unlucky, tries to represent himself, or has priors, then he's looking at the standard penalties for a summary offence: up to $5,000 in fines, and/or up to 6 months in jail. (It's rare for someone to get the maximums; take this with salt.) Usually public intoxication is a provincial offence and not a criminal offence Also the fact he’s underage “drinking under age” is again a provincial offence He’s either looking at fines or community service. Was he charged criminally or given a ticket? If he was charged criminally he should get a lawyer and try to negotiate a diversion program of some sort so he doesn't end up with a record. If it was a ticket it might just be $200 or so.
