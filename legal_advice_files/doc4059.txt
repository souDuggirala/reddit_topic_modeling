 So this guy thats my moms ex boyfriend said that he would help me pay for my car insurance for three months ( I paid him back fully for doing this) and then he would transfer it back into my name after three months. ( I am still currently financing the car from the dealership, we paid every single cent into this car.) Now he isn't putting the car back in my name. He is saying i owe him money even though i don't. I have so much proof that i came into the dealership every month to pay for it. Someone, please help me, I'm poor and this Mazda is the only thing that I feel accomplished buying. I'm 19 btw. This shit is so frustrating its messing with my head ðŸ˜­ Alright thanks for the advice. I will seek for a lawyer. Please don't ever make this mistake again. If someone offers to pay for your insurance, they can do so by writing you a cheque or e-transfer. They don't need to be on the ownership. As long as you're still paying for the car, and provided the down payment, and he did not pay for any part of the car whatsoever, (other than the insurance) I believe you may be able to seek an equitable remedy. Seek a lawyer, try to find a free consultation. Edit took out parts which were irrelevant. Well it's like a place where they sell a bunch of used cars and I put down $2500 cash and then every month since march 2018 I've been putting $240 down till now and i have three months left until im done paying for the car. You signed over your car to him? Also, why do you pay at a dealership? Iâ€™ve never heard of either of those situations and I lived in BC for 35 years.  You gave him your car? Why would you have transferred the ownership to him? It will probably be difficult and costly to force him to give you the car that is now his. You may have to try to prove he obtained it from you fraudulently.
