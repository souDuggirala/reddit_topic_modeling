 In renewing my lease my landlord now has a mold addendum I must sign releasing them from any and all harm and legal fees. Is this legal? Could it be argued this was signed under duress if any issues came up? The landlord was sued for mold neglect in the past and I know they are covering their end but didn't know how legal this was. I've been at the same place for years and my original lease didn't have this mold addendum. No, that clause is likely illegal. Mold can cause an uninhabitable home, which in turn, would be a landlord issue. You can't claim signing under duress, but it's very likely, though not guaranteed, a Judge would throw that clause out. I’ve had to sign addendums to leases pertaining to lead paint (I know there’s a law regarding that) but I’ve never heard of one for mold...
