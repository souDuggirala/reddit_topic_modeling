 Yesterday I got a parking ticket by the city of Phoenix for parking my car on the side of the street. The ticket says “parking where prohibited by sign or red curb”. About 20 feet behind my car there is a red curb and a no parking sign, but it seems like that is where the no parking ends (there is a sign 100 feet or so behind that where the red curb begins and one again where it ends). Many cars park where that sign and red curb end, and none of them had tickets. Cars have been parking there all year and never heard of anyone getting a ticket. So I’m confused why I have one. Was I just too close to the end of the red curb? Or does that no parking sign apply ahead of where the red curb ends? I’m in college and really cannot afford a ticket right now so any advice would be greatly appreciated.  1) Without seeing the area there's no way of knowing exactly what the sign means. If you think you're in the right you need to take pictures of the area with you to your court date. 2) Just because you haven't heard of other tickets doesn't mean they don't happen. 3) Just because someone else gets away with something doesn't mean you can. Lots of people speed on the interstate, but only a few get pulled over.  That would make sense. Do you think I have any chance of getting out of the ticket? The violation won't be in the system instantly. It may take several days to appear. Generally the officer will have to submit it back at the station then someone has to process it. That almost certainly will not happen until Monday, or Tuesday if tomorrow is a holiday.
