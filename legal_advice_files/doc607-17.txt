in Arkansas, boss is requesting I provide proof of every therapy appointment I go to because I'm "going over the allotted time" even tho I go on my lunch and usually make up the time the same day. is this legal or violating HIPPA?  They are not asking you for information on what was discussed or anything like that right? They just want proof you are actually at the therapists and not nodding off if your car. Nothing illegal about this.
