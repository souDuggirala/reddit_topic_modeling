 I recieved a letter in the mail today from the Ohio Attorney General's office on behalf of the Ohio Department of Transportation stating that I have ten days to pay a debt of $1,400 or I will be taken to court by a special counsel (an attorney named Charles Mifsud). The law office is closed so I was unable to reach Mr. Mifsud today, but I've been wracking my brain for the last half hour as to what in the hell I could possibly owe the Ohio D.O.T. $1,400 for. I'm a truck driver so I'm very familiar with the Ohio D.O.T., but I've never been cited or even received so much as an inspection in the state of Ohio. Has anyone recieved or does anyone know about debt collections like this? Should I get an attorney? I'm so confused by this entire thing, any advice on how to proceed is welcome. Thank you for your time.  Possible scam. Tried to look up your account on the OAG site? =%2FPayment Chuck Mifsud is in fact a collections attorney specializing in Ohio government agency debts. He's a flat-out expert; if the demand letter is unclear on the details, then that's on purpose. First, don't panic. This is an ordinary collections attempt, and because Mifsud's firm does so many of them they aren't quick to actually litigate. Treat it like any other collections attempt, by requiring the collections firm to prove the debt. There are multiple websites that explain how to exercise your rights under the [Fair Debt Collections Practices Act.]() In my opinion you don't need an attorney until or unless you are actually sued. This is just a demand letter to collect a debt. Start by disputing the debt, and that process will reveal why the DOT thinks you owe them money.
