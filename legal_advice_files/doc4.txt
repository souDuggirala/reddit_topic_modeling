 Hi guys, so this is definitely my fault, I’m just wondering how to best handle it. My parents filed for bankruptcy when I was 20, my father spends uncontrollably and likes to burn bridges. He was sued and they tried to go after his piece of our family farm, so in order to avoid losing it, they filed for bankruptcy(definitely for the best with the rest of their financial situation) my mom, about 2 years before this had decided to go back to work to try to keep up with the bills. My dad had wanted to support her asked her to stay home when my brother I were born but she realized they would lose the house if she didn’t start contributing saving. Here’s where I fucked up. 6 months after the bankruptcy. My mom asked if she could be an authorized user on a card of mine so she could have more freedom I had no worry about her paying it off. She spends basically nothing on herself, hoarding her paychecks in cash (if they are in the bank my dad will spend them) so she can help them stay afloat. So I said yes. For some reason I will absolutely never understand, she gave my dad access to it as well he racked up $10k on the card. They used it for way longer than I was comfortable with have only made a $2000 dent in it. I’ve been asking for a YEAR since I got engaged to have it paid off by my wedding in November and this is all the progress they have made. I just want this off my credit report, which thankfully is still in excellent standing because of how diligent I am with my bills, but it’s racking me with anxiety every single day. Is there ANYTHING I can do about this? I really don’t want to sue my parents.... but is there a way I can move it to something in their names? Thanks. Thanks for the feedback. I’m pretty sure they haven’t yet bounced back enough to do that. No, you cannot move it to their name alone unless they can take out a loan to pay it off. Your only option is to pay it off.
