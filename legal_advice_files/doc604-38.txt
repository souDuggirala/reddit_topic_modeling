I'm working as a dishwasher in a company that is absolutely insane busy when they open new locations. 
The dishwasher pushes out the racks of dishes. They also have a pan chute from the line to the dish pit and it happens to be under the table where the racks come out of the dishwasher.
I'm changing the kart in the chute and grabbing the pans off the floor and a rack of collins cups catches and flys right off the table and onto my back.
Thats the inncident details.
I made a claim. Went to the ER to get checked on because my back was numb or tingling but it didn't feel right. Doc said that i got my nerves smooshed and i should be alright in a few days and considering i i already needed physical therapy i'm doing relatively well. But they cut my hours down to one day a week down from 50 hours. Should i have reason believe they did this because i got hurt and if so what kind of lawyer specializes in these kinds of things. 
 Since before i was working there. Since i started. About 3 monthes ago. How long have you been working 50 hour weeks?
