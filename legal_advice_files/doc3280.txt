 My car got hit by another car and had a huge dent in it and bumper damage, I talked to my safety and security at the hotel and they say they don’t cover any damages in the parking lot because they don’t have cameras and can’t file a claim for it stating it’s park at your own risk. What’re my options? Well it’s been a day (12:35am on Sunday) and I thought that work would cover it when I got home I noticed it, so I figured I’d report it when I came into work, so I doubt they cover it. Work didn’t cover it because they don’t have a policy that covers it. That's your decision. But your insurance policy probably states somewhere that you're supposed to report potential claims as soon as possible. Okay, I was wondering if it would be cheaper just to fix it, instead of reporting to my insurance and letting the premium go up  Get the police report and report it to your insurance ASAP. Okay, they told me that I should file a police report and then report it to my insurance too. Or should I get a quote on it first? Make a claim through your own insurance, if you have full coverage. If you don't have full coverage, reconsider that decision so this doesn't happen to you again.
