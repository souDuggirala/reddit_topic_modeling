 Before I start, yes I know this was wrong and I was being stupid. Okay so at this medium sized grocery store chain I go to (Oregon), occasionally when I’m shopping I’ll snag a few pieces of candy out of bulk or maybe a candy bar. I don’t know why and honestly it seems idiotic looking back. Anyways the LP officer stopped me because he’d seen enough. While police were not called, he said I will be sent a civil dispute and have received a 2 year ban from the store. However, he did say if I paid the dispute I could call the regional manager with hopes to get the ban lifted. What are the odds I can actually get this ban lifted from the store? Thanks! 50/50. Stop stealing   Lucky you - if police was involved, you'd be in much bigger trouble. Essentially zero - nobody wants a customer that is casually shoplifting every time they come by. Find another grocery store to shop at (since if you try going to this one again you will be trespassing and they will call police for that), and please refrain from further shoplifting. Whatever small joy you get from that is not worth the long term headaches that come with it, as you are starting to discover.  Because you wanted to and didn't think you'd get caught or that it didn't matter because it was such a small amount. That said, and assuming you actually pay, then maybe you could get the ban lifted. But that is up to them. That's up to manager. Stop stealing shit.
