 Mo. Unfortunately my mother died recently. According to the will I am executor of the estate. The estate must be sent is sent to probate to have the court name me personal representative. I live in another state. Documents sent to me to be signed and notarized had the wrong state on one page. It listed me in the county of (blank) and incorrectly listed Missouri rather than the state I reside in and had them notarized in. The Notary said he wasn't able to notarize something for Missouri because we're not in that state. He crossed out the typewritten state and wrote in the correct state, then notarized it. I know some documents can be really picky when it comes to crossing out words and hand writing them in. Will the probate court reject these documents because of the original error was made and wrong state listed? Got documents to notarize, secretary listed wrong state, notary crossed out incorrect state, wrote in correct state and notarized documents.  As a Notary, you can only Notarize in the state you’re licensed in. It does not matter after that where the document goes. If the document is not accepted, it’s not due to the state it was notarized in.   The clerk shouldn't reject them because there's no law that requires a form to be typed. And you said the notary corrected the errors. But IME, court clerks sometimes think their gatekeeping duties go far beyond what the rules actually say, so YMMV. I'm sorry for your loss. I guess it is also possible the court could choose to reject the document. That would perhaps be more likely if there were some substantive dispute in play.
