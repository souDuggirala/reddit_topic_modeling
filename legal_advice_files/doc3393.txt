 I'm curious how attorneys organize their case binder. Are there specific spections and headers I should have that would be a best practice to keep the documents I am getting and filling in order? Right now I have: 1. Hand written notes (dates and times of when I sent or got stuff) 2. Copies of documents sent with the cert mail attachment. 3. Copies of documents stamped by court 4. Letters from the defense of filed docs 5. Miscellaneous docs I might need in the future. Various people do it in different ways. There is no right or wrong way to do it so long as you have everything you need in a spot where you can find it. I typically do 1) Relevant pleadings/other filings 2) Proposed exhibits (4x copies, one for me, one for judge, one for witness, and one for opposing counsel) 3) Notes/Copies of relevant Cases (3x of the cases with highlights of relevant sections, one for me, one for judge, one for opposing counsel) But again, so long as you know where it all is, anything that works for you is fine.
