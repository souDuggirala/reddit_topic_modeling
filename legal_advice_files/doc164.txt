 The use for a shellelagh was primarily a walking stick but could be used as a cudgle if weighted. My issue is that if I don't lead the shellelagh it's not being explicitly made to be used as a weapon. What are the legality surrounding this? shillelagh Along with a shellelagh being hardened by covering it in lard and baking it. The main thing is that shellelas are primarily walking sticks. They aren't weapon neccisarily until you add the lead You could save yourself some hassle and simply call them walking sticks.
