 Trying to find a place to start... Canada British Columbia Employer of construction cleaning company didnt pay over 10 employees and a manager The manager is owed 7000$ The workers well over 16,000$ He has disappeared but we have conclusive evidence he lives a town over in his house. He has received a letter in the mail declaring that he has 14 days till we take this to court. How do we serve him? What laws did he break? Will they get paid , as the company is now bankrupt?  Have you made an [employment standards complaint]()yet? If the money is owed from the six months, the government can help you get paid. If its longer than that, you have to go to small claims.

When companies go bankrupt, there is a federal government program to help the employees get some money, although its not exactly quick: []() I'm in the US, so I don't know if you have a department of labor or a wage and hour board like we do here. If you haven't retained a lawyer for this, you need to get that started. Most attorneys will have access to a few process servers who will find and serve the defendant. That is something you should not do.
