 I rode my bicycle into wet cement yesterday. There were two open (wide enough for me to ride through) barricades. My front tire sunk in immediately and I flew, face first over the handle bars. Nothing broken, no tears, but feeling pretty sore and definitely going to need PT. Advice? If anything they should sue you for driving threw barricades and damaging their work How so? You saw barricades and chose to ignore them. Many places it is illegal to even ride your bike on the sidewalk Fair enough. Someone else did it just an hour before me as well. Poorly marked perhaps? Don't ride through barricades and he prepared to pay for the damage you did to the wet cement.
