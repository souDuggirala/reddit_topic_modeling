 i currently live in breck, co, but i had one thing on my record in ft worth, tx that occurred: -5 years ago -was my first offense -completed my deferred prosecution for the allotted time given just a few weeks ago i took the paperwork my lawyer gave me to file for it at the courthouse (because i moved to colorado for a job the week of new year’s day) and they took the papers, my money, and filed it with no issue. my sister tells me i got a certified letter in the mail today and i told her to read it to me, she said my expunction was “denied”. due to: “petition fails to properly verify identifying information and arrest details.” and “verification must be accurate and cannot be based on another persons belief” what? what did i do wrong? my lawyer himself drew up those docs and all i did was file and pay for them. it’s my first offense and i’ve never even been pulled over or ticketed before. what is my next step here? (so i have the full-time job that i moved here for, but i wanted to work with cannabis part time as well- and i’m worried i won’t be able to get my MED badge now that i’ve learned my expunction was rejected) TL;DR: my record expunction was denied because: “petition fails to properly verify identifying information and arrest details.” and “verification must be accurate and cannot be based on another persons belief” could i still get my MED support badge in CO?  i’ve been trying to get in touch with him the moment i found out this morning. i’m thinking maybe it’s cause it’s the weekend? the big issue is my MED badge appt is on tuesday because monday is a holiday and i’m worried he won’t be back in touch in time. so i wanted to see what reddit had to say  The very best person to answer this question is your lawyer. Anyone else would have to both review every document and your case file.
