 My boyfriend’s little brother, we’ll call him John, is being bullied rather badly in school and the school is doing nothing about it. The latest incident was when a student cast John’s YouTube channel onto the smart board and made sub of his videos while a substitute teacher was in the room. He has been suspended because of reports given by students that the school didn’t report. They have done nothing to protect John or punish his bullies. I know Ohio has bullying laws and I’ve looked into them, this school is definitely breaking them. They’ve already talked to the school several times and nothing has changed. It also may be worth mentioning that John has social problems, I’m not sure if you’d call it a disability but it’s bad enough that they’ve considered sending him to a private school that caters to children with disabilities. He also has an IEP. Should this family get a lawyer and do they have the backing of the law to sue? Thanks for any help. I know the family it’s at a complete loss. Sorry, I meant investigate. The school didn’t investigate the reports they just took the students at their word. Here’s a link to the laws and codes about bullying in Ohio [3313.666 District policy prohibiting harassment, intimidation, or bullying required.](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3313.666)  I don't understand what you mean by "John has been suspended because of reports given by students that the school didn’t report." I'm not sure what anti bullying laws you are referring to. Can you provide more information about that?  John Who was suspended?
