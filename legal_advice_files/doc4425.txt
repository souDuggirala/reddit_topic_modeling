 I am in the process of selling my house. My agent says this is a common scam. I flagged the post on Craigslist, but my agent seems to think no further action is necessary. Someone reached out to me to let me know about this. She was in contact with the scammer, and he tried to get her to send money to Walmart. She sent me a name, phone number, and email address. Should I forward this information to the police? It would be nice to have justice served, but from what I've read online I think your'e right. Nothing is likely to happen. This is the same police department that wouldn't help when my friend's xbox was stolen from his car. Xbox support said they saw it online (he had the serial from the receipt still), and if the police would call they could give the police info. The police refused. In addition to the sign that was mentioned, search for the listing with other sites like zillow, zumper, trulia and hotpads (I'm sure there are others), contact them and have the rental listing removed. I'd file a police report just in case the scammer is an idiot and doesn't cover their tracks very well. It's a long shot and probably nothing will happen, but it's nice to imagine this dolt getting a look at the justice system from within. It also helps to establish patterns and may lead to reforms and/or action in the future. Aside from the above, do not contact this scammer no matter how tempting it is. Let law enforcement handle it if they are so inclined. There is a for sale sign in the front yard still, so if anyone shows up they'll see that. I'm going to keep an eye on Craigslist for reposts as well. We close on the 19th, so it shouldn't come back after the listing is removed. I'm guessing this sort of thing is automated, the ad description was copied from the listing. You might want to put a sign in the window that says “HOUSE NOT FOR RENT—ITS A CRAIGSLIST SCAM”
