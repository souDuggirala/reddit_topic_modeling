 I live in a neighbourhood with a lot of old houses (late 1800's) and my municipality offers free pipe checks and lead testing. A lot of my neighbours were getting the checks and I had brought up the idea with my landlord. She said not to worry as she thought the pipes had already been fixed before she bought the house years ago, but I figured it was free so I might as well check. The pipes weren't replaced and we have moderate levels of lead in our drinking water. The landlord was angry that we got the check anyways and isn't going to pay for the pipes to be replaced or for a water filter. She essentially said we could move out after 60 days notice but gave no other option. Anything else I could do? Are they not obligated to address a health risk like this? Just as a practical matter you can buy a filter to fix this and install it yourself for under $100. I'm not sure what you mean by "moderate" but if it's above 10 Âµg/L you should pursue it. Make a complaint to the landlord in writing that the water is not currently potable because of the lead content and you would like it fixed. There are faucet-mounted filters that will filter out lead so replacing all the pipes isn't her only option. If she responds again that she will not do anything about it, or if she doesn't respond in a reasonable time frame, you can file at the LTB for maintenance not done.
