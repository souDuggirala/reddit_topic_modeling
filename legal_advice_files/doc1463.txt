 Ok, quite the story. Little pretense I live in Wisconsin and I’m into buying hyped up sneakers. I joined a sneaker group chat on Facebook and I began talking to a man who lives in North Carolina and we worked out a deal. It was rather good and I decided to take it. I paid an associate of his through western union, and they have claimed the money. He claimed he shipped shoes to me after I paid him but he refused to send me a tracking number and he later blocked me. What do I do? I haven’t told my parents or anyone around me yet. I want to call a police station in North Carolina and report fraud but I don’t know what that will do. Those sorts of scams usually go unresolved, money is likely gone, happens a lot don't feel too bad  That money is gone. That "associate" is a money mule. You may report it to your police station. It will likely lead nowhere. This person could be anywhere in the world. Western union is the preferred payment for scammers. Next time buy in a 3rd party platform like eBay where there are protections.  How much out of curiosity?
