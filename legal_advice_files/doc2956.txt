 I'm renting a 2 bed apartment in an apartment complex and my lease renewal is coming up at the end of this month. I currently pay $1400 ish per month. I received a letter stating that if I allowed my lease to convert to month-to-month, my rent would rollover to $5000 ish per month (~340% increase). I believe the lease states I am required to notify them of move-out with 60 days notice, otherwise I would be charged $5000 a month OR sign a new lease at a lower rate. This is obviously to force people into signing a new lease and a shitty business practice imo. If you notified them with 30 days, you would be required to pay $5000 for that 30 day 'late' notice. Note that the actual rollover MTM amount of $5000 is not explicitly stated in the lease, but it says something along the lines of "to be determined by management office". Am I able to legally post my lease terms and the letter I received from property management to alert potential renters about this strongarm approach to lease renewal on a Google review or other review sites? If the lease doesn't have a confidentiality clause, you are free to disclose it. And it's also likely you are not obligated to pay that increased rent. Although they then can give you a notice to move out (as per the lease).  Unless you are under some sort of non-disclosure there is nothing preventing you from notifying others.
