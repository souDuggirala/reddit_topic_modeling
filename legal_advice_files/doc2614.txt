 This is a follow up to [\_exroommate\_poured\_bleach\_all\_over\_my\_suits/]() and [\_finding\_someones\_address\_for\_lawsuit\_los/]() I filled out this form: []() ...noting that I am a party representing himself, pro se. I went to a different post office, as advised, and they seemed willing to accept it, but they said the only post office who has the information is the specific location in the same zip code in question...So I went back to "my" post office, and I escalated with management, and even the manager's branch or regional manager was there, and they said they would not give me the information without an existing case / case number. It seems just this location is for some reason stingy about this. I explained that in order to have a case in small claims, I must first issue a letter of demand to the defendant, which I can't do without the address. Could / should I send the demand letter via certified mail to the old address, so USPS will forward it, and do the same thing with the eventual notice / summons of the small claims lawsuit? Should I begin this case with the court so I can bring them back a case number so they give me his address so I can serve him the documents? Should I just buy a cheap gps locator and have it forwarded to his new address thereby obtaining the address regardless of their cooperation? I am unsure how to proceed. Please advise, thx
