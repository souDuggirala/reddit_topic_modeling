 We're an early-stage startup in Seattle selling a hardware product. We have a fully working prototype and would like to start getting our product in the hands of customers. We want to start out by only selling in Seattle first. Obviously, we don't have the money to make the product first and then sell it so we're looking to collect preorders. We already have one person who is pretty much ready to commit. What's the appropriate way to go about taking these early customers' preorder money?
