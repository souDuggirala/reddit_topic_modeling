My girlfriend was working for a marketing company for a month, however due to her having to pay all transport and accommodation costs out of her own pocket to attend the marketing events, she quit as she wasn't making any money.

&amp;#x200B;

She received a phone call this morning from her ex-boss saying that as she no longer works for the company she will not be receiving the money that is owed to her. They owe her 4 weeks wages totalling  Â£590.

&amp;#x200B;

She was technically self-employed during this time, and had a contract with the company that they provide her with events to attend, and she keeps a record of any sales she makes, the money is paid to the company and then they pay her the commission that she has earned. it was also stipulated in her contract that they would pay her weekly bonuses based on her performance which she has not received.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately she does not have access to a copy of her contract as it was stored on the company's online space, her login for which has been revoked.

Is there any legal recourse we can take to get this money? It's not loads but we need it to get by. Ah didn't realise that was a sub, thanks very much /r/LegalAdviceUK should be able to point you in the right direction.
