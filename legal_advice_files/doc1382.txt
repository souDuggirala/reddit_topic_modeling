 I got snapped by a traffic cam going through a red light. I was driving slower than the speed limit, and hit my brakes before I normally would in good weather, but I hit a patch of really slick ice and slid. I ended up stopped in the intersection, and so I had to go through it (and I'd already been snapped). I looked around, but I could only find a similar case where the person was talking about hydroplaning and it sounded sketchy. I genuinely don't believe there was anything I could've done short of maybe jumping the sidewalk. Do I have any grounds for defense in this kind of situation? Thanks! Perfect answer Being guilty of driving too fast for conditions does not make you immune from being charged with failure to obey a traffic control device.  You could have been driving with consideration for road conditions which would involve driving slower and breaking sooner. If you want to fight the ticket you can hire a traffic attorney.  Not really, unfortunately. If conditions elsewhere were good (no ice or snow on the road), you may be able to argue that you were driving at an appropriate speed for the conditions, but it's a hard argument to make. You can fight it but you might also be buying yourself a ticket for driving unsafely for conditions. Red light cams are automatic, so you might be able to fight it, but without a way to prove how fast you were going it's doubtful you'd win A judge may cut you a break, but the typical response will be that you were going too fast for conditions.
