 SWIM is contesting a traffic stop. Is found guilty in court after contesting the traffic citation. Instead of the original fine, now SWIM is being given the original fine and 12 months of probation until they write an apology letter to the police officer for "being rude." How can a person be imposed a worse punishment than the original punishment? It feels retaliatory and wondering how something like that can even be imposed, is there just broad judge leeway when it comes to doling out punishments? Utah, USA if it's worth anything. For the uninitiated: SWIM in internet parlance means Someone Who Is Me. Somehow, someone got the idea that the third word was 'isn't' and that posting 'SWIM' instead of 'I' or 'me' would be the one weird trick that prevents the FBI/DEA from arresting them. That someone is probably in federal prison. I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
