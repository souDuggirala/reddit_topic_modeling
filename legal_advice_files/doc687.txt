 Obligatory long time lurker first time poster... and mobile user so sorry for the blocky text. I manage a restaurant in Florida. For the past year a customer has come in with their service dog and been nothing but cordial. We have always allowed dogs in the cafe and have never had a complaint as the area is very pet friendly. The first complaint was made by the customer I mentioned above. They have said that the other animals allowed in the cafe should only be service animals. The non service animals distract/interfere with their service animal and trigger their phobia (or one of them) which is... of dogs... which I though strange? So is their any legal ramifications to allowing non service animals in a place of business while there is someone there, with a service animal, who says they are uncomfortable and that it is interfering with their support animal? Thanks for the feedback! ..followed up with a sign that "we don't like people who don't like dogs." Dogs are awesome. should be a sign thats let people who don't like dogs know this is dog friendly cafe.  No, if you allow other dogs in that is fine. Besides that service dogs are selected for having the temperament of "my job/human comes first." I have dog sat for several dogs that have failed out of seeing eye dog training for being too friendly with other dogs. They got distracted and forgot that they had a job to do. Not the quality you want in a seeing eye dog or any type of service dog. If this dog is getting distracted by other dogs it makes me question if this dog is an emotional support dog rather than a service dog.
