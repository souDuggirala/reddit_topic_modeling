[Scotland] I am living in student accommodation however, I couldn't get accommodation thought the uni so had to go to private accommodation, this means I am in the centre of town, and there is a winter festival on, and they have set up a ride right out side the building and not only is it extremely noisy but the ride offence a full view into my room, I have contacted the local council about this but have got no responce and the land lords have gone to a meeting about the noise but all they said was they would try to keep the noise down.

I know this might seem petty, it's just the fact it's exam time and the noise is interfering we me studying/revising and I'm getting stressed out about this.

I know it's not possible for them to move it, I was just wondering if there was anyway to convince them to keep the noise down especially during the later hours and possibly somehow convince them to move the event for next year.
