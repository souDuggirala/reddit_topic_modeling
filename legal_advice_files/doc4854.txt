 Hi everyone. Just as the title says, I broke up with my partner and now I'm worried about pictures I sent him. I'm not sure if I'll ever see him again, but I blocked him on all social media and blocked his number so he can't contact me, but I'm not sure if he's vindictive enough to share explicit photos that I've sent him in the past. Is there anything I can do to make sure he doesn't share them, or if he shares them is there any legal action I can take to make him stop or stop the replication of them? Thank you! pray he doesnt share them and if he does then report him to the police, but only way to be certain it wont happen is to not send them in the 1st place, remember this for your next relationship Alright; I'm looking into those repercussions now, thanks. Thank you for this advice. I don't want to trigger him, but he's a cowardly type, so I think it might deter him. I'll consider this.  't even know there was one. He should know as well. You've blocked him, which is good, and you don't want to break that wall you've put up. But once they're out there it's hard to impossible to undo, so as crazy as this sounds if it were me I'd consider having an attorney draft a letter to him, on law firm letterhead, delivered not by you, explaining the law and the penalties. Unless you think this will trigger him and he'll throw caution to the wind. The letter will have no legal weight but it will let him know that this is illegal, and that you have attorneys (not that you'd need them if breaks a law, but he might not know that). You canâ€™t prevent him from doing it. However, there are legal repercussions if he does. I look into this law; I didn't even know there was one. Thanks for mentioning it! I'm just worried he may be vengeful enough over the break up and fights to post them online. Florida has a revenge porn law. Is there a particular reason you're worried he will do this?
