 I got an unexpected job offer that requires me to move to CA from DC in mid-January. My lease expires at the end of August. When I emailed my landlord about moving out, he pointed to the early termination section of the lease, which requires me to give 90 days’ notice and pay 1 month’s rent as a fee. Since I was only able to give 30 days’ notice (due to just receiving the offer), I am on the hook for 2 months’ rent after vacating. The lease also allows subletting, which I asked the landlord about in my email, but he didn’t acknowledge. I just want to see if there are other options or protections in the DC code that could possibly alleviate my obligation to pay for 2 months of rent after vacating at the end of January. Thank you! There are 4 reasons you can break a lease without penalty in DC, none of which you have described (military duty, domestic violence, code violations, landlord harassment). This means that the procedure outlined in your lease is your option. Your landlord has a duty to mitigate their damages, meaning they can't unreasonably refuse to re-rent the place to someone else in order to intentionally keep you paying for an apartment you no longer live in. This does not mean they need to go out of their way to find a replacement renter, it generally just means they must do no more to advertise the unit than they did when it was vacant. No, you are going to be held to the contract you signed. following up with your landlord about a possible sublet is your best option.
