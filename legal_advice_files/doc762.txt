 The landlord has come to our house multiple times to fix heat to no avail on documented dates from 1/22-1/29. He offered to move us to his other place but when we finally moved on 1/28, he had yet to reset door codes as promised and we were unable to move for another couple of hours. Today, 2/1, we had the entire house inspected by local code enforcement, in which they cited the house for inadequate heating conditions. To my knowledge, it is within our tenant rights to withhold rent payments until the heat is fixed in accordance with local and state law. []() What I'm unsure of is how much rent deduction we are entitled to for living without heat to legal standards. I figured 7 days times the daily rent payment value along with the costs of purchasing supplies for our landlord was sufficient. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!!
