 My mom rented a place a month ago that had a storage shed listed on every ad online when we were looking at it. My wife and I moved across the country to help her move in and the owner showed up a day after we started moving in saying that the storage shed wasn't part of the property. We made a laundry list of problems with the property (it's not a 'bad' property but it does have some 'hair' on it that needs to be repaired. But the storage shed is the big issue. As my wife and I are exceptionally busy and haven't had time to fill out the lease app and, to be honest, we're afraid we've annoyed the owner by picking at them about the storage shed we'd like some money off the rent for the coming month. Does anybody know what our rights are?  Mom has the right to the property she rented. And to the repair of any reasonable condition issues. If she can demonstrate a shed was offered as a part of that property she's likely entitled to the shed, to a reasonable credit against her rent (which frankly is likely to be fairly small), or perhaps to end the lease. If mom can work this out with the landlord she likely should. There may not be enough at stake to make paying the attorney worthwhile. If she has a right to the storage shed, it would be stated in the lease. A picture of a shed in an ad does not give her a legal right to access the shed. What does the lease itself say about the storage shed? What do you mean that you haven't filled out "the lease app"? What does the lease say about the storage shed?
