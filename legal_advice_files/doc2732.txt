 Hello, someone I once knew hit a parked car pretty badly. They told me they were going to leave a note but apparently, they never did. Is there anyway to anonymously report the crime? Would there even be a purpose to it? This was about 3 years ago but I only now found out they didn’t actually leave a note.  The car that was hit? I vaguely remember the color, that it was a midsized car, and I can describe the hit but not the actual make or model of the car.  Could you describe the car? I remember the exact place it happened and I THINK I can figure out the date too! Thanks for the info! Yeah, i’ll just probably not do anything. Just wanted to see if there’s anything I could do to make it right. Felt pretty bad for the person when I found out he didn’t leave a note.  Unless you know exactly when and where the car was hit there’s really no point in reporting it. If all you have is "Joe hit a car 3 years ago, and didn't leave a note," there's nothing anyone can do. Even if you had a police report number (assuming the victim even reported it in the first place) or an ID on the victim's vehicle, there's very little chance that it's going to be newly investigated at this point unless you live in a very small town with very bored police.
