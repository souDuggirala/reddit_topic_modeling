Last night I was in an altercation. Nothing physical and no citations were given and no arrest were made. However I was intoxicated and the police made a report, that I am currently in the process of requesting.

If the record is something along the lines of saying I was publicly intoxicated or disturbed the peace would that show up if a company runs a background check on me.

I'm in Michigan btw.

EDIT: also if I was not charged for anything at the time, is it possible to be charged with something like this at a later date? Say if cameras are viewed and it's determined I was being disorderly before the police came? If a report was merely taken, that is never going to show up on a standard background check.

You'd need to have been issued a citation, or charged with a crime, or processed at the police station in order to possibly show up on a background check.
