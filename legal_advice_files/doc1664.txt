 Here's the story: I live with 2 roommates (both on the lease), 1 of them (roommate A) wants to leave for a new job out-of-state Myself and the other roommate (roommate B) wish to stay in the unit Roommate A agreed to pay two months of our total rent to no longer be responsible for the unit Roommate A would no longer be able to reside in the unit, but their name would still be on the lease Can this be captured in a roommate's agreement? Can it be enforced? What other options do we have? You cannot restrict entry if they are still on the lease. Forbidden by who? If they are on the lease as a general rule they have right of entry. They would still be retained on the lease but forbidden from entry in the apartment. Your landlord is the only one who can release the roommate from the lease.
