 Hi reddit, I need some help in understanding the decision made in my employers unemployment appeal. The original decision gave me benefits but after appeal the determination was reversed unfortunately. In the notice I received it states the claimant is disqualified for benefits under code 1256 until he returns to bona fide employment and has sufficient wages to purge the disqualification. As far as I can tell (there’s nothing in the decision) that says I owe back my benefits for any $ amount. How does this work moving forward. I’m looking to appeal but want to understand this decision before doing so.  You'll just have to wait and see.  Okay, I have not received benefits since 12/9. The period I received was 11/8-12/9. I understand it says I was disqualified but does purging the disqualification mean they will garnish wages? What I’m trying to figure out is what is next, I am currently employed so I’m hoping to move on from this stuff Code 1256 means you were disqualified because you either quit or were fired for cause.  Okay but what does having sufficient wages to purge the disqualification mean? I was afraid if I lost the appeal packet would come with a sheet of paper telling me I needed to pay back a dollar amount (in this case 1,600) by a certain date or something.   : "An individual is disqualified for unemployment compensation benefits if the director finds that he or she left his or her most recent work voluntarily without good cause or that he or she has been discharged for misconduct connected with his or her most recent work.
