 I am a 14 year old male in Ohio, and was wondering if I am legally allowed to get a job. You first off need a working permit, cannot work during school hours, or more than 3 hours on a school day. Additionally cannot receive more than 18 hours in a school week. Yes you can get a job, but take a look at the legal restrictions [here.] () Your parents don't have to let you get one though.
