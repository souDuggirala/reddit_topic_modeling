 She has a really good lawyer, and has accused me of being a hypochondriac and worse. Unfortunately, she has evidence, since I did go through a period of worrying my children were sick and she took over my emails, voice memos, etc. The good news is that I'm perfectly mentally well, but how do I demonstrate this? My time is running out. That's awfully expensive to see a psychiatrist. In the US a psychiatrist is usually $100-200 per visit, even without insurance. You might need to see them a few times for them to have a professional opinion about your mental health, but I don't think it would be 50-100 times. Sorry, Iâ€™m not exactly sure how health care works in Canada. In the US, this would be covered by health insurance. Do you not have your own attorney for this? The family court will understand if you were concerned about your children's health, even if you had hypochondria, if this manifested itself as concern I do not think this is going to result in your children being regarded as at risk from you. Could you expand a bit on your belief that you need to prove to the court you are not insane. Have you had a diagnosis, or ever been detained under mental health legislation? The family courts would need good evidence that your 'insanity' could pose a risk to anyone. Looks like about $10,000 bucks in Canada. You have a psychiatric/ psychological evaluation done.
