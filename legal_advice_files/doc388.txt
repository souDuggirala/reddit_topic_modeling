 As you all may have seen u/Ghostric’s post on askreddit, “How much dirt? For worm? and the top response was from u/TemujinTheKhagan, saying 3 dirt. So, i gave my pet worm 3 dirt, and shortly after, the thing fucking died. What can i do against u/TemujinTheKhagan for spreading false information that can KILL your pet worm. Any Advice? Lmao
