 I do not have custody of my daughter. I misread our divorce papers. I'm paying support to the point I can't afford to live on my own. I cannot afford to go to court to try to change this. What options do I have if any? I lost my job at the time. I tried to go to enforcement and explain but they said that it won't change and that my pay is only looked b at every two years. Fuck you Karen! You have two issue: Fighting for more custody/visitation time requires you to go to court and ask for a change. You can do that any time Changing child support requires you to show a cause. What changed from the first order?  You have to go to court to challenge or change a custody or support order. Call your state BAR to see if there are legal aid options available to you.
