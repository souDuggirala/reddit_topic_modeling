 I received a letter recently saying my moms insurance company owes her $1100+. The letter seems to be from some kind of law firm, and claims to be the second notice (shes been deceased since 2008 btw). As her son can I get the money? Yes. If there was no spouse at the time of death, you should be able to claim the money. If they expect you to pay anything to get it, it is a scam. Thanks for the reply. She didn't have a will, and I'm her only child. Anything she had of value she gave, or signed over to me before she died. The whole thing is pretty foggy to me after all these years, but I think her reasoning back then had something to do with her debt, and trying to protect me. Does that even make sense?  The money would go into her estate. If she had a will, then the money gets handed out as per the will. If she had no will, the money gets handed out under intestacy law. If you are her only child and she was not married upon death, you would be entitled to the money. Before she died she had everything put in my name (house, car, etc). Is that the same thing? Who was the executor of her estate?
