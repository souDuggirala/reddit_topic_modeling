 The food place I worked in for the last 6 months has had some consistant safety issues, I have brought them up to the boss multiple times and have mostly been ignored. Recently they installed a new metal holder that I have cut myself on three times. So I've always been a squeaky wheel. I reported the store to OSHA, they called me to condirm what I reported and were incredibly nice. He also mentioned I was protected from retaliation. This week the new schedule went up, I typically work 36-40 hours a week. I was scheduled for 16, on what most people would consider, shitty shifts. Who do I contact to report retaliation. I'm certain she knows it was me due to my history reporting unsafe things.   "I reported the store to OSHA, they called me to condirm what I reported and were incredibly nice.
