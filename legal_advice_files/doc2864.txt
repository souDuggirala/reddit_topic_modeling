 Just got an email from a contracting company I used to work through over 2.5 months ago saying they overpaid me for 6 hours on my very last paycheck. It’s not small but not big $$ but I want to know if they have any legal grounding to it. I’d honestly rather not pay it back given this isn’t the first time they messed up my payroll and I wasted a lot of back and forth time while working with them. Anybody know if I’m liable? Great to know! Will do, thanks for your help all Yes, if they overpaid you, you have to pay it back.  Location matters. In the United States you would be obligated to repay them. The terms vary somewhat state by state, but I don't know of a state that limits their period of recovery to less than 3 months. Just as if they underpaid you, you would want them to make it right. You are owed money for time worked and nothing more. If they over paid you need to pay it back. If you don't they can sue and win.
