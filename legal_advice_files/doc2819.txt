 Things are rough, really rough right now at home. It’s all my fault. I’m (M,22) having trouble sleeping in my room, keep thinking someone is gonna knock at my bedroom door and say they forgive me. This whole thing might pass, but my sleep has genuinely been crappy. Can I sleep in my car tonight on our street where I usually park? Just throw some blankets? Or will the cops tow my car and arrest me. Your post has been removed for the following reason(s): Bad or Illegal Advice Your post has been removed for offering poor legal advice.

The Brentwood OP refers to is in Contra Costa County, which is indisputably in northern California. You can call the police and ask, or look for your city's laws. Some quick Googling led me to this: [http://qcode.us/codes/brentwood/?view=desktop topic=8-8\_00-8\_00\_030](http://qcode.us/codes/brentwood/?view=desktop topic=8-8_00-8_00_030) ..which seems to say it's illegal (see part G). (P.S. if you think Brentwood is Northern CA I'm not sure what you think Southern CA is). Additionally, even if you can get away with it, be sure to protect yourself. DO NOT be in the car while intoxicated. How can I find out? (Brentwood, fwiw). Depends on your city. Some cities have strict laws on sleeping in your car on the street.
