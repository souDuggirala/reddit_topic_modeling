  Last weekend my car was booted in an Austin, Texas parking lot. After I paid the $100 fee and went home I reviewed Austin's ordinance for car booting. I immediately noticed that the company booting the car violated section [ยง 13-7-42 (A) (6)](=TIT13TRSE_CH13-7VEIMSE_ART4VEIMRE_S13-7-42REINREBO) of Austin's ordinance: \[The booting company employee\] is required to wear high-visibility retro-reflective safety apparel when installing or removing a boot. While a fairly minor detail, this violation is important because it enables the booting company to more effectively catch people by appearing to be loitering in the parking lot rather than monitoring activity. I returned to the parking lot area a few days later and recorded a video to document this violation. Would violating the ordinance be an argument for dismissing the fee under [Texas Occupations Code Chapter 2308 Subchapter J]()? They are only required to wear it while installing or removing a boot. Waiting to catch someone prior to booting a vehicle doesn't require they wear one. The ordinance exists for the safety of their workers, not so they are visible to violators.  Do you have evidence that shows this when your vehicle was being booted?  You have no evidence they violated the ordinance in your case. The requirement is to wear the equipment while installing or removing, not at all times.
