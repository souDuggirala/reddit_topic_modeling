  Our Google play developer account has been terminated due to a prior violation of associated accounts. We have been publishing educational applications for years compliant with the Google Play developer policy. We really don't know the exact reason for termination that we never had a purpose of violating the policy. So this decision made us so upset and disappointed although we are ready to solve what problem is. My clean, policy-compliant developer account has been terminated due to associated accounts that I had 1 million downloaded app on it. I have tried to reach them, explained it has nothing to do with the banned account but I have received same automatic messages. My petition I am depressed and frustrated because of that. I haven’t done any violations to loss my developer account. I can’t reach them.  What part of the termination of your account do you believe is illegal and why?
