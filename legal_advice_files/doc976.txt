 Going to buy a car next weekend for (most likely) $13,000 and need some advice. I took out a car loan through a lending provider for $10,000 as I'll be putting a downpayment on the rest, and in the loan application I wrote that the purchase price of the vehicle was $10,000 (I couldn't input anything more than the loan amount). I took out a cashier's check for $11,800 through my bank in anticipation of the sale as I'm assuming this is as low as I can bargain them down. If it ends up being $13,000, I'll just pay $1,200 cash to them. My question is, when I transfer everything to the DMV, if I put the purchase price as $10,000 (which is what is reported to the lending company, who will be on the title until i pay them off) could either the seller or myself get in trouble? If it's $11,800, will the DMV or the State check my bank statements, or theirs (when they cash my cashiers check) to verify this price? Will this come up as a tax issue for 2019 when either of us are filing taxes in 2020? Thank you for any advice. I've never done this before so I'm not sure if it's normal to put the amount I had to state to the loan provider as the selling price.  Legally, you need to report the actual purchase price to the DMV.
