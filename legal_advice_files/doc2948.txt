 I go to a high school in Cobb County, Georgia and I drive to school every day. Our school is under construction, so we have a much smaller amount of parking spaces in the school. To make up for it, they "rented" spaces from a neighboring public park. Every spot that was marked for students to park in had "LHS" painted on the parking spot. About 100 or so spots were painted. I got to school later than I usually do (1st period starts at 8:20 AM, I got to the parking lot at 8:08 AM), and saw that there weren't any spots left. Other students were driving in and saw this as well. So, I parked in a spot not labeled "LHS." I walked out today to find a parking ticket on my car. The citation says I violated the "Cobb County Schools Protection Ordinance" by parking in an "Unauthorized or Prohibited Area." (Sec. 81-31 of the Georgia Law) However, I parked in a public park, where all day parking is free and legal. There really wasn't anything in the ticket that specifically said this situation was illegal, or that we HAD to park in an "LHS" marked spot. So, do I have a basis to fight the ticket, by saying parking in a public park is free and unlimited whether you are a student or was this within the officer's ability? Since I wasn't on school property, would I be subject to my school's traffic law?
