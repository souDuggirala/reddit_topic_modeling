I basically paid $189 for posters that OSHA offers for free. I am a sole proprietor and have no employees. Is there any way to reverse this. I am an idiot. 
 It does suck.  It's such a weirdly specific scam.  I spent days on the phone with those thieves trying to get that boss' money back, but no dice.  Sorry they got you.  :/ OMG.  .  10 times ... Someone in your life should step in and say something at that point. Unfortunately a Google search will too I had a boss that fell for this scam for *years* before I came along.  He just thought it was an annual cost of doing business.  Got a nice bonus when I showed him how to get them for free.  It pisses me off that the feds don't crack down on this scam, because they convince people that there's no other way to do it.  But you did willingly pay them for products that they will presumably supply, so you're probably out of luck.  I'd advise taking out all your frustrations on them when they contact you next year, and don't fall for it again.  Be glad you didn't do it ten or twelve times before you caught on. I did file a claim with my business debit card, in order for it to be reversed I have to not actually receive the posters. I haven't received them yet but I'm sure I will. I pay for lots of things I don’t need to pay for. OP may be able to argue it’s some sort of scam, but if OP agreed to pay then the simple fact that they could have been obtained for free isn’t relevant. Your credit card company will reverse the charges if you call and tell them product not as advertised and explain it’s something you did need to pay for that you were charged for.
