 Hello, First off I’m in Illinois (Cook County) I recently attempted to purchase a device from the Google Device Store. Due to illness and generally scheduling errors I had to contact Google to have them request FedEx to divert my package to a location where I can pick it up. Unfortunately, in the process FedEx lost my package, or at least according to them they don’t currently know where it is but are working on finding it (for 6 days). Long story short since then I have spent roughly 10 days trying to get someone to talk to me from Google since they placed restrictions on the package making it so FedEx refuses to assist me since I’m not the shipper. This has resulted in 8 phone calls, 20 hours of hold music, 8 hours of chat support (who told me they can’t help because a supervisor is handling it), 27 emails (3 replies from good support saying they’re working with FedEx), 15 Direct Messages to their Twitter support (no answers). I’ve disputed the charge with the credit card company since I would already be required to start paying on it by now and was wondering my next steps. Should I wait until the dispute is finished or can I take Google to Small Claims demanding refund and payment for time? I found this in their terms of sale and was wondering if this means I have no case, or can I argue that they violated their own conditions by violating SLA on their support promise? "GOOGLE PARTIES") SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (WHETHER CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE) FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEVICE OR THESE TERMS, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT A GOOGLE PARTY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING. YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE GOOGLE PARTIES' TOTAL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEVICE OR THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO GOOGLE UNDER THESE TERMS. Any advice is much appreciated. So I just got a answer that can make this moot. Google contacted me confirming that the package is a failed delivery but refuse refund because the fault lies on FedEx, however FedEx TOS state that due to the restrictions on the account they will only provide refund to the shipper. I guess this is the end. I just need to work on trying to get something from someone else. Thanks for taking the time, I truly appreciate it.  's on their support site. 24-48 hours for first contact and a established SLA of 5 business days for resolution. Go ahead and come back when you can post the SLA terms you think Google breached. (And when you do, please include a link so we can review the SLA.) Woops! Sorry, misread your question. Yes I can't get a screenshot right now but they have listed SLA's on their support site. 24-48 hours for first contact and a established SLA of 5 business days for resolution. The communications I have received have also promised contact or resolution within 48 hours repeatedly. And those promises have repeatedly been broken.  : I specifically asked if the TOS say that Google would provide a response within a particular amount of time. I don't see that in what you quoted. In fact, I don't see a promise to provide support at all. Please highlight the parts that answer my question. And while you're doing it, you might want to think about exactly what allegation of breach of contract you plan to make. Because at this point, I don't see any promise by Google that you claim they breached. Yes: Edit Additionally Google themselves have admitted that the device will not be delivered.  Do the TOS say that you will receive a response within a particular amount of time? I don't think they are. They are however responsible for providing customer support since they set restrictions on FedEx allowing them to refuse assistance to me, the customer. The issue is that Google is refusing assistance or reimbursement. Edit: More specifically the issue isn't the lost package it's the refusal of support from Google which is costing me time and money to resolve due to that refusal.  Why do you think Google is liable for FedEx's mistake?
