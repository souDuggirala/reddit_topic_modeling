 For example, the rapper 2Pac was under scrutiny by Delores Tucker and mentioned her in one of his songs. She proceeded to sue him claiming it "inflicted emotional distress, were slanderous and invaded her privacy." The case was eventually dismissed. I'm wondering what one can legally say about someone they don't like in a public forum of any kind, whether it's music released to the public, social media, radio, television, etc. before you run into issues like the aforementioned one.
