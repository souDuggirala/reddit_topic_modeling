 I'm an 18 year old male and on Thursday I got rear ended on the highway. I have liability and the woman who hit me said she had insurance, but the card was expired. I got her information and filed a police report and a claim with insurance. Her insurance called me the next day to tell me that she doesn't have a current policy with them, so they can't do anything about it. The estimated damage to the car was $6,000 and to be completely honest I have no idea what I'm going to do. The car isn't drivable at the moment so I've been borrowing my moms car (haven't gotten a rental because theres no one to pay for it) and I'm taking steps to see how much it would be to get the car drivable. The legal advice I need is in regards to the next steps of this process. The car if totaled is most likely worth around $4,000. Do I sue her in small claims court? (not really sure how all of that works) I have a little bit of money in savings, but definitely not enough for a new car. I appreciate any and all help with this, Thank you. It varies by jurisdiction. Sometimes you can garnish wages. Other times you have to look into their assets and try to collect from there. Oh. Didn't see that for a second. OP only has iability so they can't go thru their own insurance. Suing the other driver is their only option Forgive me for my lack of knowledge on how the legal process works, but how does collecting work? is it done in court?  Go though your insurance. A whole lot easier than suing. Sue her in small claims court for the value of the car. You will want to bring estimates for repair showing the cost to repair the car is greater than its value. Unfortunately, someone who doesnâ€™t have insurance is unlikely to have money. You may win in court but find it hard to collect.
