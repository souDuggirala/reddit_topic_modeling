 Letâ€™s say that I take a public domain story like Gift of the Magi by O. Henry, and turn it into a dramatically-narrated audiobook and (for good measure) a print version with large type and original illustrations. Since the work is in the public domain, am I free to just go to press to sell these works?   Yes. Go for it.
