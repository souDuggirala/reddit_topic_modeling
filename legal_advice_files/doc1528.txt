 Not sure if you guys saw that post on r/CrazyIdeas, but it basically suggested we all copyright strike 1 video, at which point they will appeal and we dont respond until we have to and continue claiming it right until the point of legal action, say ‘oopsies wrong video lol’ and then the next person does it, essentially holding the revenue hostage. The point is to make YouTube fix their heavily biased system by using it against them. What would be some realistic consequences if someone or a group attempted this?
