 So full details are here: [\_for\_getting\_angry\_at\_the\_leasing\_office/]() TL;DR: accidentally missed a rent payment, landlord blocked online payments and issued a 3-day unconditional notice to vacate. I decided to get a cashier's check and call their bluff the next day; they dropped it. Someone there mentioned that in CA the landlord has to maintain access to every payment option even if you accidentally miss a payment. I'm curious if this is true in Texas too. How does your lease say you can pay and does it say anything about this?
