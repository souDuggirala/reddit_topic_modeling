 # I didn't realize how severe the situation was until he lost facebook access and sent me a plea for help so he can return to his friends, his girlfriend, and I was helping him be social and get a summer job. He can stay with us. Is there a way I can appeal the New Lenox location? Should I avoid a lawyer? Pretend you're someone who doesn't know anything about you, your friend, where you are, or what is going on here. Would this post make sense? Not a shred. So let's start over, you need to rewrite this with the understanding that we don't know why he's there, how he got there, or why he should be released.
