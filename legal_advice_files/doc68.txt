 An online catfish offered to pay off my credit card and I accepted it. At the time I believed who they said they were, and I don’t make much money so I thought this was an amazing opportunity. I now believe she’s not who really owned the bank account that paid for my debt. I tried calling my financial office and they said it’s too late and the payment has posted. Am I in some serious shit? What should I do next? Yeah I blocked them already, they started getting toxic Don't respond to them and block them if their messages are bothering you. No I’m not You aren't actually sending them money right? Thanks! I’ve let my issuer know what happened, but they said they can’t do anything about it. Now the catfish is very persistent that I PayPal what I owe them. Except the charge to be reversed and your account will be closed and you will owe the balance due. Criminal charges are unlikely since it's not clear you really broke any laws or intended to. You haven't committed fraud, but you were in the middle of being a victim of fraud. The next step in this scam was going to be to ask you to pay for something or to send them money - generally via bitcoin, western union, or some other hard-to-trace method that can't be reversed. When the payments to your card are reversed (and they will be), you would have been left holding the bag. Let your credit card issuer know someone made payments on your behalf that you believe may have been fraudulent, and be ready when those payments are reversed.
