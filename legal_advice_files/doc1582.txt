 As the title says. The company provides editing and proofreading services. I have edited and proofread a document, and the company decided the editing job did not meet their standards. I offered to redo the order. The company has again decided that the editing job did not meet their standards and have provided minimal feedback as to what was wrong with the order. This particular company is known for doing this to their contractors to keep customers happy sometimes. Is it legal for this company to withhold 100% of my payment for this order because they decided they did not like my work?  However, if you believe your client is making unreasonable use of that clause to try to avoid payment on completed work, rather than making good faith use of it to deal with an incomplete or inadequate job, you can make that argument in court. It might sway a small claims judge: a term which purportedly allows one party to, arbitrarily, reduce the amount owing based on a subjective factor is at least debatable. Thanks for the quick answer. Their contract basically states that they can deduct any amount due to the contractor if they deem the contractor has not performed services in a satisfactory manner. I was just wondering if that was legal, as I've had an attorney look at other parts of the contract for me and literally laugh out loud. So it would basically be a small claims issue and entirely up to a judge? It's legal in as much as the police won't get involved. If you're not willing to renegotiate or walk away, and if they're breaching the terms of their contract, you can take them to court. If it's under $25,000, this is a small claims issue. A judge will decide whether to enforce the contract as written, accept their argument that you breached the contract by failing to provide adequate service, or both.
