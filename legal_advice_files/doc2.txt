 Ontario, Canada Hey guys, my insurance broker sent me a “renewal application” (April, 2019) that I had to complete for them to be able to determine their renewal terms, before my current policy ended (May 1, 2019). I never heard back from them, and they never sent anything else for me to sign. I’ve been with them for two years, and each year they required me to sign the policy and requested payment immediately. Because I did not hear back from them, I assumed that the policy was never renewed. They did not send me a new policy or requested any payment. This was fine for me because I decided to end business operations this summer, because the business was not going well. Just to clarify, the renewal application is a “Renewal Questionnaire” in their correspondence they wrote: Renewals are NOT automatically continued past expiry and ample lead time for the Underwriters to consider offering renewal terms is required. ———— The questionnaire that I signed and completed was asking for gross receipts, any new employees, change in operations etc. I told them that I never signed a new policy with them, and that they never requested any payment, or confirm with me that I had a new policy in effect. The questionnaire is definitely very generic, and I would agree that it was nothing more than a form to gather more information for them to prepare a quote. Thanks for your help. Just don’t want them to send this to collections and take a hit on my credit score etc. It would depend on the wording of the questionnaire. Normally though, that is not biding. It merely serves as a way to get a quote. Just concerned about the invoice they sent me saying I am past due, and if there is anything that I legally owe them. Or if the policy continues because I sent them a “renewal application/questionnaire”. To me it does seem black and white, but wanted the thoughts of others if there is something that legally binds me to this.  OK. That's what you should have done. So what's the question?
