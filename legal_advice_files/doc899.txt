 After a year and a half of dealing with constantly recurring bedbugs, I’m moving out of an awful apartment complex. When I schedule my final walkthrough, I find out that management wants me to pay for the carpets to be cleaned before they even go on a walkthrough of the apartment with me. About $100 to clean a perfectly fine carpet and they haven’t even looked at it yet to know if its excessively damaged. Apparently I agreed to it in my lease but I won’t be able to look at that until tomorrow, but I was under the impression that in South Carolina I can’t be made to pay for normal wear and tear, does this stipulation they snuck into my lease overrule that? If I refuse to pay what am I on the hook for? I’ll be going over there tomorrow morning to look at my lease and get the exact wording but I don’t want to throw away my money when I’ve left the carpet as good or better than I found it.  Yea, I thought it was standard to paint the walls and clean the carpets between tenants as well. You typically only pay if your wear and tear is considered excessive. Double check that lease. Put your soft goods in a dryer to heat up to kill any bed bugs so you don’t take them with you.  This is pretty standard for the places I have lived with a lease. If the place was a nightmare be done with it and move on.  If you agreed to it in the lease, you are pretty much on the hook for it. The will deduct the fee from the security deposit most likely.
