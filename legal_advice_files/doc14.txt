 We move out on Sept. 27th but landlord charged us for full month of September. I asked to be reimbursed for the last 3 days and the landlord said NO - that once we move out they will provide a statement showing any charges for damages, etc and that the reimbursement will be reflected there. Is this legal? This doesn't seem right to me. We overpaid and we should be reimbursed, not have to wait a month and then have it "deducted" from possible charges. I am not sure how to respond to property managers email. Not a Lawyer. Firstly, as rentals are typically monthly, reimbursing you for a few days would be unusual in my experience. Not extremely so, but unusual. Secondly, they would typically have a "reasonable" timeframe to repay any overpayment. "Reasonable" varies quite a bit, but 30-45 days is usually considered "Reasonable", and by co-incidence, they have 45 days to return any security deposit and itemized damage claims. Lastly, while you probably have the right to demand the reimbursement be separated from everything else, do you really care enough to both annoy your former landlord and just add another check to the process? we gave notice we were leaving the 27th and that is what our move-out letter states as well. i just didn't realize i was paying full rent till after i submitted payment. and now they wont reimburse us those days until after we move out. When you have notice did the period actually end on the 27th? Or you have notice for the end of the month and then just loved out a few days early?
