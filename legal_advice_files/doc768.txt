 Some questions ask things like how many other times did you drive impaired. I'm trying to take this class seriously and learn from it, but it also seems kind of shady to admit in writing that I have driven impaired other times before I was arrested. Am I just being overly cautious, or should I not admit to anything? Thank you very much.  If that question has an awkward answer, then you probably need this DUI class more than you realize.  Yes, but it will be used in deciding how many hours of clases and such you need. It's not a trap. It's intended to have you sincerely evaluate your driving and drinking behavior. There is no possible way for a prosecutor to make a DUI charge based on an admission of that type. DUI charges require specific locations and observations and measurements and observations, none of which are present in such an admission. Nor could such an admission be used in court in any way; an admission that you have committed an un-charged and un-convicted crime in the past cannot be introduced into evidence to prove that you committed the crime for which you are being tried. "What's your nickname, sir ?" "Killer Dave" "I see. No more questions, Your Honor." Recollect, reflect, and answer truthfully.
