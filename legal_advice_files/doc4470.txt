  I am located in Virginia , Petersburg. My wages have been garnished for a debt which was discharged when I filed for bankruptcy last March 2017. About two weeks ago I received my first garnishment including the cost associated with it. I received a copy of the court summon and notification from my Employers HR office, a few days before my first garnishment. As soon as I found out, I did send an objection letter to the court with a copy of my Bankruptcy discharge paperwork as proof that the debt was discharged. However, I didn't hear anything back yet, although I did send the letter with signature confirmation. Yesterday, I found out that another $400.09 was taken out of my salary again. I cant afford to loose more money. I been employed as a DoD employee for 20 years and have been so embarrassed about all this. I contacted the creditors again and finally did get a hold of them. I faxed them a copy of the discharge paperwork and they apologized for their mistake and are willing to reverse the Garnishment. However, I am emotionally distressed and out of money and I have a garnishment court hearing on January 15, 2019, but my wages have been garnished already, and I never had a chance to contest this in a timely manner. Now I am stuck wit a judgement and difficulty paying my rent for something which is not my fault. What are my options? Can the judgement be vacated ? and how can I make this all go away?
