 So I'm aware that if the landlord refuses to fix something, legally, you can withhold rent until it is fixed, but I'm not sure if this counts for any kind of repair, or if it's life-altering (like no heat, no electricity, etc.) My issue is, my water temperature has been shitty since July when the water in my apartment was turned off for construction. Everything was fairly normal before that, but since then, I've had it where it takes 15+ minutes for my kitchen sink water to get warm to wash dishes, and at one point my shower water stopped getting warm altogether. Now, after I've put in at least 5 work orders over the past few months, the water in my shower only gets boiling lava hot (where I literally can't take a shower because it will scald me) or ice cold. I know it's not exactly life threatening but it's getting to the point where it takes me 20 minutes or more to barely find a setting that my body can tolerate when I need to take a shower. Is there anything I can do? It feels like the plumbers for my apartment complex aren't testing things when they've adjusted whatever is going wrong with the plumbing, and I feel helpless because the landlord is the only communication between me and them but they haven't been helpful with the issue either. I'm at the point where I feel like the only way to make these people care is to do something legally so they'll have to finally take some action.
