 My fiance proposed in November, and we've been looking over the requirements of the K1 fiance visa. I'm worried about whether or not he's going to be accepted. He has a history of mental illness, self harm and drug abuse. His last hospitalization was two years ago, and he's been doing well in treatment and staying off of drugs, which is reflecting in his patient notes, but looking at the questionnaire you have to fill out for the medical exam has got me worried. Do you think they would approve his K1 visa? Are there certain steps we should take, and if he doesn't get approved, is there another way I could get him here? I really appreciate the help. Thank you for the response! I know it's not the easiest question, I just needed some idea of where he's at. I appreciate the time you took to look into this for me.  Generally though: Individuals who are current drug addicts or abusers are inadmissible. Generally, if the person can remain off drugs for 12 months, they'll be considered in remission and are then cease to be inadmissible for drug reasons.
