 I work at a clinic that provides legal help to financially unable people. We work for free and never have contracts, we never work as their lawyers we simply help them fill complaints, motions, etc. They're still pro se parties. To gain court experience sometimes we go and ask if they want help, say putting proofs on the record and act as their attorney solely during that engagement. We were representing a lady but we found out that the husband was abusing the child and they were asking for sharing of parenting time. We instantly stopped out representation as we felt uncomfortable going on - and we work for free so we can pick our clients. I don't think the abuse is life-threatening but it could be found to be. He would give this minor alcohol regularly and force her to drink it (there may be more but that's what we know). Is there a way without breaching patient-client confidentiality that we can get this information out? Neither the plaintiff or defendant made any of this prevalent at court. Thanks in advance.
