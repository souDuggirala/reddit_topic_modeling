 My boyfriend and I do not plan on marrying but I would like to adopt his biological son. We have been together 6 years, since his son was 7 years old. His mother passed away 2 years ago so we do not have to worry about her releasing her rights. I'm not sure where to began or if it's even possible. Also, another contingent here is he receives his mother's social security check and I dont know what effect an adoption would have on that. Any suggestions? Social Security benefits will end if you adopt the child. He would no longer get a check and in most states, itâ€™s not possible to adopt without marriage.
