If 2 family members have passed in the last couple years, and one of them kept you from the other, and a lady who is a felon (including fraud, burglary, and negligence) was left everything and she is very vindictive and shady, there is no getting a policy number from her.. but there IS an insurance policy unclaimed that she DID NOT receive (she made that very clear in her threatening texts)... How do I go about even finding out who the beneficiary is at that point? Thank you in advance and I know this is probably just an easy question to Google but I'm currently having a Google software glitch and cannot utilize most things Google. Any information is much appreciated.
