 The employee was fired after the review of security footage. My wife went in to make an official statement and asked for the video which the owner told her she could have when they spoke after the incident. They denied her the video and pulled her to the side. The head chef who was the direct supervisor of the employee who assaulted her (they were friends) told her “don’t tell anyone because we don’t want you feel weird here. We don’t want this to hurt the restaurant.” My wife is going to the police today to report what happened. She is now feeling like if she makes “trouble” for them she will be fired or that they are hiding something. #Is going to the police the right thing? Is she protected from the employer if this becomes a problem for them? Going to the police is the right thing to do.
