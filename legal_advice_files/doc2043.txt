 Say I wanted to make the Skyrim map in exact detail, or make and sell the stuffed animals from Fallout 76, or in game artwork, and sell it. How legal/illegal is this? I see people make and sell stuff like this all of the time, but I donâ€™t want to open myself up for getting sued. I am not a rich person.  Yes of course. That is squarely and obviously their property. You can ask their permission to make and sell one, they can and will say no.
