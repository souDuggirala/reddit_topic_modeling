 okay I see people taking other people's contents on fb all the time. I'm thinking to do the same for my fb page, but I must admit I'm scared. isn't it illegal/? but the thing is I see the same post on different pages all the time? they just put their logo on the top right and that's it. Will I get into a serious trouble if I do that for my fb page?
