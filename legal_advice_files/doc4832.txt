 This has all happened within the last week. On the 17th we noticed a leak from our bathroom ceiling and we called our apartments management office to notify them when they opened on the 18th. Nothing happened until I called again on the 20th. Between the first and second call the small leak changed into a flooded bathroom and part of a hallway. Our neighbor below us also had flooding from this leak in their bathroom directly below us. When the on-site staff arrived on the 20th to check it out, they found it was a main line water pipe that broke and he was sorry that he was only notified this morning when he got into work and saw it on the pile of work orders. Since then they have fixed the pipe, but only replaced the padding under the carpet and put a dehumidifier in the bathroom. The smell from the flooded area and damaged carpet has kept my wife and I out of the apartment since the 20th. What are our rights as far as moving out or breaking our lease? My father in law is telling us they need a mold test to be done and that they should be paying for a hotel room while this is being fixed, but we are not sure how to approach this from a legal standpoint. We want to leave because of the management's negligence in fixing this before it became a massive problem, but we don't want to get sued if we can avoid it.
