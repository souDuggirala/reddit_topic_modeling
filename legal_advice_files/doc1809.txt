 Hi, around 6 weeks ago I had an incident were someone was supposed to buy a phone from me (contacted through OfferUp). but instead he stole the phone from me. I meet with the police and the office asked me if I want him to be arrested I said no I just want the phone back. Fast forward to now I called to check on the investigation and I was informed that there is no investigation because I did not want the person to be arrested at the time I didn’t know that I have to ask for an arrest to get my phone back and the first officer did not inform me. I told them can I make a new case and they said no because you are already have one and it’s closed. So is there anything I can do to get me phone back? They can absolutely turn him down.  Gather his info and sue him in small claims court. You have no other real recourse.  Will do thanks  report the phone as stolen to your carrier and they’ll blacklist the IMEI and make it unusable  You can go back and let the PD know you changed your mind and want to pursue charges against this person. They may give you a hard time but go to the police dept to file the complaint. They really can’t turn you down.  At the time I did not know. However is there anything else I can do for now ? In order for an investigation to take place (if you’re in the states) you would need to sign a complaint, meaning having him arrested. Since you declined, then there is no case. They won’t chase the guy down for you and take the phone from him. When you sign a complaint you’re basically authorizing an arrest and agreeing to testify against him in court.  I have the account that the person used to contact me and he lists stuff for sale Cops aren’t the boogie man. Nor are they the repo man. You get your stuff stolen, be prepared to go all the way if you expect them to. Do you have any idea who has your phone or where they are?
