 She lived with me, Rent free in my dads home, for three years. Her ID, which is an instruction permit, has my address. We broke up in September of 18. She moved out but left a ton of her stuff. She stayed with a relative and paid rent. I continued to help her get to work. They lost the apartment recently and I mistakenly let her come back just this past Thursday. Now, all of her belongings are here and also a car. Which she doesn’t have a license to drive, still only a permit. She never changed addresses so it’s still at this residence. We realized it will not work out. We argued a bit. With me telling her I want her moving out. She says I need to get an eviction notice. She even threatened to have the cops called for hitting her. I didn’t hit her. Once she said that are started recording. The recording got her kicking me and trying to cover the camera. I don’t want to do anything to get her in trouble though. She had a friend outside and packed a few items and left. This is in WV. I will delete this post after a bit due to her frequenting reddit. i just want to know what I need to do in order to get her out of my house permanently.
