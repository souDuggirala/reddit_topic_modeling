I was working for a company in NYC, and decided to move out of state. My company decided to allow me to work remotely and shipped me a MacBook Pro, Rain Stand, and Thunderbolt display. A month after I begin working remote, my boss tells me I should start looking for a new job because "this was meant to be temporary" even though none of that was communicated to me (had I known the non-permanent nature I would never agreed to the remote work). Four years later and I still have the display and Rain Stand. The laptop was destroyed in a fire, which my former employer is aware of. I have made efforts to contact my former boss to get a shipping label but have never gotten one. Is there ever a point that this property is considered forfeited by them, or am I on the hook for this stuff forever until it gets returned to them somehow? [removed] I don't want to pay out of pocket to send it back, mostly.  Why don't you just return it?
