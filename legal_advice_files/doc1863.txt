 I'm posting here because my parents suggested this might be something I need to report to someone. Basically, my community college advertises this program as being a one-year certificate, with five courses each semester for two semesters. The problem is that several of the courses in the program are gated behind prerequisite courses, and the prerequisites aren't in the degree plan. This means my financial aid doesn't cover the prerequisites and they would make the certificate take longer even if it did, so each time I get to one of them (it's taking me two years because I have a full-time job) I have to get a prerequisite waiver from the department chair before I can register. This semester, the class was only half full when I requested the waiver, but it's been 10 days and they still haven't responded and now the class is full (that is, it's an online course with 20 seats and all 20 seats are now taken). That means I can't finish my certificate this semester as planned. This seems pretty wrong to me. Is there some regulating agency I can report this to?  It is also pretty common to have prerequisites. It can sometimes be covered in a longer program that would be covered in financial aid so you could look at that.  I will contact them. Thank you! I'm sure Texas has a state department of education. That would be your best best.
