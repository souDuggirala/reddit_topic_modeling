 I’m an amateur embroiderer and I sometimes sell shirts. I recently made a custom order for someone I do not know personally and they wanted me to use a certain design made by a tattoo artist. I earned money from this order. I tried contacting the tattoo artist to ask him if I could use his design but he never responded to me and I made the shirt and sent it out to the customer anyway. 2 weeks later, today, I got a comment on my instagram post (a post showing the shirt I made and explaining it was a custom order) from the artist saying “this is my design!” I don’t want any trouble at all, I am willing to give him some of the profits. All of it if i have to, I don’t want a lawsuit or anything. But I want to know what are the laws regarding using someone else’s design for a custom order? I am not actively making products with his design, just one order that was requested. Any help is appreciated. (If necessary to know, I am in Utah. Sent order to California, don’t know where the tattoo artist is from)
