 I’ve tested for radon within the house I rent, where the master bedroom is in the basement, and while I’m waiting for the results I’ve wondered if it’s an issue, who would be responsible for installing a mitigation system, me or the landlord? I’d think a severe cancer risk would warrant a ventilation system... This said, couldn't find anything state specific but you may have better luck. []() ## Radon No laws require landlords to identify radon or remove it from the property, despite its association with lung cancer. It has been found in every state and can be a severe hazard when it is trapped in homes that have problems with insulation or ventilation. You may want to test for radon in your unit yourself, especially if you live in an area where there are substantial amounts of uranium in the soil and rock. Since it is hard to remove radon from a home once it has entered it, the focus is usually on keeping it out. However, these methods are often cumbersome and expensive, such as equalizing the pressure in the basement or foundation of the property or venting radon from the soil into the air through a pipe. You cannot take these steps on your own, so you will need to convince the landlord to take them if needed. You can hire a professional to test for radon and determine whether it makes your home uninhabitable. If it does, you can demand that the landlord fix the problem, and you may need to move out temporarily. If the landlord fails to act promptly, you can break your lease and move out without needing to pay future rent. I’m wondering if there’s an obligation on their part? Home owner I believe.
