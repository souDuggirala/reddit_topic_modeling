 I used to live in Florida with two roommates on a year long lease. I left in the middle, but have continued to pay rent and left my portion of the security deposit as well. Our lease ends January 31, however they’ve signed a new lease for the same unit without me on it. Our current lease says that the security deposit is only returned when the unit is vacated. Which means even though it’s a new lease, the same security deposit stays. So I can’t get my money back directly from the apartment. And my roommates have told me they won’t be paying it back when the lease ends, but when they get a new roommate to cover it. I’ve offered them a payment plan and have very directly stated that I’d like them to pay me back on January 31 to reimburse me for my portion of the deposit. Do I have any legal rights to force them to pay me back if they don’t when the lease ends? The apartment is within their rights to hold my deposit though, since the unit has not been vacated, right? But, my roommates are not within their rights (?) to use my money to pay their security deposit?  You can always sue- Whether or not you can win is another story. The terms of your lease agreement explain that the deposit is returned when the unit is vacated, so this is not really a concern of your ex roommates- They aren't the ones who took your security deposit. I'd suggest contacting the landlord to try and work it out, especially if you were signed out of the lease. I think you'd have a better chance with legal action against them as opposed to the roommates, if needed.
