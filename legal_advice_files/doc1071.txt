 Speed limit was 65 and I got caught at 92 (not sure how, I usually drive at 75 on that route). I also had an out of state license, and got cited for driving without a license. The police told me I should get a CA license before court date (end of March) and the judge may dismiss that charge. That's what I will do. I'm worried about my insurance spiking. I researched traffic attorneys, and it looks like I should hire one since they'll help keep the points off my record and save me money. But I'm not sure. Can someone tell me how they work? I don't want to pay them a few hundred bucks and ended up having to still pay for the spike in insurance and traffic ticket.  Get the license before hand and you’ll be good. For the speeding, pay the fine and ask for traffic school. Can even ask for a fine reduction while in front of judge.  You need a new license and new registration usually within 30 days of moving, unless it’s temporary (like moving for college). You should also update your residence on your insurance and banking and so on. Get it Monday. You can find what you need to bring online. Usually you need your old license, some bills at your new place or a mortgage or lease, and then you likely need to do the eye test and all that. Get a license in your new State ASAP and it might be dropped. Regardless, you need a license where you live now. Yes I moved but didn't know I had to get a new license.
