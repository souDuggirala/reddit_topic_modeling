 Hey Personal Finance. I hope someone can help me. I’m legally married in California. My ex and I separated in September of 2017 and she left the USA. Last tax season she gave me documents to file joint, but since then It’s been an uphill battle to find her and get her to agree to anything. In July of 2018 we got an immigration lawyer to help her forfeit her green card status. She turned it and her social security card to the US embassy of her home country as instructed in December 2018. She only now signed the divorce documents we are filing next week. So I was legally married in CA all of 2018. What status do I file as? If I have to file as married, how can I do that if she’s no longer considered a US resident, doesn’t live in the US, and doesn’t have a social security number? She had no income last year either. Appreciate any advice.
