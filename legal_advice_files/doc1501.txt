 We live in an apartment complex and she’s always leaving trash in front/near my door just so she doesn’t have to put it in front of her apartment. I tried talking to her and she just starting yelling at me and cursing me out when I was just trying to talk. I don’t intend to cause any physical damage to her property or anything like that. She’s just completely disrespectful and I have to walk by her apartment to get to mine.  Those are solid parameters. Yes it's legal See You’re right. I was just annoyed and not thinking completely rationally. I will just let the apartment manager deal with it. I know there have already been multiple complaints about her since I’ve heard the security guards at her door various times and she just yells and acts crazy towards them as well. That “make remarks” comment is going to get a whole lot more plausible if she has video of you flipping off her camera several times a day Yeah I intend to do this tomorrow morning. This incident just occurred right now so I was just mad and trying to being petty in a legal way. She has security cameras and says she always watches me walk and supposedly sees me “make remarks” about her, which is not true. I just walk by with my dog minding my own business.  Pretty much this. Have the apartment management deal with her. Also you can get a security cam and place it so you can catch her in the act if she keeps putting garbage at your front door.  Not a lawyer. But believe first amendment rights are on your side. As long as you don't shit on his doorstop, you should be ok. It’s probably protected expression but I don’t know whether it could be characterized as harassing conduct. Serious question: rather than this passive aggressive shit why not just go talk to the management of your apartment complex? Usually they have rules in the lease about waste disposal which they could enforce against your neighbor.
