 I am a labor and delivery nurse working for a hospital and this morning, another nurse and I were told that we had committed time card fraud by the charge nurse. I am also a charge nurse but my friend who was also told this is not. There is no proof of this having been done because we had committed no such act despite the charge nurse’s claims that there are witnesses and “undeniable proof”. I am being told that it is extremely likely I am to be fired by our boss and I cannot do anything about it because charge nurses are not protected by our union because we are considered management. My friend is safer due to the fact that she is protected by our union. The only thing I could see us having done that could be wildly misconstrued as this is that the other nurse didn’t go to lunch and asked me to mark it down that she did not go to lunch. I must have marked something wrong as that is the only explanation but doing so would only have given my friend an extra 25$ and we make very good paychecks so we would not have committed fraud for something so dumb and small. Any help or advice in this matter would be appreciated and is there any legal action that can be taken to combat this or my firing?  OP- it seems like you're not certain what the supposed 'fraud' is. Your first step is to make sure you're on the same page with your employer.
