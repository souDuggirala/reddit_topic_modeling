 I wrote a 147 page story and sent it to a publisher in 2012 (I won’t publicly name the publishing company). I just watched a Netflix tv show with the exact same story line, and came to find out it was based on a book published in 2014 by the exact publishing company I sent my story to. I just finished the first 50 pages of “novelist’s” book, and it is 3 words away from being identical to what I wrote. Does this qualify as intellectual property theft? Or anything? I have undeniable proof. Should I contact a lawyer?  Thank you. I’ve found one in my area and am in touch now.  yes, contact an IP attorney
