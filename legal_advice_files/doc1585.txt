 I rent in an apartment building with a garage. An assigned spot is designated in my lease. As I came home from work tonight, I noticed a "TOW AWAY" sign in my parking space indicating that there was no parking between the hours of 7AM-5PM from tomorrow 1/17 through 1/24. They are installing electric vehicle chargers into some parking spaces. I received no notice for this. I searched my lease agreement for "parking" and found the following: \ and in another area \ Nothing else in my lease agreement describes anything about denial of use to my assigned parking space for any reason. Does my landlord have the right to deny access to my designated parking space within less than 24 hours notice? What should I do here? Thank you in advance. Thanks. To update, I spoke with the landlord and they said that the construction company put the signs up without notifying them. She said everything is fine and nobody is getting towed. What's in your lease is what matters, don't listen to this person. Speak to your landlord and see if it can be resolved. unfortunately the leasing office closes at 5PM. They open at 9AM, two hours after the time listed on the tow signage. Have you spoken to the landlord to ask why the tow signage was put up without notifying you? Why is that the implication? I think youâ€™re stuck bud.  It's included in my rent. There is no separate fee for the space itself. Do you pay extra for the assigned space?
