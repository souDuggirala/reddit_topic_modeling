 I recently came across some people who were sharing tips about how to invade taxes. Some of these people own business and some have jobs. The one with the business always show loss so they don't end up owing much in taxes and some with jobs claim many dependent even though they don't live together or have any of the expenses of these "dependents" on them. They have big families and they claim each others to avoid paying taxes. Is this legal? if not what can be done about it? []() This is assuming that you're/they're somewhere in the USA.
