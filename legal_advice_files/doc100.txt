 In November of 2009, I bought my first home in Phoenix, Arizona, with help from the Your Way Home AZ program. The amount I received from them puts me in the range that the loan will be forgiven this November. I haven’t heard from anyone in the program for nearly the entire time (except when there was a lien put in the place because I had forgotten to pay the HOA fees early on, but that’s long since been resolved). Will the loan automatically be forgiven at the end of the ten years, or will I need to provide some sort of documentation to have it forgiven? Thanks in advance for the help! Definitely find your loan paperwork - it will identify the lender (probably a bank, not an NFP or the government) and have a provision on forgiveness. You can also reach out to the Arizona Department of Housing, who should have information on this program for participants from when it was active. Also step 1, read your paperwork. Then reach out to whatever agency the program was part of. I’ve reached out to the non-profit that helped facilitate the process, but the program has been shut down for many years now.

I’ve reached out to the non-profit that facilitated the loan, but the actual program has shut down. Just call them and ask. Your first step is to contact the agency and ask them. Depends on how the down payment assistance was structured - if it was as a loan, it does need to be forgiven; but if it was as a lien on your home, it might automatically expire at the end of its life (depends how it is written). You should contact the agency or entity that gave you the down payment assistance and ask them and review your paperwork from when you received it.
