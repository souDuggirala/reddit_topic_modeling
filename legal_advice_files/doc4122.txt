 Im Canadian, I work for an American company based in houston, but I work for the Canadian district. I work in mainly work in Canada but I do a lot of work in Alaska as well. I have a L1B Visa and I never come close to the 180 days in the US. Our company has told us we now need social security numbers to file taxes in America. One colleague has already received his SSN and the firm that our company hired to help us with the taxes told him he owes the US $10,000. I get paid in Canadian dollars by the Canadian district and I'm taxed by Canada. I dont understand how they can tax me twice on the same ammount.  It sounds like you need a tax accountant. There are a million tax laws and a million and one holes in them. Paying for a good tax accountant will save you in headaches and money. I've been working in the US since 2015 and have never once received a US equivalent T4 slip. So I should have been taxed on only let's say half of what Canada taxed me on? If I made 120,000 a year 60,000 should be taxed in canada and 60,000 taxed in the US? Would that mean I was over taxed in canada? And could go and get that money back? Because that would drop me into a lower tax bracket for those years... My head hurts .. I believe that canadian residents can deduct tax on foreeign income. You also need to ensurw that your T4 only reflects income from work in canada and that income earned in the US should be on a different tax form from the us. And go see a tax lawyer, if you can. Yes. You did work in the US, and are subject to FACTA. You have to pay US connected income, even if you aren't in the US 183 days/year.
