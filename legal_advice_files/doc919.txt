 A couple days ago, I went to my car (parked along the street in front of my house) to go to work, when I noticed it was not parked as straight as it was when I parked it the night before. Looked on the other side and there's a big dent on the door, and a piece of a hubcap cracked. No note left at all for me. My roommate told me that it might have been the neighbors across the street from me, because the same thing happened to his sister's car over the summer and it was one of the neighbors trucks backing out that bumped into it. There's no streetlights or anything here, so I highly doubt there'd be video footage of what happened. Should I go ask my neighbors if they did it, or is there anything I should do before that? Sorry if this is a dumb question, but if I should ask my neighbors, am I legally allowed to have my phone in my pocket recording audio without them knowing, so I have audio proof that they did it? If they admit that they did it, what legal action should I take? This is in Oklahoma.  You should file a claim with your insurance. In cases like this, you'll need some evidence or proof (not just suspicion) that it was your neighbors truck. The easiest way to do this is to see if there is any matching damage on their vehicle. Look to see if the heights match up. Was there any paint transfer. Stuff like that. Make sure you take pictures of everything that you can. There's no such thing as too many photos. Hopefully you'll be able to find enough evidence to show that it was your neighbor. I wouldn't expect your insurance agency to send out an investigative team, so you'll probably have to do most of the foot work if you want to see results. Last thing, I would actually avoid speaking with your neighbor unless you know them really well and know them to be stand up individuals. They may try to hide the damages on their vehicle when they find out that you suspect it was them. If you are going to talk to them, gather your evidence first.
