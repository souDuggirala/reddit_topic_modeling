 I bought a motorcycle without a title yesterday from Jay. Jay bought it from Steve with out a title. Steve is the registered owner in the dmv system. I went to the dmv and they gave me a application for duplicate title that steve has to fill out with his DL # address etcetc. I got in contact with steve and during the call he was cooperative and kind. After the dmv gave me the form I called him and he is absolutely refusing to sign it over for whatever reason. I have a bill of sale from steve to jay, and from jay to me. What are my options? I bought it in LA from jay thats also where the po lives. Im in palm desert. Sue Jay to undo the sale of the bike. Steve is under no obligation to you. Without a valid title, the sale to you, from Jay, was invalid. You can return the bike to Jay and demand your money back, or make him go get the title from Steve, because he can sue Steve. If you have both bills of sale proving the history of the bike, and Steve is refusing to sign the duplicate title paperwork, your only practical option (if you want to keep the bike) is to apply for a bonded title. It's a bit of a hassle and there's an extra cost, but it will allow you to register drive it. The title bond lasts 3 years after which you can apply to have the bond removed and a clean title issued.
