 Hello, I am wondering what possible actions may be taken after a guilty plea if the charges presented to a jury were changed several times (5 or more) during an active trial. Changed multiple times both during the evidence hearing and during the time in which the jury are deliberating their plea. Specifically changing the wording of the charges presented to a jury to reflect Burglary (b) when Burglary (a) has been widely accepted as false by defense and prosecution. What potential action could be taken pre or post sentencing If the defense believes these changes may have influenced the jury's plea. thank you. r/LegalAdviceUK might have a better idea.
