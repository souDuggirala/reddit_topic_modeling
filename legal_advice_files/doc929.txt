 I am now over 2,000 dollars behind on my Child support because of my deductions on my check being change starting 01/2017. I do not know why but as of 01/2017 my child support deductions were lowered by $90 monthly. The deduction was set up to come out of my employers check directly by a court order, I am currently waiting on a call back from the Alaska child support division. I am just looking for direction on where to go from here while I'm waiting on a call back from the CSD in Alaska? Has this happened to anyone else?
