 I have been arrested, went to my arraignment today. Was released on my own recognizance. Preliminary hearing is next week. Do I have to inform my employer? Non-violent crime. Other than missing work for hearing, what are my obligations to my employer. I don't want to risk termination if there is a chance this can get thrown out. You don't have to tell your employer. You do have to get time off work to attend the hearing however if you don't want to get fired for that. You have no obligation to tell anybody.
