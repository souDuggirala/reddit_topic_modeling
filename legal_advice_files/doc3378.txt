 I've been separated for 18 months, divorce keeps getting delayed. We do not live together, and have two children, 7M, 9F. My soon to be ex keeps making claims (via email, cc'ing his lawyer) that the children are telling him they're afraid of me, that I shower with them, that I walk around the house in my underwear. I don't. Right now we have 60/40, but he's trying to get 50/50, I believe mostly so he doesn't have to pay child support, he's never taken much of an interest in the kids, who were both unplanned, the first is the reason we got married - his foreign parents insisted on it. I've been their primary caregiver all their lives - before the separation, he was rarely around - traveling for work or out doing other things. I've always had a great relationship with them, but now I fear he's planting ideas in their heads, getting them to say what he wants with bribes like iPhones and other items. I have a lawyer, but he's not been super helpful and I do not have the money to switch. He's always been a liar, and I'm concerned he's turning my kids into liars as well. These accusations are not true, how do I fight them?  Tell your lawyer that you need a parental alienation clause in your divorce decree and you intend to enforce it. Prior to the finalization of the decree, have your lawyer send a cease and desist letter to your ex and document incidents as they occur.
