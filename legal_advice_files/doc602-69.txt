My wife professionally goes by her maiden name which is two very common names (think "Jane Smith" or something similar). My wife is in academia and her work phone, email and office location are easily findable if you Google her name.

My wife started getting weird emails from strangers, which started out rather innocently but now are usually sexually suggestive. She also has gotten some strange sexually suggestive voicemails. At first she thought disgruntled students were playing a prank on her  and actually notified campus police but after we did some investigating we found that there is a woman selling pornographic clips of herself using my wife's name as an alias (we assume it's an alias). Now seems like these emails/voicemails are coming from people attempting to reach this woman.

My wife doesn't want to change her name, change her contact info, or delist her contact information (colleagues from other institutions may need to get in touch with her this way). We've attempted to reach out to this woman on Twitter pleading her to change her name and there's no response.

Would it be worth it to discuss with an attorney? I imagine we'd have to subpoena Twitter/the video sale site she uses and then send her a C&amp;D once we have her real name and address. The whole process seems like it'd be long and expensive which is why we're asking if it's even possible for us to force this woman to change her name. *Your post has been removed for the following reason(s):*

*Do not reach out to a moderator personally, and do not reply to this message as a comment.* just a couple of commercials, no stage acting like my "imposter"; but that's exactly why it raised a flag.  i got a random email from a casting director thinking they were me.  if i ever want to make a real effort and quit my day job, this could cause complications if i don't rectify it now.  

as another user commented, i'm going to find out if they registered their stage name yet and if not, i'll get the jump on them.  i already have the url and all the social media accounts, so i'm working on it.   you can save comments and posts. you dont have to comment some nonsense or a period to get to the post later. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] I don't know the people that you know in academia, but that's definitely not my experience. Yes, early in the career if you barely have any quality publications it's still an option, but it's definitely not something you want to do further down their career as OP's wife seems to be. [removed] [removed] [removed] Basically that's kind of what happens.
Yes, nowadays there's ORCID, but most people still search by name. 

My professor changed his name after marriage and his earlier work is basically non-existent for the average person looking him up. It's definitely something you want to avoid further down your career. [removed] I'm published in a paper and my last name is misspelled. I get called out on it every time I put it on a job application. It's a big deal.

That's her problem.

Start adding her middle initial to all official documents so people can tell them apart. So now you have two names attached to your published work. Give me a use case where this would be an issue.

People change their names all the time in academia, it's really not a problem. It may be easier and more effective to add *more* identifying information to her public information and contact options.  

For example, on academic websites you may be able to add a photograph, her work history (resume info), her age (which could be really useful if there is a disparity - e.g., the porn star is 18 and your wife is 30-something), or links to public professional profiles like LinkedIn.  

These guys will naturally want to check out her "information" and if the websites have her photo it will quickly help them move onto the next result.  Seeing her resume should also make it clear that your wife is the wrong person.

Depending on the level of control you have over online listings, you may want to add a link from her page that says something like "Other people with the same name" and link to a people finding website that has the porn start as a top result. [removed] You have the option to just use her legal name? Well there's your cheap and easy solution. [removed] [removed] [removed] &gt;which is your whole bread basket if you're an academic
