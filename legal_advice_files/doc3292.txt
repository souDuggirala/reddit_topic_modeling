 Hi My friend married a non US citizen, (she never filed the i-485 or Anything else)he turned abusive, physically and verbally. He’s back in his home country, and thinks they’re going to try to work things out. She wants a divorce, he has threatened to file for VAWA if she divorces him. He overstayed his esta visa for under 180 days. She’s scared if she divorces him he’s going to come back and be crazy. She has months evidence of his abuse. They don’t own anything together/no kids. And she’s just worried what he will do when she files and serves him. Should she do anything before she files for divorce aside from police reports of the abuse? Not a lawyer but: If he overstayed his VISA and didn't file for the I-485, he probably won't be able to enter the country. There's a penalty for that. It can be 5 to 10 years, I think. In some states, you can divorce without the other significant other present and request and annulment. Maybe she should talk with a lawyer and file a police report with all the evidence. When he tries to re-enter the country, this police report will pop out and I doubt he would be able to leave the airport.
