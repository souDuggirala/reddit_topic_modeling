 I rent a 1000 square foot garage in Bloomington, Indiana. The price is great and I like the location, but I don't think the heat is working in my unit. I turn on the thermostat and nothing happens. I also switched the breaker on and off. I thought that maybe it was working but that there was too much cold air coming in, but when I got my gas bill, I saw that it was at the base rate. With that being said, there are a couple of other factors. When I signed the 1 year lease in August, the owner told me that I could request to move out at any time, and that I would only have to pay the rent until he found somebody else to replace me. I put in the request 3 weeks ago BEFORE letting him know that I can't get the heat to work. I don't want him to think or argue that I would use the heat issue as an excuse to get out of the lease, but honestly, that would be a motivation. 2) It isn't miserable in the unit. I can survive with a space heater. So to sum up, I already intend on leaving the unit once the owner finds another renter, but do I have recourse for breaking the lease because of the heat issues? Also, what if the heat actually does work but I'm missing something? It has been 10 days since I submitted a maintenance request, but I haven't heard back from him. I think you could get out of the lease if he doesnt fix the heat, and he may actually be legally obligated to fix it in a timely manner. I know for residential rental properties the landlord is required to provide a functional source of water and a functional source of heat, i cant see why a commercial rental would be any different, unless you were renting a vacant lot, which you arnt. If the city/county found out there wasnt a functional source of heat in the building it may actually be policy to condemn the property till it has functioning heat.
