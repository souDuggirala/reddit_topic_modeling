 Me and my car were caught in the big snow storm we had in Illinois last Sunday. My car went to the ditch and I ended being rescued by a trooper. He put some red tape on the car and tell me that it was going to be tow and they will call me when I will be able to pick it up again. I just received a call from the towing company telling me that I have to pay $400 because the police make them tow the car at midnight (4 days after the storm) and I have to pay fees because the car was in the ditch for 4 days. WHAT?? I call the state police but they told me that the trooper dealing with the towing is not available until Monday. It is legal to make me pay extra fees for midnight towing and having my car in the ditch for 3 days? Specially when I didn't ask for that service. Remember, is a private company making me pay this not the State or the County. How can I, legally, avoid to pay extra fees and just pay for the regular towing? Thanks! Every location can be different. Some places put a sticker for a ticket/notification. After x days, it might be towed.  but why the police wait 3 days and tow it on the 4th day at midnight? why? that makes me pay an extra $200 just because the tow it afterhours Probably got a fine for leaving your car on the side of the highway,  Get the police report/request. Police can call a tow truck and order a tow if deemed necessary. Yes, you will still be charged. You can try calling the towing company and explaining the situation, but I actually don't understand how it's special and means you shouldn't have to pay that amount.
