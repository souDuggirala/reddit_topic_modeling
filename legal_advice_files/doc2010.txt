 I sent some videos to a news station, and they used it, but I'm afraid that I may have unintentionally gave away consent for their use, when I was really looking to sell them. Here's the relevant bits of the conversation: ME: "If you're interested in licensing rights, I'll upload the video somewhere and send it." NEWS: "Thanks! Let me know as soon as you upload the video." ME: \[links to videos\] NEWS: "Thanks! Really appreciate you sharing these clips with us." I had no intention of letting them use it for free. I had figured they weren't interested when they said "appreciate you sharing" as if they were saying something like "these are cute, but we don't need them." Would I have no grounds to ask for compensation for the video they used now after the fact?  No, you still own the copyright on the video even if you post it to YouTube. I'm seeing a lot of votes. Can someone tell me what's going on? For example, if I posted a youtube video, they don't get access to it just because it's on youtube. Or do they?  Yes. I first sent them some stills of the video and a GIF, and then asked the above. I guess my logic was that on Youtube or Twitter, when videos are posted, and there are often comments under saying something along the lines of "Hello, I'm from xxx News, could we use your video?" etc. Was I supposed to say "interested in buying licensing?" Just to be clear, you willingly gave them the videos before negotiating any kind of licensing agreement?
