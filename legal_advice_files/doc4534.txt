 I was arrested in Texas around April and charged with a state jail felony. I don’t have money for a lawyer but have been saving and don’t live in the county where the arrest happened. At what point should I request to be admitted into the program, it’s been 7 months from the arrest and haven’t heard anything from the court. I’m assuming they’re going to indict me and then notify me of arraignment. I spoke to an assistant DA about 3 months after my arrest and he said he knew about the arrest but the office hadn’t received my case yet. [removed]
