 Excuse my French. My boyfriend paid for a septum piercing and the piercer did it in the complete wrong place. Septum piercings are supposed to be done in a sweet spot where there is no cartilage and the pierced shoved it straight through the cartilage. We went back and they said they “don’t do refunds”. How can they do this when they completely fucked up his piercing?  I wasn’t there so I can’t say  Did he read it before he signed it? They said “it’s in the form you signed” but didn’t show us the form Usually before the piercing they’ll have you sign a form/waver saying that you understand it isn’t their fault if a piercing rejects/infects. I don’t know if it accounts for them messing it up. If you signed a form, check it to see if it says anything about the piercer fucking up.
