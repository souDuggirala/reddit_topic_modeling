 I was caught, stupidly, stealing art supplies and stopped by loss prevention . All the merchandise was returned and I was compliant (after initially trying to walk away from the scene). It was 18 dollars over the theft 3 (100$)so it's now theft 2. I was arrested, processed and dismissed for a court date. My record is clean and this will be a first offense. Does anyone know/have advice on how this will go? I understand I could get probation/community service/fines but biggest worry is jail time. I understand having a lawyer helps negotiate and can often talk to the stores. Should I get one no matter what? I just really don't want jail time and risk what I have (work, apt, pet). But having this be my first offense will likely be probation and fines right?? [removed]
