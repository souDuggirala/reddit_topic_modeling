 We recently purchased a home, and came across some complications. Some problematic family members of the trustee selling the house came across the key for the house. Theyve now made it their "home", theyve changed the locks, refused to leave, and when we first went to see the house (it was completely vacant) all of the windows were broken. Two months had passed, the windows and floors were fixed, and then these squatters come in. We're listening to the realtors advice on how to get them out, but what defense do we have if they come back, or even vandalize while theyre in there? But you didnâ€™t close on the purchase yet? Or did you? Since we went to see the house, and started the process. All damages were fixed, and the those people got in Not sure I understand the situation. Have you closed on your purchase, or not? Is there a bank involved? Two months passed between when and when? I funny really understand the question. If you own the home, legally and fully, and sometime is damaging your property, you call the police. You may also have grounds for a civil suit. Obviously you need to know who they are in order to sue them, hence why you call the police These guys are a whole group, with about 5 vehicles in the driveway, if they refuse to give us all their information?  That very much depends on details that you need to discuss with your realtor and your attorney. But once you legal own it and have a clean title, you should call the police if someone breaks in or vandalizes it As soon as the house becomes ours? No court proceedings? You call the police and/or sue them for damages
