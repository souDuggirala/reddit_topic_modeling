I hope I am using this subreddit correctly. My grandmother just had a knee-revision surgery. She requested the defective device (implant) from the hospital that removed it to use as evidence so she can attempt to get compensation from the doctors who performed the original surgery.

The hospital that is sending the device mailed her an agreement. Before she signs it, I wanted to read over it, but I don’t fully understand what this paragraph implies:

“This Agreement involves unique matters for which no monetary remedy is adequate. The parties agree that this Agreement is specifically enforceable by a court, including mandatory injunctive relief, both preliminary and permanent.”

Could someone please explain what it means? Thank you for your help! I will let her know what you said. The hospital doesn't want her to sue them or the doctor because they had no way of knowing that the device was defective.  If she signs it she can't sue them but gets the implant.  If she refuses to sign they won't send the implant.

Your grandmother shouldn't go after the surgeons that did the surgery, **she should go after the manufacturer** and having the defective implant will help.  The surgeons rely on the manufacturer to put the implant through quality assurance testing to make sure it is not defective. There have been several successful lawsuits brought against hip implant manufactures for failing to ensure their products weren't defective.
