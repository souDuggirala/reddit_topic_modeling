 I have had a cellphone number for the last three years that has been getting calls from debts collectors. The frequency of these calls were about once a week for the first year which dialed back to about 1 call every two weeks the second year. Now it is down to about once every two months. I asked the last collector how long the debt had been active, and the debt had been recently bought meaning that the former owner of the phone is still handing out the phone number for numerous medical bills. Using my phone number on a Best Buy loyalty card, I saw the individuals information flash on the screen as he had not updated his number from mine. Finally, after three years I have obtained his information. Here is my question. As this man is handing out my number for medical bills for procedures that had happened within the last year- what are my options for legal recourse? He is obviously scamming the system, and a simple letter to his house asking him to knock it the hell off seems less than a slap on the wrist. I debated on just giving the debt collectors his current information, but that also seems light as he has gotten off the hook for three years. TLDR; Former owner of my phone number has been handing out my number for the last three years and I have been dealing with his debt collection calls. What are my legal options. “The debt has recently been bought” does NOT mean he’s still handing out the number to scam the system. It means one debt collection company got fed up trying to collect on it and sold it to a second debt collection company. Could be years old debt.  Debt collectors are fairly easy to shake. Just send them written notice that they are no longer allowed to call this phone number. Keep record of the date the notice was sent. If they get bold enough to call you, file an FDCPA complaint, and your phone should be silent from them on out.
