If someone punches me in the face, I demand that they do the “I’m a little piggy here’s my snout, oink oink oink, oink oink oink.” From South Park while I record it, or else I say to file a police report and threaten legal action. 

Is this extortion? I don’t gain anything, but I still threaten a lawsuit unless a specific action is taken, of which the opposing party does not want to do.
