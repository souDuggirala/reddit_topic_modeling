 I began working for my university at the beginning of the semester and in the contract I signed it stated I would be paid 11.40 an hour. Months have since gone by and I got notified earlier this week that apparently the contract was a mistake and I was meant to be paid 11.00 an hour, not 11.40. Furthermore, I’m being asked to compensate the school for the .40 extra I’ve been getting every hour. I did the calculations and I would have to pay back around 200 dollars. At the moment the dean of my college is arguing with administration for me to stay at 11.40 and not have to pay the university back. If she loses the argument, will I really be obligated to return the money.  If you end up having to pay it back, I suggest asking for it to come out of future paychecks - and pay really close attention. Also, check if your school has student legal services, though if they do they may not help with cases involving the school itself.  Do you fall into the student employee union at California State? If so, and your pay is defined in the bargaining agreement, they could argue that this was a clerical error and hold you to the amount listed there If you were actually overpaid, you would need to repay that amount unfortunately If it was in the contract, you are in the right and they can't force you to pay it back. However, chances are they won't keep you employed if you don't so there's a trade-off there (keeping in mind of course that they are not required to keep you if you do pay of course).
