 I had an expensive package arrive today that would require a signature. The package was signed for by "me" while I was at work. Is this something worth pursuing?  I do think you should at least speak with the delivery company. Especially during the holiday season, delivery drivers are crazy busy, and loathe to put in the effort normally needed (ie, leaving a note on your door telling you to come to their location and sign for your package). If it had been gone when you got home, there would have been a huge issue with them, because their records would show it in “delivered/signed for”. It’s not right.  IANAL but I did just start a job with FedEx. This is a huge issue mentioned in the initial training for driver positions. Drivers are penalized for "failed deliveries", including deliveries requiring signature where the recipient is not present. This motivates drivers to forge the signature and leave the package anyway under the threat of payment penalty or even termination if the percentage of returns is high or recurring. If you report that the signature is forged (Bear in mind I just started and don't know how this is followed through with) I have been told that the driver is terminated under a zero tolerance policy for mail security. Not exactly legal advice, I know, but I'd suggest weighing the risk to your order and the potential to cost someone their job due to bad business conditions. but it didn't...... Because if my package went missing i would have been screwed not if you got your package why kick up a fuss for the sake of it
