 If a medical facility gets a search warrant from a general attorney to obtain all medical records for patient information and surgery charts for building a case against insurance fraud and a technician that worked there for only about 6 months was told when she first started (no medical background) by the doctor who owns the practice that if visions didn’t met the criterial for insurance to cover that you are to change them so that they did. This technician later finds out that this is illegal and that this is the exact situation the attorney general is trying to take down this owner for. Well the technicians name is on these documents with the changed visions and there has been multiple messages to this technician telling them to change visions in which they did. Fast forward to the attorney general stopping at this particular technicians house grilling them about protocol regarding visions and this technician got nervous and lied for the doctor. Can the technician go to jail if they truly didn’t know what they were doing was illegal and they were forced by the doctor to do it?   That's a subpoena, not a search warrant. It depends. If a technician signed off on false statements, it could be considered fraud, as well as be grounds for revoking a license. A prosecutor may choose to grant immunity to the technician to testify against the doctor (who would be the one they'd try to claw back funds from). The technician should absolutely report the doctor ASAP and get a lawyer.
