 We've had some trouble trying to sell our semi-permanent van, which has been on the market for nearly 2 months. In this time we've had multiple people come to check it out and say that they like it, but they've nearly all fallen through. So we had absolutely no idea what was going on, until recently when we got this message from last buyer "Hi, basically the managers said that semi permanents have no lease". This is factually incorrect, as all tenants must recieve at least a one year lease, and so it's no wonder we're having so much trouble. r/AusLegal
