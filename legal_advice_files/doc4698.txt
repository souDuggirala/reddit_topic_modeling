 Hey guys so this is a bit of a new one so bare with me as I’m new to the sub and Reddit as a whole. Keep in mind I live in Vancouver. So I was with this girl for 10 months (living separately) and recently broke up with her for how she started to treat me (im 22 she is 20). Anyways we had a trip booked coming up to Mexico December 10th to 18th this year which I paid her mother for last month when she booked the trip. It was 1900 for my portion of the trip. I paid via E-transfer with my bank which is CIBC. I’m going to ask her mother for the money back but she is very stubborn and controlling and even more so now that we broke up. Do I have any legal recourse in this situation if she refuses to pay me back as I am not attending the trip now? My name is on the ticket for the flight and hotel room we had. I appreciate any feedback thanks guys!
