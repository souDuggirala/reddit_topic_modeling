 Hypothetically speaking; Let's say you and your buddies go to a club one night and it is an 18 and above only club. You spot a fine girl, hit her up, and she agrees to go home with you. This girl is underage, but let's make 2 scenarios out of this. a) You are aware that she is underage, and use omission, knowing that it's an 18 and above only club, as a reason to sleep with this underage girl. b) You are not aware of her age and proceed with the sex. The ends of a and b meets, however, how would it play out in court?  Hypotheticals go in r/legaladviceofftopic
