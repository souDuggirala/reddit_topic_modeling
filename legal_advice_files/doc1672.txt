 Hi all, I'm based in Australia and ordered an item from a German Music Magazine Website (under 20 euros) The payment option was for an invoice to be sent out once the item was received However, I did not receive the item but I did continue to receive letters from the company stating I owe them money. The letter states legal ramifications will occur if payment is not received. I have emailed the company but have not heard back I am enquiring here to see if there is any way they can internationally follow through with this? What are my rights? Thank you for your help  This forum primarily deals with US and Canadian law. I recommend posting this on r/auslegal too.
