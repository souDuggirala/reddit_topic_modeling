 I work hourly at a national retail store. Earlier in December, we were all told we will be receiving wage increases (company wide) as of 2019. At this point, I was told my new wage would be $15.75 (a pretty significant increase from before). After returning from my holiday, my manager informed me there was a company-wide mistake, and all employees in my position will actually be making $14.25. This is an increase of less than a dollar from what I currently make. All other employees will be receiving increases of $2-$3. My position is mid-level, with many managerial permissions and oversights. Would also like to add, I've had very positive reviews for the past two years, along with minor pay increases, and most recently a promotion based on positive performance. Is there anything I can do to try and get the $15.75 wage? you can ask or try to find another job which pays that its only illegal to pay you less for hours that you have already worked at a certain wage  $15.75 wage? Ask nicely. If you are in the US, so long as you are told before you work what you will be paid your employer can change your pay whenever they want. What state do you live in?
