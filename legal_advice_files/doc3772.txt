 I live in UK and my mum in Pakistan and she was recently diagnosed with cancer. Over there, there is no good healthcare and treatment over there is extremely untrustworthy. She is also alone over there. If I get her over here, is there any way to get her treated over here? I am a taxpayer and feel that my mum should be entitled as my immediate family. Thanks for the help Your local CAB office will be able to advise you.  To receive free treatment on the NHS you must be a legal resident of the UK for at least 6 months. Visits to A E are free for everyone however. Thanks /r/legaladviceUK is more likely to be able to help you out.
