So I’m sure there is always a plentiful amount of people making these posts but figured I’d ask to be a bit more specific for my situation. I dated a girl for 5 months and ended it because she was cheating on me. Today she posted on her Twitter a video of me and my dog laying in bed and said this is /u/senorcappuccino and he neglects his dog. He only pretends he likes her for the instagram. Fuck this piece of shit.

This is cause for concern because I will soon be entering the application pool to become a police officer and a background investigator is surely going to find this and think about it. I feel like if I can’t get her to take it down then it’ll be an issue for my future. I did reach out to her to ask to take it down but kept it professional in case I was able to do something about it. I said “you should probably just move on with your life and be mature. I figure I’d be nice and just ask you once respectfully to delete your tweet.” Exactly word for word like that.

Any guidance is definitely appreciated thanks! [deleted]
