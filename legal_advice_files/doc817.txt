 I started to get notifications from social media apps asking for a password change, so i started freaking out assuming i was being hacked, apparently i left my email open on our work computer and my co-worker, (who is not my friend) decided to lock me out of all my accounts and send snapchats to all of my friends lists including family and random people and girls i do not know that well asking to have sexual intercourse, meanwhile i'm trying my very best to get my account info back but he has my email so he was changing the passwords right away. My other co-worker who witnessed him do this called me and told me all that was happening. What Legal actions can i take for this, my family is in shock of the messages he sent them, and there was also racist pictures on my snapchat story which i have proof of. One last thing to mention is that he deleted all the password changed emails so there was no evidence, i only have one. Please help me this is completely innapropriate, and i have 100 girls now calling me a pervert, is this defamation of character?
