 I'm from a country where there's many restrictions to pretty much simple things (middle east) so I'm wondering how it's like in Ontario, Canada. (PS. also what about the U.S? curious) Just curious because I document a lot of stuff on my social media, and flying is a unique experience I like to document especially. The other day in my hometown (middle east) I almost got into a problem with some guy for filming a hotel as a luxurious experience.. but it was alright at the end. So anyway, I know you're not supposed to be filming or talking on your phone AT the passport control section (or wearing a hat, etc.), but what about the rest of the places? like when you walk out of the plane into the airport, towards (not AT) the security/passport control? The thing is I don't film discreetly, I kinda have my arm extended out at times to take a video selfie so people sometimes mistake it for me shoving my phone in their face to take a photo of them (but I'm not in reality). This really seems more hypothetical and better suited for /r/legaladviceofftopic.
