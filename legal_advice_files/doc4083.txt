 I’ve got a friend who rented a piece of equipment through Home Depot. The employee used her information to contact her on her personal number and find her on social media. The only message I saw to her Facebook was along the lines of “put that big ass on my face”...can only imagine the other ones. She hasn’t responded on any platform and blocked his number on her phone. On his public FB timeline there’s another girl who commented pictures of messages he sent her. He’s definitely done this TONS of times and doesn’t give a shit. It seems like it’s his real, personal FB account since he seems to have family added. I’ve told her to report it to his higher ups already and I think she will, but is there anything that can be done besides that? Is using personal information like that from your place of work illegal? Thanks! She can make a police report (depending on where she is located, this may have various degrees of success) and try to get a civil harassment restraining order, if she wishes to do so.  He’s contacted her multiple times through multiple texts and messages on her phone, Instagram, and Facebook. Does that change things?  Probably not illegal if he only contacted her once. Going through the store is the best bet.
