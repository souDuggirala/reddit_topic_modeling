 Basically what it says. We were given a piece of land to share and we both have to sign a document so it is in our names. My brother and I aren't on good terms, never have been, and I've already had the attorney write this up and he has now said "Just take it. I don't want anything to do with this." So I'll have to get it redone in just my name, which is fine, but how do we just take his name off? I've asked him to sign something in writing so I can get it done and he said he's not signing anything for me ever and to not contact him again. So now what? I AM GOING TO CONSULT MY ATTORNEY but she's not available until Wednesday so I'm just hoping for peace of mind. TL; DR Brother and I were left a piece of land to share and now he just wants me to take it but he doesn't want to physically sign the paper gifting it to me. Now what? Encourage him with a small amount of money if you have too.  As an incentive, send him the property tax bill prorated with his share (and in HIS name). Ask him again to go to the town clerk and sign a quit claim.  Get him to sign a Quit Claim Deed, Notarized, file it with the county property office. No other way.
