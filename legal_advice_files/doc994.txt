 I work for a small company that does sub contract work for cities around Oregon. My problem is I have never had a set schedule. I was originally hired more than 90 days ago, to be a full time employee, and I've never had more than a day's notice of when I work or where I'll be going. We normally meet at our yard and then take company vehicles to job sites. My question is, is there any labor laws that are being violated by doing this? It's always just been annoying and I've been looking for better employment, but I just got notified that I have to be to work in exactly 7 hours. This is abnormal but it is very common that I only have 10 hours heads up of what I'm doing the next day. Also, I regularly will not receive texts or messages letting me know what I'm doing the next day, which means I don't work. I'm just looking for advice in terms of whether any of this is "illegal" in some way, or if there's a way I can get them to stop handling scheduling this way legally. They do it to all of their employees, about 16 people. Thanks in advance
