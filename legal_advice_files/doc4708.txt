 Alright, so my mother offered a step-relative (Canadian citizen) to live in the house (in Florida) for a few months to study for an exam, presumably. I also live in the house and participate in online teams, always trying to keep volume to a minimum. Communication within the team is necessary in order to succeed. Apparently instead of telling me to lower the volume or move to a different room he claimed he throttled the wifi, which caused it to lose connection for approximately 10 minutes. He boasted about this during dinner. I believe he is capable of doing this since he have taken computer coding classes at a university. What crime, if any, was committed by this action? I am not looking for an indictment or any sort of punishment but just to inform him of potential consequences if he choose to do this again. You can limit his bandwith in router settings.  Just communicate to him how you just did to us. Be cool about it. “Hey man, I’ve noticed since you’ve been here the WiFi has been spotty. I play (insert community game) and it really blows when it drops connection. I know you have a computer background, is there anything you can do to fix it?” Not legal advice, but have you tried just explaining that it's really important to you and in the future you'd be happy to accommodate some other way?
