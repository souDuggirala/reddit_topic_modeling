 I'll keep this short. Apartment's (rented) roof started leaking water everywhere. One of the rather expensive paintings fell and broke on of the dining table chairs...during breakfast hour ( I could've been sitting there eating cereal) . Water leaked down onto the Main Electrical Panel. Caus of the leak: One of the peeps who work for the front office left water on somewhere in the apartment above mine. Do I have something here?  Yep. Document the damages and any evidence of the party responsible RIGHT NOW if you haven't already, dig up the most recent photos/etc of the pre-damage condition of anything damaged. If you have renter's insurance, start there. If not, contact the front office and let them know what happened and that you would like what was damaged repaired to its pre-damaged condition/replaced with a like item. If they refuse, consider whether or not you'd like to take them to small claims over it. Edit: My sentence structure was a bit confusing, clarified. Contact your renters insurance and let them handle it.
