 "In the event that either Party breaches a material provision under this Agreement, the non-defaulting Party may terminate this Agreement immediately and require the defaulting Party to indemnify the non-defaulting Party against all reasonable damages." Columbus, Ohio. For a community outreach coordinator for a nonprofit organization. What does this mean? My dad helped me interpret it as "if I do something to damage their reputation and cost them a million dollars, then i would have to pay them a million dollars". Is this the case? What does it mean? Should I sign this?  Yes it’s pretty normal. It’s just letting you know there are consequences for violating the contract.  "if I do something to damage their reputation and cost them a million dollars, then i would have to pay them a million dollars". Is this the case? Yes. This is nothing but a statement of what can happen in a breach of contract anyway. It changes nothing. Is this a normal thing in a contract? I don’t want to be fiscally responsible for a mistake  It means that if you fuck up, your contract is over and you owe them, but if they fuck up, your contract is over and they owe you.
