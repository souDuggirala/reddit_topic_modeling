 My girlfriends boss, the manager of a fast food chain has instructed my gf to clean the bathroom stalls which include biohazard materials such as blood and feces. The first time she cleaned it off the walls when someone had explosive diarrhea, with a basic set of thin plastic gloves and told her manager she wouldn't be cleaning feces again. For the second time now when cleaning she has come across a stall with feces all over it. She made her management aware and he instructed her to clean it. After explaining to him that she wouldn't be cleaning because his lack of proper equipment, he got someone else to do it. Can she be forced to clean biohazard bodily fluids like feces and blood when she isn't provided proper safety equipment? NAL. In general, no. Biohazard cleanup requires special gear and training, and it is illegal for an employer to make you clean it without both. Your gf should file a complaint with OSHA and/or the labor board, as you can get seriously ill from improper biohazard cleanup. If it's not her, it will be someone else.
