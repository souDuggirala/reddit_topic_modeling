 I traded in my car to purchase a used Tesla on 12/31/2018. I thought it was a little weird that they haven't taken any money out from my bank loan yet and today (01/02/2019) I got an email from the Tesla "funding specialist -direct lending" stating "I was looking through your paperwork to try and get your loan finalized, I noticed we don't have a signed MVPA form from you on file. I have attached the docs if you could please sign and return to me at this email address would be greatly appreciated!" The document he sent me is only two sentences long and very generic. It reads as follows: "This agreement is entered into and effective as of the date you accept this Agreement and complete your Order Payment, by electronic means or otherwise. By confirming and accepting this Agreement, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement." That is all that is written and then it has the signature of the senior director of north America sales dated on 12/31/2018 as well as a blank spot for me to sign. The rest of the page is blank except for the giant red Tesla logo at the top. I emailed the guy back asking for the full MVPA because I wanted to read what I was signing for and he sent me someone else's MVPA for a model 3 (I got a model S) with all of their personal information filled out except for the signature. They already accepted my trade in and gave me possession of the car on 12/31/2018. The really weird thing is that on my Tesla profile, my balance due shows $0.00 and right next to make a payment it says "Your model S is fully paid". I checked my bank account and no money has been withdrawn from my loan... From what I have gathered, the MVPA should have been signed before they gave me the car. What happens if I don't sign the MVPA? Can I legally keep the car?  I received more information and wanted to make it easier to read instead of having a bunch of edits. How should I handle this in the future? Why did you repost this?
