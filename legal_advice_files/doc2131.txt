 VA. Long story short, I need my 2016 tax return for financial aid. I've tried contacting my previous employer for it and haven't gotten a response. It's been months. I cant get it from the IRS because I never filed so they won't have it. I tried to call Intuit Payroll but can't get past their automated service because I don't have or can get the business ID. All I have to go off is an old pay stub that just says Intuit on it in the bottom corner. I don't remember what I made in 2016 so I put down 13,000 on my financial aid form as a guess but since its over 12,000 it means I am required to file my tax return and now my financial aid is on hold until I file it. I have zero way to get my W2 and now will probably miss this semester of school. I can't call the IRS because the government is shut down and I literally have no idea what to do now. If I had guessed 12,000 I would be fine. I've called the financial aid department and have to go in on Monday to try and work this out but the main issue at hand is I cant get my 2016 W2. Any help please!?! I've called all their numbers and there is no email listed under their contact us page. I should be getting a W2 from them in the coming weeks since they were open for a little during 2018 and can get the FED ID off that whenever that comes, but I am on a time crunch now and waiting for that W2 to show up isn't going to help. So the payroll company has a single phone number and no other form of contact such as a email address or form on their website? Can you contact a former co-worker and ask for the ID off their W2?
