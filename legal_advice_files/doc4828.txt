 Hi guys, this happened a week-ish ago at work. I work in CA. I wasn't there when the incident happened, but it affects the entire staff. I work in a coffee shop, and because the management is mediocre on a good day, we often run out of milk or sugar. Usually when this happens, someone will run over the the grocery store and be reimbursed by the manager. Until about a week ago. We had run out of something important and it needed to be replaced ASAP. So, (as I've heard from people who were there) one of the cashier's asked for the register key to take some money out and put it towards the needed items. Our manager asked him why he would need it, and just told him to take it out of the tips. He did, but isn't this illegal? Should there be a next step? Is this big enough to blow the whistle over? My co-workers and I have talked about it extensively and all agree it's very unethical. Thanks for your time guys. Happy Thanksgiving. Ok, thanks for the response! I'll keep an eye on my manager and post back if anything else happens.  Note: a tip jar is generally not considered the same as tips given directly to someone. You need to specify in the post which happened... because the tip jar in most states im aware of can be distributed however the owner wants. Including them pocketing it entirely.  . Furthermore it is illegal for employers to make wage deductions from gratuities, or from using gratuities as direct or indirect credits against an employee's wages. The law further states that gratuities are the sole property of the employee or employees to whom they are given. "Gratuity" is defined in the Labor Code as a tip, gratuity, or money that has been paid or given to or left for an employee by a patron of a business over and above the actual amount due for services rendered or for goods, food, drink, articles sold or served to patrons. It also includes any amount paid directly by a patron to a dancer covered by IWC Wage Order 5or 10.
