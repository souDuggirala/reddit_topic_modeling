Hi everyone, I'm hoping this will be quick. It's mostly a sanity check. 

I'm a software consultant that works for a firm. I've finished my first assignment and now they are consulting me out to a different company. 

The problem is that this company is a benefits provider and my partner current has a legal case open against them for wrongful termination of benefits. I feel like this is a conflict of interest and I need to disclose this to my employer before they consult me out. 

Am I worried over nothing? It's super unlikely I'll be working with confidential data, but none the less I want to be sure.
