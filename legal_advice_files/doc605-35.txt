My mum is lonely after the death of my step-dad. She has come to the attention of a man who displays all the warning flags of a ne'er do well chancer which my mum is ignoring. I have Enduring Power of Attorney for financial and medical along with my brother. What steps can I take legally to make sure she is protected? Edited to add, she will resent us using it if we do, can she just cancel it?
