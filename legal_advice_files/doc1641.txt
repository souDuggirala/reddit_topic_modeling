 I was at work when we got the evacuation order to leave the rehab I work at in Agoura Hills, CA. I had to use the company car to transport the rehab clients out of the house and was forced to leave my car there. I only had liability insurance so my policy won’t cover. Is this something my job would be liable to pay for? Should I sue?  Yes, still haven’t heard back from my job about wether or not they’re going to pay for it or not.  Have you told them your claim was denied? Yeah, they told me to file a claim with my insurance however the claim was denied since I only have liability coverage. They said they’re filing a claim under their policy but that it isn’t guaranteed that they will cover. They should still be liable for the damages and other expenses I’ve had since the loss right? In case their insurance denies the claim as well.  Have you asked your employer for reimbursement for the value of your car before it was destroyed? Has someone contacted you from your job saying you have to pay for the car? Also, a work owned vehicle driven by a worker performing work related duties should be covered by the business’s insurance.
