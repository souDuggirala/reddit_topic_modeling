 So my company recently decided to start locking all the entrance doors for food safety and they want to issue key cards to all the employees to get in the building. But they want us to sign an agreement that if the cards are lost/damaged they can deduct money from our paychecks to replace it. Its only $5 but the cards can be demagnitized by a cellphone I guess. Can they legally force me to agree to that? I know Ohio is an at will employment state so they can fire me for any reason but Ohio revised code says (to my understanding) that they can make me agree. to a payroll deduction like that. So if I refuse and they fore me would that be a wrongfully termination that i could collect unemployment on or in the case of my union have a legal fight?
