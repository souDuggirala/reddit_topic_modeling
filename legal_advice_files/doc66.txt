 This one is pretty simple. I moved out of an appartment a few years ago and forgot to have the utilities changed out of my name. I was billed around $400 over the next coming months without my knowledge. I just moved into a new place, I went to go move the utilities for this place into my name and they informed me of the almost $400 I owe. I got all the relevant information from the agency I rented from back then ( The lease and the notice of termination for the lease) as proof that i didn't live there, but Avista informed me that regardless of that I am responsible for the money. They told me i night want to contact the leasing office and see if they would be able to cover it for me. I'm from Washington State, btw. Thanks for any info!
