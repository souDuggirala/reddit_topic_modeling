 I work at a nonprofit (with more than 11 employees) fulltime in Massachusetts. I put my two weeks in about a week ago, unexpectedly i got a reminder call about a routine medical appointment i had scheduled a while ago for this up coming week on a day i was scheduled to work. I have plenty of accrued sick time to cover the shift (30ish hours accrued) The employee policy book states that after an employee has put in their notice, they can only take sick time with a doctors note. Obviously thats no problem since im going to the doctor. But theyre trying to say they won't allow it because its not an unexpected emergency, but the policy doesn't state that it needs to be. Am i legally entitled to use this sick time even after putting my notice in? If yes, and there is a specific section in the Mass general laws that states so can you cite it? I have a feeling i may need to back it up as this place consistently violates labor laws. I read through as many as i could on mass.gov but may have missed or misinderstood.
