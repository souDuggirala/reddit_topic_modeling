 A friend of mine is possibly getting arrested for check fraud in the state of Florida. He would be accused of cashing and keeping insurance checks that were issued in someone else’s name from a federal insurance policy. My friend has since spoken with the man and the man stated he doesn’t want anyone in jail. The man said he would contact the insurance company and let them know it wasn’t fraudulent or something as long as my friend made it right. They’re both in recovery for drugs and alcohol so there’s some sort of bond there. I need some advice to give him so he knows what to expect. Can the man call off the dogs in a sense with his insurance company? Should my friend hastily pay the providers in question? He wants to figure out something to do expeditiously. I think his thoughts are to pay all the money to said providers so there is no theft and missing money. He just trying to find all the records from the paperwork so he can find out who was supposed to get what payments My bet is the insurance company has already been investigating. The insurance company is not in business to be handing out money all willy nilly to a fraud.  Figured as much. He’s trying to find one in his area that’s affordable and able to represent him. Your "friend" should be talking to a lawyer.
