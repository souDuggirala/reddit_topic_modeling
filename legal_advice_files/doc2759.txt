 My spouse is currently attending a private school in Texas, and some of the things that are mandatory tuition fees seem off to me. First, lunches. The school charges $800 a semester per student for lunches, however, they don't regularly make enough food for all the students, and hold lunch in a 1 hour window that sometimes takes place up to two hours after all my spouse's classes end. We called to see if we can get that taken out of tuition fees and just not eat there, to which they replied "it is included in everyone's tuition, you have to pay it." Also, this semester there is a 3 week period where they only have class 3 days a week, but tuition is still full price as if it was full 5 days a week classes. Is there anyway to get money back or at least cheaper tuition, or are we basically SOL since it is a private institution? They can charge whatever they want. That's one of the decisions that you make when choosing schools - are you willing to pay their required fees and abide by their policies. It sucks, but that's how it works. You need the read all the paperwork your spouse signed to see what it says regarding lunches, charges, etc. You are free to not go to the school.
