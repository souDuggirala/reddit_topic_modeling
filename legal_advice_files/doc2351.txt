 Hey all. I got my first ever ticket driving home today doing 49 in a 45. The cop pulled me over he was in a marked car and I slowly passed him. I have never been pulled over in my life or been in any kind of trouble. When he issued me the ticket he said "I did you a favor and did not put a speed on it or charge you with reckless driving" etc etc. I understand I was doing 4 over but is there any way to fight this without my insurance going up or even hopefully without paying any costs? I was in Wilmington NC, it was around 10 PM, clear night. I dont know of that helps at all I am really hoping for some advice I am quite upset about the whole thing as people always do 55-60 in the area I was in so I didnt think 4 over would be a big deal.  Only you can decide if it’s worth it to take a day off and fight the ticket. But from what you said, it sounds as though you could get it dismissed, if you do decide to fight it.  I passed him going 49 and he said he was going 45  LOL he gave you a break for not writing it as reckless driving? I would certainly try to fight the ticket. Most people will laugh at getting a ticket for 4 over.  If he didn’t list your speed on the ticket it should be easy to get it dismissed.
