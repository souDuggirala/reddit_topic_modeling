 I have a hearing to have case sealed in a few weeks. Long story short a few years ago my ex-wife claimed I was harrassing her boyfriend (She was having an affair which lead to divorce) Him and I exchanged texxt messages and there was nothing harrassing in them from my end. I was ordered to go to court for a hearing and was told by the judge to go get myself booked and released. Well, my photo landed up everywhere online which I paid a lot to get down. There is one site that actually needs a sealed case to take down the photo. I wrote the judge a letter explaining what happened. As the case went on my lawyer told me to accept a deal with one count of harrassment. He made it seems like I was facing jail time if I did do it. I did and got one year unsupervised probation. Is there anything I should know or bring to the hearing in a few weeks? Thank you
