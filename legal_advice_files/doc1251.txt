 Easy one, what should my husband take to the court to show he's the guardian of our own kid to take custody of an account she's inheriting until she's an adult? The financial people want a court order. Google got me a lot of stuff about how guardianship is for when biological parents are dead or suck so much they shouldn't be parents. Not to boast or anything, but those don't apply here. Thanks, I'll look for it now that I know. Someone posted this same thing the other day. I'll find a link.  Biological father and is on the birth certificate. That's why the request for a court order proving guardianship is so strange. Is your husband the biological father? Are they not on the birth certificate?
