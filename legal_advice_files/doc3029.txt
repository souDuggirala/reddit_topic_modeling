 So i am a big fan of buffy the vampire slayer. I came across this amazing fan art of buffy on instagram that i decided to get printed on this black shirt ive got. I am worried that i can get copyright problems cos of this.. I am not selling the shirt neither am i trying to promote it or anything. I am just wearing it cos the design looks cool and matches the shirt. Can I get in trouble for this? Who is printing the shirt? You? If just you ask artist for release. If someone like me, a screen printer, we would politely decline as even though fan art has its own niche, it is still a derivative of the original art.  It was (probably) illegal for the creator to make "fan art" of a copyrighted character. It's illegal for you to make a print of someone else's work without permission. So no, it's not legal for you to appropriate intellectual property because it looks cool and matches a shirt. But as others have written, the chance that you will be in trouble for your theft is extremely slim. You could.....but no one will go after you for making a shirt. Selling it, yes that would be a problem. A one off shirt ,not really a problem...... However if you had 100 made and then started selling them. then you would have a problem "Trouble" is a vague word. If it's just you wearing it, nothing is likely to come from it, HOWEVER, you should ask the author if you can license the photo for a one-time print to cover your bases. I'd start by offering them $10 or $20 for the one-time license and see what they say.
