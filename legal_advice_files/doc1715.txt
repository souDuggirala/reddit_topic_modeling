 If my husband and I decide to divorce and we work out distribution of all of our assets by ourselves, will we need to hire lawyers? We have no children. The only thing we have together is a house and I'm sure that he would let me have it. I honestly would just want it over with as soon and clean as possible. I caught him doing something horrible, it's on video, and I am weighing my options.  I am concerned about the video of him doing something "horrible". If you threaten to publicize this video if he does not agree to your financial terms in the divorce, that may be extortion. Dont go there. If its adultery of some sort, that does not usually affect property division in MI, since Michigan is a purely no-fault state. The exception is when the adulterous partner spent marital assets on the affair. Many states have forms for DIY divorces. Personally, I would sell the house and close out all your credit cards and pay off as much debt as possible before you get divorced.  You may want to at least pay for an hour or two of a lawyers time, especially if a house is involved. We get a lot of horror stories here on r/legaladvice relating to divorces where a house transfer was not done correctly and it has long term negative effects. Specifically do not sign anything about the house until financing is finalized. He can't just sign the house over to you and be "taken off the mortgage". You would have to refinance using your financials. If you can't, the house needs to be sold. You can file for an uncontested divorce in Michigan, and you don't need a lawyer to do it. However, you think that your husband is going to make things difficult or things are likely to go south (it sounds like, from your wording, that you haven't asked him yet), consult a lawyer.  Edited to reflect my state. :) I believe location (state) will matter here.
