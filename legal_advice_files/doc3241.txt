 I was caught shoplifting and received a Misdemeanor Class B. I pled no contest and they are holding it in abeyance during my 12 month probation period, after which it will be dismissed. I have served 8 months of my probation but I need to request it to end sooner than 12 months so I can apply for jobs because I graduate soon. No one will hire me if I still have that on my record. How to I request this without using a lawyer? I understand a lawyer is always smart to use but I do not have the money and I would like to know if this request is something i can submit on my own. Any help is appreciated! Doubtful that you can accomplish this without a lawyer, to be honest. The plea deal is the agreement you reached with the district attorney. The district attorney has no incentive to renegotiate that with you now. If you want to try, you will need to research to the criminal procedure in your jurisdiction: there is usually some type of motion that can be filed to obtain relief from a court order, it is called a motion for appropriate relief in my jurisdiction, but I imagine the title varies by state. Your location is going to matter here.
