 What are the legalities around taking pictures of a textbook in which you do not own? For instance, can I enter into a college bookstore and take pictures of a textbook that I do not own? Not distributing the images themselves but took the pictures and used them for my purposes. Throwaway cause reasons. It depends on the reason. If you need one single section for an assignment (1,000 words or 10 percent of the work, whichever is less) it would fall under fair use but if you are copying it to avoid buying the book its a copywrite issue. The bookstore would probably throw you out. Beyond that, it's a violation of US copyright law to copy the entire book. You can probably use the 'fair use' defense if you are only copying a few pages for your personal use, however (e.g., the prof wants you to buy the entire textbook, but is only going to use a single chapter); ten percent is a commonly-cited standard. That would be a copyright violation. Yes, even if you're not distributing the images and just using them to study from.
