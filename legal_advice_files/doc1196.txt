 Hello. Not sure I am in the right area or not. I will start by saying that I am no HVAC genius.. but I moved into a new apartment a couple weeks ago. The heater was turning on and off every 7-10 minutes. I am on the first floor so I anticipated it to run more but that seemed like a lot. Well then one day it just stopped heating. The thermostat was at 67 and it wouldn’t get higher than 62. I had the maintenance people come out 3 separate times and they kept telling me everything was fine. Finally on the 4th time, the guy replaced a wire and it finally got back to normal heat (67). However it was still running a lot (half the day) so I had film put over my windows to keep the breeze out and it helped a little. Well I get home from work today and it’s stuck at 62 degrees again. I am so tired of them telling me nothing is wrong when something clearly is. It’s going to be -10 with the windchill here this upcoming week so I told them I need it fixed (again). I have also contacted my lawyer. I am waiting for him to get in tomorrow morning, but I am just curious what I can sue them for. I would consider that not habitable/negligence? Any advice on the legal aspect or HVAC would be much appreciated. Call over to the Indiana Housing Community Development Authority, (317) 234-7777.
