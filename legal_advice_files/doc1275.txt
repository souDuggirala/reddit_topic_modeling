 TL;DR: Fiance's parents are losing their house, do we hace to pay for their negligence because we live with them? My fiance and I live with her parents, we just found out their house is getting foreclosed on. The problem is theres a line in the paper saying something along the lines of "John and Jane Does, said names being fictitious, tenants, are made party defendants to this action for any leashold possessory or other interest they may have in to or against the subject premises by virtue of their occupancy." Does that mean we're part of this sinking ship even though we have nothing to do with it? Thank you for the quick response btw, my old lady's having a panic attack over this so you helped put her at ease. Nope we have no legal or finacial ties to the house. I assume neither you nor your fiance are listed on the mortgage? If so, you two aren't going to be responsible for paying anything to the bank. The bank is just required to give notice to occupants, which includes the two of you. No we don't pay rent, we planned on moving out soon anyway so its not being homeless that worrys us. We'd honestly help them pay off the debt if they wanted to but theyre just gonna let everything crash and burn and I don't want us to get stuck cleaning up a mess they refuse to. Well, the bank is foreclosing on the property. So the bank has to give notice to the owners and any occupants of the property (such as you and your fiance). I assume that you do not have a written lease with your parents whereby you pay rent every month? Basically, if your parents lose their home, you and your fiance cannot stay there. So to that extent, yes you are part of the sinking ship.
