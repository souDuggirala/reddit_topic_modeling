  I know it's not likely to happen, but If a person worked in an illegal cannabis dispensary prior to legalization and quit before the laws changed, is that something they could still be charged for in the future?  There are producers who are licensed by the federal government to grow marijuana. You need a license to grow beyond a personal use scale. The application process is complex and strict. The provinces which allow private shops require a license to open up such a shop, and the licensing process is also relatively complex for that. What are legal producers and legal vendors? Google was no help I think. Theoretically it is possible. It is much more likely to interfere with your ability to participate in a legal producer or vendor.
