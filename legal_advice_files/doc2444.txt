 My old job won't stop paying me. I worked in a very large state public job. I have contacted 3 different supervisors and I'm still getting paid. I resigned in September and noticed at the end of October. Started in November trying to get them to stop. What happens from here? How does this effect my taxes? You are right, this is going to make a mess for your taxes. You cannot keep the money, regardless of what they do to your taxes, so you need to put it aside for when they finally accept the fact they are messing up and want it back. You will also need to ask for corrected documents for when you file your taxes, which will fix that particular problem. I would try to avoid filing your taxes until you get this resolved. If you have been contacting people over the phone, it is time to start writing certified letters. Try going to HR directly.  Since it's been so long, consider [contacting your State Assembly Member]() and telling them that you left your state job three months ago, but no matter what you do you can't get them to stop paying you. They may be able to get some results. You should be able to get them to send a corrected w2 for tax purposes if they send you one with extra income uncluded. Probably shouldn’t file until it’s correct  What about my taxes? They are going to be all screwed up. You are definitely not entitled to money you didn’t earn and when they decide they want it back you will be expected to return it. (My wife had an overpayment issue with her last employer) Keep it aside safely until resolved and you can return funds without issue. IANAL, but I suggest setting aside all that money just in case they come after it. Continue to contact them, maybe their HR department. I cannot stress enough to not spend the money. Thanks that's a good idea r/personalfinance may be able to help you as well
