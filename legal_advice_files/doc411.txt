 Hi All, I am starting a small business and was advised by my accountant to use S-Corp as the legal structure. Filing for the certificate is pretty straight forward except for this [one section]() where it asks if I want any of these optional statements added to the certificate; Should I add any of these? If so why? Also, after I file for the certificate, get my state and federal tax IDs and get a bank account, is there anything I need to do from a legal standpoint? Or am I all ready to go? I've been trying to get in touch with my lawyer for days with no luck and I really want to get this done so I can start contacting suppliers for products officially and begin preparation to set my store up. Thank you in advance! I appreciate any advice/answers to these questions that are offered.
