My friend got 2 dui’s in 4 months.

Long story short, his parents are insane, but helpful with money.  They loaned him money for his lawyer, but then went to that lawyer and told her to recommend a harsh sentence.

The judge was about to assign something like 10 days and probation, but his OWN lawyer intervened and told the judge to sentence him to more time.  He ended up having to do 70 days in jail and 3 months in rehab.

It’s all on video.

Can he do anything about this?

He just contacted me and told me what happened - and I’m turning to reddit for advice for him.

We live in Ohio.

EDIT: he had already resolved the first DUI and paid the penalty.  This was his court case for the second.

EDIT 2: the judge was literally giving the sentence, and his attorney interrupted him to convince the judge to give a harsher sentence.  If your friend really believes the lawyer didn't act in his best interest he can complain to the bar, assuming this is what really happened. I have a feeling it's a little more coming and your friend, who is an untreated alcoholic, is not a reliable narrator. He can file a complaint with the bar association. He can hire another lawyer and see if there is a chance he could fight that on the grounds on ineffective counsel.   But it sounds like he needs rehab,.
