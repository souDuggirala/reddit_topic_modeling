 Background: I had an order of protection against my 8 y/o daughter’s father after he pushed her into a wall and he admitted to hitting her via text and in court. The judge dismissed the order of protection and instead put in place a no corporal punishment order. My ex husband is now gloating, sending me messages that I’m a liar and that the judge “saw right through you.” I stand by my statements i placed in the order of protection. Is it likely that the judge believed the events occurred, hence the no corporal punishment order, but did not think the events constituted domestic violence, hence quashing the OOP? Thanks.  That sounds like a reasonable read of the situation to me. Maybe her father claimed he was doing it to teach her a lesson, like as part of discipline, and the judge believed him. If you have a lawyer, I suggest consulting them on what to do next.  There are a lot of people, judges included, who believe that children can and should be assaulted at the whim of the parents. Whether this particular judge believes that, it's impossible to say. We can't read the judge's mind. You should stop communicating with your ex except as necessary to handle custody transfers, etc.
