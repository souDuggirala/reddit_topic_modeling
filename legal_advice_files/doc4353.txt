 Hey guys, so earlier this year I was driving and was pulled over by an officer because he ran my plate at the red light we were stopped at and apparently it was the wrong license plate. This happened in Pittsburgh, PA. However, the car did not belong to me, the car was bought for me by my father, who was deceased before I was pulled over, but the car was in his name. The officer ended up confiscating the plate and citing me and I was forced to get the car towed myself back to my house. I decided to contest the citation he gave me as, considering my father had just recently passed and Iâ€™m only 18, and I do not live with my mother, I did not have the money to pay for it. So I ended up sending in the citation through the mail system and pleaded not guilty. It is not about 3-4 months later and I have not received any letters from the courts or anything regarding the situation, should I be worried that it got lost in the mail or does this just take a really long time?
