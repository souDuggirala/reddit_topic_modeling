 I live in Los Angeles and my apartment recently flooded with rain water. The building maintenance discovered that it was a foundation issue with the concrete and has said that I will have to move apartments. I was wondering what legal recourse do have. Could I break the lease? Or recoup any moving costs etc?  The amount of days of rent you paid that the apartment was in a disrepaired situation. Gather evidence as well, so that if the landlord refuses you can take him to small claims court for the rent you paid for unliveable housing.  So they’re now saying that they might be able to bring the original builder in to fix it without me having to move. I don’t know how optimistic that is given that the floor is dipping in. Anyways I have to live in the apartment with the water seeping in and have taken multiple days off from work to deal with it. Even if I don’t have to move in the end, could I still recoup some of my losses? What would be appropriate to request? Yes, since the property you rented is uninhabitable you can break the lease. You can also ask the landlord to return any rent that you paid for days lived in the damaged property. If he refuses, sue him in small claims court for the value of the days of rent paid to live in an uninhabitable property.
