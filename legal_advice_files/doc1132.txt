 I've brought this up to the complex multiple times and each time I've received an email a couple days later that it's either been fixed or there's nothing wrong with it. It's so loud that we can't have it on during the night or it becomes impossible to sleep. I'm also afraid it's a fire hazard bound to cause sparks and fires due the grinding metal inside the machine. I am furious with the complex, but I know that the kids at the front desk don't control when and where the management and maintenance man divide their time so I'm not gonna go yell at them. At what point am I allowed to take legal action against the complex to get a replacement machine for my apartment? I'll post a video later if I can to give you an idea of how loud this damned thing is so you'll understand what I'm dealing with.
