I've been in a rental complex for about six years. The managing agent was sold a few years back, and the new ownership approaches any issues with the cheapest band-aid fixes possible. It's a pre-war building, so we run into heat/hot water issues fairly often, especially during the winter. I'd estimate that the last two years, we averaged a day and a half with service interruptions every week. I work from home, so three days out of every two weeks is incredibly inconvenient to say the least.

The heat and hot water both stopped without warning about three hours ago. I touched base with the super, and he intimated that we're in store for another winter of the same shit. Great. We're actually expecting to close the deal on a co-op in late January. Paying the rent here on top of the mortgage/maintenance at the new place is well within our means, and we were actually hoping to have a few months of overlap to make the move easier. Our lease runs through June, but we'll likely be ready to get out of here well before then.

The hope is that we'll be able to negotiate a reasonable early termination penalty, but the lease says absolutely nothing about this. Do the constant plumbing issues cross a threshold of habitability or anything along those lines that might give us some leverage when discussing breaking the lease? If we do have any leverage, what would be the best way to approach this?

Thanks. It varies. The longest I can recall was about 26 hours. Scheduled work* usually starts at 9am and runs till about 6pm. There have been a few times that it was done in three or four hours, but those are incredibly rare.

*This usually means &lt;24 hours notice posted in the elevator and is phase 2 of one of the patchwork "repairs" I mentioned in my post. How long is the heat/hot water out when it's out?
