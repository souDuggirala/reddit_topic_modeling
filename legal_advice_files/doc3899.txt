 Hey Everyone, So I went to a SUNY school from 2012-2015, before tuition became free in the state. In my last year there, I was set to secure loan funding before proceeding to my final year, but due to a death in the family, my cosigner had to back out and take out loans for the funeral arrangements, which ultimately left me being denied for the loan. At the same time, I had been a NYS resident since 2013, and due to my age, I was still being considered a dependent upon my parents who live out of state even though I had filed taxes on my own, and as a dependent of my uncle whom I lived with when not in school. I was also not dependent upon my parents, as I did not have any financial ties to them, nor did I have adequate housing in that state, my parents having lost the home due to foreclosure. I have on record presenting these documents to them since 2013, until my last date of attendance in 2015, when they finally approved my request for in-state tuition. At that point however, I had no access to a loan source or way to pay off the debt owed to the school, and as a result the account was sent to the AG's office in Albany for collection. I asked if it would be possible to apply it retroactively from the date I first submitted the documents, but it looks like a no-go. Fast forward to today, I worked multiple jobs for a year until being able to secure an okay paying job at a university that offers 100 percent tuition remission, but due to the debt owed (20k, currently on a payment plan that's rather aggressive), my transcript is being held as collateral until it is settled. I have no problem paying off the debt but with the current state of things I feel like I'll never finish college. Is there any way I could get a temporary release in order to continue studies? Or is there something I may have overlooked?
