 I want to do something that will show that I am interested in changing the world, so I'll take small steps by creating an interactive app like this. This'll look good on my college applications, so, yeah, that's why I'm doing this if anyone is wondering. You can absolutely create a VR experience teaching mathematics. You cannot use copyrighted intellectual property in the experience (i.e. characters, stories, etc. created and owned by others) without the copyright holder's permission; no one "owns" math itself. As long as you come up with the material by yourself, you can certainly do that. But you can't just copy a textbook into VR form.
