 I think most everyone has heard that the correct first response to police questioning should always be “I want to speak to my lawyer.” But if a person has had no previous experience with the legal system and consequently doesn’t know a criminal defense lawyer, how would they go about obtaining trustworthy and effective legal counsel? I suppose it’s one thing if you haven’t been detained and have the luxury of time and freedom to conduct your search, but what if you’ve been arrested and are in custody? I have a hard time seeing the police assisting with a search for your legal counsel beyond finding a public defender to help you in court. So is it a good idea then for people to have the contact info for a good criminal defense lawyer handy just in case they need it on short notice?
