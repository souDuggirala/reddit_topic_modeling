 Sorry if this is not the right place to post! The basic TLDR of the situation is: I was going to move into a house in PA with 3 other people (right off my college campus), paid the security deposit, then backed out once the lease was sent out, realizing it was way more than I can afford. And now the realty company is refusing to return my security deposit, and I did not sign anything, and it was never made explicitly clear that this deposit was non-refundable like they are claiming. They are claiming that I cannot get the deposit back because I'm bound by a lease that the other people signed, but I did not. They are also claiming that their company policy states that the deposit is nonrefundable, even though not explicitly. stated anywhere. The way I see it is that I paid for a service (Payment of any damages to the house had I lived there), and I did not receive that service, thus I deserve my money back. Do I have a leg to stand on if they still refuse to refund my payment, and I file a dispute with my bank? If I do go ahead and file a dispute, and it does not return in my favor, will I have any bad repercussions for filing the dispute?
