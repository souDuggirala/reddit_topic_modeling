 Three years ago I was caught in a bad situation and was with a group of friends - some of which who stole. Because we were affiliated with one another and as a group, we were all punished. However, I personally did not steal anything. I was not arrested or booked, and my pictures and fingerprints were not taken. However, I did have to sign something (citation?) and I would appear in court. I hired a lawyer and she entered a plea of "Not Guilty" and my case was dismissed on the spot because I believe the officer did not show up or turn in the citation. My case was not dismissed with deferred, it was just dismissed immediately and I did not have to go through deferred disposition or anything. Now I'm wondering how this will affect my background check, if I had a dismissed case where I plead Not Guilty? I do not want this to ruin my chances. Also, the corporation is HEAD QUARTERED, in California. From my understanding, in CA they can not use non-convicted cases against you. However, I'm working in the sector in Texas, so I don't know if the same rules apply even though this large company is headquartered in California and that's where their HR is.
