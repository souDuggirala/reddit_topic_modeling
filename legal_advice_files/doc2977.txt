 So I just got a notice on my door TODAY that they are going to be replacing our windows in the occupied apartments starting TOMORROW. So last month our apartment complex was bought out and they started some pretty huge renovations. They have been drilling and pounding 6 days a week. But have yet to enter any occupied units besides to tear all the balconies down and replace them. Now they are giving us a days notice that they will be enter our apartment to tear our window out and put a new one in. Are they allowed to do this, or what rights do I have for this sort of thing? I know right!? It can't come soon enough. And on top of that 8 contractors in my home as well, it's so irritating. Thanks! I understand totally how you feel though. I hate when my landlord comes in my home. It makes me feel really violated and uncomfortable. Cant wait to be a home owner. Good luck with everything! I appreciate the help It depends on what your lease says. I live in KY and the general lease agreement states they can enter your home for inspections or renovations with a 24 hour notice. Or in case of emergency. But I have had a lease that started the landlord could enter the unit during reasonable times for reasonable cause. It all depends on what you signed.
