 The leasing office of my previous residence is threatening to file a Second Cause of Action for damages but my lease was up last month and I paid everything in full and on time every month. Every article I’m finding about what a Second Cause is, is pointing back to first being evicted and aren’t giving me clear answers on what exactly is expected of us or what it even is. We haven’t seen a bill for the damages yet and this is the first correspondence I’ve had with the leasing office since mid-December. They haven’t even given us a chance to pay the bill. Is this normal? They also emailed saying that they were filing a judgement against us that will land on our credit reports but we haven’t even been given the chance to pay for anything yet. Can we be sent to collections without them even attempting to collect for themselves first?
