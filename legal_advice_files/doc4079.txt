 Hi everyone, I am a man living in NYC and I have a boss who is female. I work in the HR department and I am a VP while by boss is a C level employee. My boss is also the leader of our companies Womenâ€™s Engineering extracurricular group and is also in the LGBTQ group as well, although she isnâ€™t a leader of that group. Since the first week, my boss has sexually harassed me. It started with unwelcome and unwanted comments like â€œnice pants, guy! Think you could maybe hide that bulge a little better? ðŸ¤” ðŸ˜‰ â€œ Then it progressed to her touching me in more generic places like my arms, shoulders, etc. Now itâ€™s progressed to her slapping my butt and grabbing my penis. Oh and she flicks my nipples. She has never texted me, emailed me or chatted me anything inappropriate so I have nothing of that matter to go by. I also donâ€™t believe I am allowed to record her in the office without her consent. Iâ€™ve discreetly looked for cameras on the inside of the building but there are none on our floor other than the elevator Bay Area. I have no one to complain to because she would be the one to receive the complaints. I also have no faith in reporting it to the board of executives because she is the nice of the chairman of the board. Iâ€™ve spoken with one attorney who advised me to just quit because of the deck stacked against me - especially her relation to the chairman of the board + her privileged status in the workplace as a woman + her involvement with the womenâ€™s engineering and lgbtq empowerment clubs. I canâ€™t afford to quit, as my child has very serious health problems and I cannot got without income from just quitting like that. Any help would be much appreciated.
