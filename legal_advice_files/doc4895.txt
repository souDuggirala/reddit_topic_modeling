 I live in California. My partner and I moved into a place at the end of September. Its 3 bedroom, 2 bath house. A week ago after I showered water started shooting out from under the toilets. We called and went back and forth for almost two days. Eventually they had us call a plumber. We paid $100 to have the drain snaked. But were without a bathroom for 3 days (yay for peeing in a bucket and going to the fast food place). My partner had the lovely job of cleaning up two fecal covered floors. A few days ago I showered and the toilets did the same thing. Again they tried to blame us for the problem. The owner came out and has been tearing out the bathroom for 2 days now (yeah for peeing in a bucket again). Again my partner is going to be left with sanitizing everything. If this happens again, is it within our right to withhold a month's rent and ask for the deposit back so we can move?  Oof ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜©  Is there a point where they have to pay for a hotel? We've been without working plumbing in both bathrooms since Tuesday? Or do I have to file a claim on my rental insurance? Itâ€™s a rental, repairs are the landlords problem. Demand your money back for the plumber and pro-rated rent for every day the house was uninhabitable because of the lack of a toilet.
