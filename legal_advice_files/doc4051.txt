 I wrote a book that was adapted to a film with a cult following, and someone is selling a lot of posters and other artwork on Amazon and Etsy. It looks like what this seller does is take the existing poster and just recreate it slightly differently and then sell it. S/he is also selling quotes as posters, clothing, and all kind of stuff like shower curtains and mugs! But the thing that's particularly frustrating to me is: this person is even selling an abridged retelling of my book, same title and everything, just a couple of words added. No, it's not legal, copyright covers derivative works. Look for a copyright lawyer. File a DMCA complaint on every one of their listings. They may dispute it, and in that case you will need a lawyer. that's not the usual type of thing covered under fair use. Talk to your publisher and see if they can recommend a good lawyer that's worked with cross media issues. They probably have someone they use regularly anyway. If that's not viable, try your agent, they almost always know a few entertainment and copyright lawyers. The abridged version is full on copyright violation. Not even close to being fair use at all. You should probably consult with an attorney to see if a) you have a valid claim and b) whether itâ€™s worth pursuing. I would look first at organizations that provide free or reduced cost legal services to artists.
