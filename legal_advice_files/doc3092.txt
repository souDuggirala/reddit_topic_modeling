 Recently my significant other was drinking excessively. It led to him beating me while our children were the but away from it. I didn't have major noticeable injuries but bruises all over and soreness for two days. He has only done this one time prior and strangled me which he was drunk as well. He is typically a happy guy besides stress of our children and typical marriage stress. He is only aggressive when he drinks. He had a Jan court date but was suddenly moved to Feb. He can have no contact with me or our kids. He his staying with his family who tell me nothing and give no updates on how he is. I am a stay at home mom and have no money since he was my financial support. I contacted the DA representing me to find out more on his case and since it's the holidays everything is backed up. She stated she had to contact me anyways. He can also move his court date up from February if he wanted. His attorneys or lawyers claim he can now have supervised visitation with the kids. But the DA claims he should've been able to see them since he got bailed out. She mentioned a DV place where there a resources for him to see the girls and help me. I texted his parents the good news and they got angry saying I shouldn't have called her (although she said she had to call me anyways) and stating I didn't want their help from his lawyers to allow the kids visitation. I'd was just informing them we had other recourses that id found out about as well. Note she asked about our relationship and I stated he was a good guy that just needs counseling and support that I didn't feel jail time was necessary im confused about all of this moving the date back 2 months and that his parents are angry I talked to someone representing myself. They don't even tell me anything unless I ask. Even then I get ignored sometimes.  Post deleted. No legal question
