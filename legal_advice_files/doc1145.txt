 As the title says and speaking for my wife, her valet company for her work lost her key. It's a small and it's free as a courtesy. The main concern is that the valet lost the key at the place of her employment with very few cars. That means whoever found or stole the key, can easily take 10 seconds to click around, find her car and steal it, if she wanted to. They agreed to replace the key from Toyota. But unfortunately not a push to start key where I believe Toyota could disable the old key from working. It's last years model but with it being a physical key, I don't think there's anything Toyota can do to prevent the old key from working. Now this is a HUGE burden because now every day we have to worry if someone is going to steal her car. Is there anything we can do? I would love for the valet to replace whatever is necessary so that the old key doesn't work anymore and so only a new key would work. Is this possible? Looking for any suggestions on this situation. Thank you thank you for the info and the steps to take. i'm definitely going to do this. i've never taken anyone to small claims before so we'll see how that goes if it gets there. ty Locks can be changed on car doors and in the ignition, and the remote sensor can be reprogrammed. I suggest start by getting a price quote on those from the dealer, and then asking the valet service if they’d be willing to cover it (or part of it). If not, you can take them to small claims court for that amount - I’m not seeing anything in that contract that says they’re not liable for loss of a key, but I could be mistaken.
