 So, I had to leave my last place of employment due to shady business practices that I didn't agree with. I left without a 2 week notice and now the GM is holding my last check until I go pick it up from him personally after he said he mailed it. Is this legal in the state of Florida? Thanks for any help you can give!  I drove into town today to try to pick it up. Only after getting the labour department involved did he finally agree to meet me. Once I was there he berated me repeatedly with harsh language and threatened me as I was leaving with "See you soon buddy. Watch your back!" This guy is seriously unstable. I contacted the regional/owner/HR through email detailing the incident. Thank you all for your help. I really appreciate it.  Ask him if hes willing to mail it to you if you send him a self addressed envelope  I'm now living out of state and he is refusing to send it. Can he hold it indefinitely?  [removed] You're in Florida so you have no State Dept of Labor. Is there a reason you cannot just go get it? Most employers require you collect your last check. Is there some reason that's impossible?
