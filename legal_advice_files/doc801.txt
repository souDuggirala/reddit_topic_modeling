 My friends and I are all going to a local water park for our senior skip day, however, the park requires a waiver to be signed. Myself, along with a few other friends, are 18 while the rest of us are 17 year olds. It’s a 45 minute drive to the park and they obviously don’t want to drag their parents along. Is it legal for me, an 18 year old, to sign their waiver for them, a 17 year old. All help is appreciated, thanks!  You should call them and ask. I'm surprised that a water park would require a parental waiver for a 17 year old. Waterparks are not particularly dangerous and a 17 year old is old enough to be a lifeguard. If they do require a parental waiver, perhaps they can email it to your friend who can get their parent to sign it, and then bring that with them. You could always see if they have a waiver online that you can print out and have their parents sign ahead of time. the park may not allow it as they may require a parent or legal guardian to sign a waiver so you’ll want to check their policy.  Check requirements with the park themselves. Their policies may go beyond what the law does.  Not unless you’re the parent or guardian of them.
