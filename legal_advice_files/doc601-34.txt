I recently had a vendor for a private event fail to deliver on their services. I'm working on getting a refund without going to court, but I'm being met with some resistance so I'm now contemplating filing in small claims court. The question is, if I reside in NY, the vendor resides in NJ, and the event took place in NJ, where should I file? Thank you. You would need to file wherever the Defendant's place of business is located.
