 Couldn’t think of a way to word the title. I haven’t seen anything like this looking things up so I hope someone can help me. Location Virginia. I started at job, Company A, 6 months after they got rid of pensions for new hires(sucks but I’m ok with it). 3 years later company spins our section of company off into let’s call it Company B. Everyone who had enough points for retirement with Company A was able to collect their pensions and still work with Company B(good for them). Everyone who did not have their points Company B agreed to make up the difference. Such as Having 10points with Company A Company B would contribute the rest to make their pension whole. All of this I am ok with and could care less one day or another. My problem, which I’m not sure if there is even anything I can do, is that retirees who collect their full pensions from Company A and are working for Company B are able to collect points for a full pension with Company B while I would get nothing. Am I crazy to think if people got their full pension from Company A that Company B should not give them a pension without also giving me(and others who hired after new contract) one?
