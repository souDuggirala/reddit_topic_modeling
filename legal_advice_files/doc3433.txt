 [Card.com]() cancelled my 2 cards 3 card account and suspended 3rd card with $4000 balance. Then customer service said I had to show proof of reload in order to retrieve my own money. Meanwhile they are charging $10 monthly fee in suspended account. The funds in my account were then embezzled by [Card.com]() account balance $0.00. I submitted a complaint to [Card.com]() and was ignored. Consumer Fraud. This company is a scam. Thieves. No excuse. Period. []()  Call your local police department and file a report. That's all you can do and you'll probably not get your money back.
