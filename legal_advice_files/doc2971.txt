 Hey guys, just looking to see what I can do about this as I've never had to deal with this before. Recently my GF and I moved into a new place in Utah that underwent a change of management during the whole signing process. The new management had us sign a lease that had an incorrect address on it and have been telling us that they will get us a revised lease "soon". In the lease they promised us a garage and a free month (as part of a signing bonus from the previous management). Well, here we are two weeks later and still no garage, no move in checklist, no revised lease, no garage (according to them, due to not being able to find an open garage), and on top of it, our mailbox key doesn't open our mailbox. I've been in their office every day to check on them but they keep giving me the run around saying that their system isn't working or they're still checking. Wondering if I have any recourse or what steps I should take to put pressure on them to fix this.
