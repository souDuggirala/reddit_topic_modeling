 Certain laws for Nurse Practice Acts repeatedly say the term “in good faith.” What does “good faith” mean when taking care of people and initiating treatments/interventions? How does it relate to common practices on the unit or hospital in which somebody works? Good faith in a contact essentially means nothing as good faith is subjective and it’s very difficult to prove someone didn’t act in good faith  r/legaladviceofftopic
