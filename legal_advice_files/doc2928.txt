 okay so im 16 and i recently got called up to the office at my school and got my bag searched. they didnt find any of my important things but what they did find was a old bag of THC wax (just the bag, nothing in it) that says Apothecary extracts on front. I got not just suspended, i got a ticket for minor in possesion of marijuana parephenalia(not sure if a bag counts but ok). I bought this wax about a month ago maybe? but my current alibi is that ive had it for a long amount of time(close to a year) in my bag. Starting to think this alibi isnt a good one and if the bag has any dates on it i'm overðŸ˜‚ Good thing is that since this is my first offense, i can wipe my record clean with doing a $130 class that i would do over the weekends. My parents are going hard on me and telling me how im going to end up a meth addict and how this is gonna land me in juvy. How do you guys think the court is going to respond and how much of a headache is this gonna be to get off my record and be over with? Yeah it had real marijuana concentrate in it, i had used it before. But it was an obviously labeled bag that had THC written in it over 1000 times. Im just saying at the time of searching it had nothing inside of the bag. Wait so is it actually drugs or just commonly associated? Because if you never had marijuana in it you could probably have them do a chemical test to clear you.
