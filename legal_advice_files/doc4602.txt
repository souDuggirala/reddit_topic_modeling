 New Braunfels requires you to restrain your animal and not let them run at large or stray. [=](=) Section 5. New braunfels tx  I think leash laws are based on each state (or even city) so you will need to look that up. Independent of this situation, your neighbor most likely needs to leash their dog if they dont have an electric fence. But even though their dog was not leashed, neither was yours. Your dog went onto their property. If their dog was leashed, this event most likely would have stilled happened since your dog went up to theirs on their property. If their dog was off their property, the story would be a little different. Your dog was unleashed and roaming. That dog was on its property. I really hate to tell you this, but this is the result of your failure to properly leash and control your dog, not your new neighbors.  If your dog wandered off your property and onto their property, I'm not sure that the neighbors are going to have much liability in this situation. What is your location?
