 First of all, I hope that this post is within the rules. As this is a procedural question I don't believe that any more details are required. So, on November 10 I received a speeding ticket in a small town in central TN/USA, about an hour from where I live. 80 in a 65. My ticket ordered me to send in and plead guilty, or appear in General Session Court on December 10, which I elected to show for. Upon arrival, it was clear that court is not in session and everyone is directed to the Court Clerk's bay of windows instead. There, I am offered to either pay a fine or go to traffic school, in order to have it expunged. They make no mention of court. I sign nothing, but opt for the traffic school option. They tell me I have 60 days to complete it and I go on my way. Upon leaving I find out from the Sheriff that the judge is out of town for the holiday. Again, this is Dec. 10th. It is my understanding that I have the right to a court-trial within 45 days of the alleged infraction. This would mean that they have to produce a judge by December 25th, correct? Is this something I could have pushed to my advantage? May I still be able to? Subjective, but would you do it for the $300? You would have a bench trial before a judge, who decides the case.  So what happens if I choose not to accept guilt? No. You were likely in a Circuit Court. You do not have a right to trial by jury in Circuit Court. Most states do not provide the right to trial by jury for minor misdemeanors and traffic offenses.
