 I lived in New York my whole life until this August when I moved to Idaho. I’m going to school and don’t even plan to stay a full calendar year before returning to New York. My New York license expired shortly after I moved to Idaho. The other day I bought a vehicle and planned to go get an Idaho license and get the car on the road. My question is, when I get that license, am I an Idaho resident? Is there a way to get the car registered in New York and stay a New York resident? Next year when I return I’ll likely want to attend more school as a New York resident, saving thousands vs attending as an out of state student. I basically want to know how I can get this car on the road and still be a New York resident next year for school. Sorry if this is a 10 second google question or the wrong sub Thanks and best   In the circumstance you described, no you are not. Can you not have the vehicle titled and registered in New York? And why not renew your New York license online? Sorry I’m pretty naive on this. So just by having an apartment in Idaho I’m a resident? I thought there was a one year period required or something similar  [removed] No, you can't get a drivers license for a state you're not a resident of. I think you're confusing car registration with state residency, they are two different things.  Okay, so I can get an ID drivers license and still maintain citizenship in New York? Well your license expiring is the real issue. You can register the car in Idaho and still be a NY resident as if you're only there for school you don't need to become a resident of the state unless you want to attempt to see if you'd qualify for in-state tuition. You won't be able to get an ID drivers license if you can't prove residency in the state.
