 So I asked my college to be opted out of their marketing emails and this is their response: FS(college I attend) student email addresses are college-owned email addresses and are a primary source for us to communicate information to students. We are not able to remove it from the system to only receive selected emails. Coming from a marketing agency, I know the implications of personal emails, but college owned emails are different. Do I have grounds to ask them to remove me from their marketing communications? Their marketing emails are cluttering my academic inbox with junk. Edit: US-based. Can cite EU's GDPR rules and regulations.
