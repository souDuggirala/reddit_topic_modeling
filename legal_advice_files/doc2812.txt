 My friend was arrested for DUI and Implied consent last December. When he visited his attorney the attorney printed off the two police reports and they contained his picture and DOB. However, the narrative for each were about a woman arrested across town that same night. The woman's arrest reports did not include my friend's stuff. So, The attorney states he is going to hope the thing gets pushed a year out without someone noticing and that then it will be dropped for Statute of Limitation. However, I feel like even if someone does catch it, this large of an error will at least impugn the State's case. My friend's attorney said he had never seen anything like that. My friend talked to me about it because my mom is an attorney and she hasn't seen anything like this either. Buddy doesn't want to post for obvious reasons. Anybody out there with any advice or thoughts or especially experience with this kind of oversight would be much appreciated. Thanks! He doesn’t want to post it to his account. And he is going to listen to his attorney. Nobody’s asking for a well crafted defense here. Just experience or advice.  He should listen to his attorney
