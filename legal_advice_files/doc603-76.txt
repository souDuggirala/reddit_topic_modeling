Is there anything I can do about a previous employer lying about me driving a company vehicle for them? I’m trying to get a second job and they need a reference for driving, something even as simple as a pizza delivery driver. Anyway is there something I can do about this legally? State of Pennsylvania  This might come down to whether your previous employer is lying about your responsibilities, or whether your previous employer is simply refusing to divulge your responsibilities. [deleted] Did you have any co workers that work(ed) at the job who can speak to your driving of a company vehicle? If all they need is a reference, I dont see why you couldn't use someone you know will speak truthfully  Generally yes I’m not sure exactly what they said but that’s what the company I’m applying for told me  What is the previous employer saying?  That you did not drive for them, when you actually did?
