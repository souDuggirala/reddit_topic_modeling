 Let me start by saying, I have been a lurker for a long time. I dont understand laws and how they can affect us, but because of all of you I was able to work up the confidence and file a formal complaint with the EEOC regarding the failure to provide a work place accommodation for my 10 lbs weight restrictions. I know i just opened a can of worms im by no means ready for, but for someone who suffers with major depression this was a huge step for me. The first of many I believe, however over the year(s) reading your stories and comments has givin me enough knowledge to reach out, and I was right! They were in violation of ADA. So from one lurker to the rest of you, Thank you. Here is to hoping I dont need surgery. Mods sorry if I broke the rules, I looked but couldnt find it any where. P.S. excuse my typos im on mobile, and I havent taken my pain meds for my shoulder as I spent 3+ hrs driving to their office and wasnt comfortable doing so on them. Im gonna go get some icyhot and take them now. Have good day!  üëè
