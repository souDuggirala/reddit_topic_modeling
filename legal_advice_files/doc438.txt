 I have screenshots from my banking app proving that I renewed my data cycle January 9th so it should be renewed February 9th you'd think? I set up auto withdrawal with them because talking to the Customer support people is a long process for me and the last time I ended up talking to someone who mumbled and made it difficult for me to hear them even with speaker on. I check my bank account just make sure everything is the way it should be and notice my account is now in the negatives. I check it out as my dad has had a problem with taking money as he pleases. But see that it's from Straight Talk and that it was Auto withdrawal. It's a no contract phone plan as it's month to month and I was supposed to receive some money bank tomorrow to have enough for auto-draw. Do I simply call them to make a complaint and is this sort of thing legal?  Alright I never realized that as I was never told about it before thank you for clearing that up! Oh yes, it's legal. They generally have a clause that you accept when you enable auto pay that states they will take the payment X days before the due date. For example, my bill is due on the 11th and my auto pay is going to withdraw on the 9th. It's in the terms and conditions (that nobody ever reads). You agreed to it. Now, you may be able to call your bank and tell them you've got a deposit coming in that will zero out your account and MAYBE you can get them to waive the NFS fee (as long as you don't do this all the time).
