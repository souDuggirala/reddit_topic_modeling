 I was seeing the same doctor for a few years and went to make my annual appointment with her and found out she was no longer practicing with the clinic, so I started seeing another doctor. Recently I found out my old doctor is practicing with an HMO provider. I am not a member of the HMO and tried to make an appointment with my old doctor, but was told that I could not be seen unless I was a member. It seems like they shouldn't be aloud to be exclusionary, but what do I know? Just wondering if I have a case? Ok thanks! Actually doctors can decline to see you for any reason as long as it is not due to gender, race, religion, age or other protected classes. It is possible that the clinic is set up to be an exclusive provider for that HMO. It can be more efficient if there is only one insurance plan, one billing rate, one copay for all patients etc. It greatly reduces staff cost and uncertainty about what treatment, medication, testing is going to be approved for patients.
