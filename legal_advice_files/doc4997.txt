 Hi legaladvice, I moved out of a Texas Apartment complex two days ago, and they notified me of supposed damages two hours ago. They informed me after sending that email, they have sent the debt to collections, and informed me how this will damage my credit. “Your account will be assigned to a third party collection company upon the receipt of this letter. Leaving a balance outstanding on your account can negatively impact your credit and potentially make it difficult for you to lease with another management company in the future.” They gave me the debt collection company’s information. Is this legal to send me to debt collection with no chance to discuss these charges? Charges are about $800 for new carpet and some paint. I have so many questions about this, and I’m worried that they’ve already done damage to me by reporting this without giving me any chance to dispute. I can’t seem to find any rules on how fast they can just send me to collections. Appreciate any help. Thanks!  Correct.  Oh that makes sense. They’re having someone else collect, outsourcing collecting. However they shouldn’t immediately report it to credit bureaus, correct? It’s perfectly legal to refer your debt to a third party agency. That doesn’t necessarily mean a delinquent debt has been reported on your credit, and that shouldn’t yet be the case here. If you pay it in a timely manner it shouldn’t be an issue.
