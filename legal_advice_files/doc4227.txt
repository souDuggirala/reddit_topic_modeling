 Background: I work in North Chicago, saw a 2006 Toyota 4Runner V8 I liked for sale 4 hours away. I had my fiancee take a look at it for me. She negotiated on the price, but after finding out the timing belt had not been replaced asked them replace the timing belt. They said no, so she walked out. They stopped her, told her okay, if you pay $100 more, we will replace the timing belt for you which she agreed. I kept pestering them for the 300 point inspection report which they ignore for several weeks. This is when I started to have suspicion. They finally texted me an image of the supposed report which was stamped weeks after the car was already sold with zero comments on it. So I decided to run a carfax just to see if it would show the service record that the timing belt had been replaced. All it showed was an oil change, inspection, and cleaning done. I then called the service department and they confirmed that the timing belt had not been done and told me exactly what was done which matched with the carfax report. This was an official Toyota dealership so the services they provide gets uploaded to the database Carfax pools from. So I've emailed and call them, but I'm expecting them to avoid my emails and calls like the have done in the past. Do I have any legal standing? Thank you  If the dealership will not do what they agreed to do then you can have the service performed elsewhere and sue them in small claims court for the cost. Were you expecting me to say no? Do you have this promise to replace the timing belt in writing?
