 If I am stoped by an environmental health officer for throwing littler on the floor in the UK, am I legally obliged to provide my name... but then if I do not provide my name and police are called to the scene and I refuse to provide any details to the officer will I be arrested? If so what happens if I just never tell them any information about myself? r/legaladviceuk or you could just not be an assay and stop littering
