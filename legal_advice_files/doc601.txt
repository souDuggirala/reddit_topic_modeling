 Washington state resident, no health insurance. Trying to find eligibility for different programs online, but the ones I’m looking at say 19 y/o or older. What are the steps I should be taking to get on insurance? Everything I was looking at for the 18 as a child required info from parents— the individual this is for has been excommunicated from their family and is fully independent  IANAL but work in healthcare on the financial and insurance side. Have you tried your state's Medicaid agency? If other plans say they are 19 and up, it sounds like Medicaid covers children through age 18 (as is typical). The downside to that is they may have to consider your parents income for eligibility purposes. However, if you live completely independent of your parents, it might be worth calling and talking to them about any options they may offer.
