 If you want further details please look at my entitled parents post, but basically a kid over for a birthday party had a spasm and cut of the top of my brothers finger off. The finger was sewn on and he is recovering, however we want to take legal action and were wondering if we could and how much it would cost and how much punishment would they get. Thank you.  Isn't that your fake story you were talking about  I don't see any legal action here. This happened at your brother's party at your house so presumably your parents were meant to be supervising the kids. It also seems like a major error by your family that there were apparently multiple large knives lying around a cake and a group of hyped up 7 year olds.  You could try to recoup any out of pocket medical expenses, but it’s not a sure thing that you will be successful. If the kid was over at your house then someone might say that your parents should have supervised them better so this didn’t happen. You can’t sue a 7 year old. You (well, not you, your parents) can take the parents to small claims court to recoup any out of pocket expenses. No one is getting a cash payout for leaving knives around children. There is not going to be any “punishment” since you were pretty clear it was an accident. What are the damages insurance hasn’t paid? When did this happen? What sort of legal action do you want to take? What kind of legal action? Do you want reimbursement for medical bills? What are you looking for?
