 I live in texas and am going to move to Omaha Nebraska. I signed a 6 month contract with LA fitness personal training back in November. There are no LA fitness clubs in Omaha, so I asked to cancel my account but they asked me to pay 50% of the remainder of the term. They also said something about(I don’t remember clearly) according to Texas law they don’t have to consider the relocation and I have to buy out my contract. I found online that if i just put a dead card on the account they cant charge me and some people have used this way to get out of LA fitness contract without having to pay the 50% remainder fee. Is it safe to do that, will me credit score be affected by this. Will this end up on my credit report? Does anyone know exactly what they meant by the Texas law thing?
