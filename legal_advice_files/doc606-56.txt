It started the day I told her I've been starting a new relationship with my neighbor. (hopefully. Wish me luck) 
And ever since,  my mom is missing calls, missing texts, because they are being forwarded to my insane ex girlfriend. 
She's been blaming me for it,  but I care so little, why would I do this? I haven't been. It's pointless and stupid. I believe it's something on her end she's doing.  Not a legal issue. Removed.  [removed] Has your mom called the phone company to find out how to fix this? Not legal advice, personal attack  [removed]
