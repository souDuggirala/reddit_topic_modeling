 Good evening, Reddit! Here in Florida we have a lovely interstate which loves to go from 60 to 0 every couple minutes. Unfortunately, I failed to stop, rear ended someone, pushed a large amount of cars together, and caused a considerable amount of damage to a lot of very nice new vehicles. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but soon after the accident I discovered my insurance only covers the legal minimum in property damage. From my understanding, i'm responsible for the difference. There's no way i'm able to pay this, unless I win the lottery. What are my options? I don't have a job (i've been actively searching) and i'm still considered a dependent, so I don't think I can file bankruptcy without it affecting my family. What can I do that'd have the least impact on my family (and people involved)? Thanks, Reddit! You're going to be responsible to pay the difference between actual damages and your insurance. If you don't have the money you'll just have to wait to get sued. Do you live with your parents? Was it there car? You may want to see if they have some kind of umbrella policy that might cover you.  You can wait until the dust has settled to see how much you're on the hook for then talk to a bankruptcy attorney.
