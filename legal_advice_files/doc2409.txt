 Recently I learned insider information about a company within the financial services industry. Due to the subject matter and my position in learning this information, I have decided to not trade this company's securities. What I am wondering is whether I can or cannot trade any financial services securities at all now. I am extremely confident that such information, when made public, will have a large impact on just about every other company within this sector. I was already going to enter my positions before I learned this information, but now I need to know if doing so would still constitute insider trading. Trading on the basis of material, non-public information is all it takes. It doesn't matter whether it's about your own company, about a competitor, or about a company in another industry entirely. If you're concerned that your trades may be viewed in light of the material and non-public information you recently learned, either speak to an attorney, or hold off until that information becomes public. It's legal to watch the news like a hawk and trade on it the instant it becomes public.
