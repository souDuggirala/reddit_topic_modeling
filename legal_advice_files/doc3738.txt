 The place was very dirty and my wife and I had to spend an unreasonable amount of time and effort to clean the apartment. Egregious examples include -mold on the shower curtain hanger -food on the floor (including peanuts, a common allergy) -a black grainy substance filling the bathroom sink -another white stained substance in the kitchen sink, -broken deadbolt -excessive food and items in the couch and chair, including a used Q tip Clearly it was in a poor condition and we had been told that the apartment would be cleaned before move in. Just dealt with some of this. 55-225.3 would be a good area for you. You could file for a judgment if they refuse to give the deposit back. Especially the mold issue  No, you cannot. You could have asked to have it professionally cleaned beforehand and it would have been up to the landlord to agree or not. The point of a deposit is to protect the landlord in case when you leave there is damage that needs to be covered. It would have been a good idea to take pictures of the place when you moved in to serve as proof of the condition for when you move out.  Did you take pictures and report it to your LL? Did you document everything? No you don't get your deposit back. But if you documented it then they cannot keep part of your deposit for cleaning when you leave
