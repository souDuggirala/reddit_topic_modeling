 Hey all. I’m not sure if this would be the right sub but here it goes. As the title says, the apartment foundation is sinking and there are visible cracks in the walls and ceiling. It looks like the apartment wasn’t fixed up well from the beginning. There are cracks at the drywall seams. If I rolled a bunch of marbles in the living room, they would all roll in to one corner. There’s a two inch difference on the floor in a span of maybe two feet. The apartment complex barely takes care of maintenance as is. They have to come in to my apartment to spray for ants and bugs every month and there’s been no improvement. The apartment was not taken care of before I moved in. The wood floors have large cracks and gaps. I pay $1400+ for a one bedroom in NJ. It is not some high end apartment. It’s pretty standard for this area. The owners don’t care that their foundation is sinking. I’m in one of their 13 or so buildings. Is there something I can do about this whether it’s reporting it for inspection or whatever may be
