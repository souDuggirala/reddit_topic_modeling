 My dad gave me 2 choices either get a used car from a dealership or purchase a car for my mom and give me his 2015 SUV and he takes her old car if I can get a good deal on the new car so I did got a big discount on it and we bought it on Oct 2018 now it’s Feb 2019 and he won't honor our deal and while we talked i told him to sign a contract but he said an oral contract was good enough. What can I do to get the vehicle Google promissory estoppel and Ohio. Why not just keep the car you bought?  You don't have any practical recourse. You can start saving up and buy your own car if you like.  Wait until you're 18 and purchase your own vehicle. You're a minor. Unfortunately any contracts with minors are generally invalid. Also as your parent your father can generally do as he pleases in your interests. So what can I do  I’m 17. He paid for my moms new car but he said if I found a good price around 25-28k and less than 30k mikes for a 2016 Honda Odyssey he would give me the suv and he would take my moms old car  How old are you? Am I understanding correctly that you paid for your mom's new car?
