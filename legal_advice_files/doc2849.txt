 My sister just casually mentioned she had a gun pulled on her at a red light last night. Our town is pretty safe, so this is scary to me. She said she was “playing Rock Paper Scissors” at a red light with a man, and then he pulled a gun out, and she drove away. She didn’t report it to the police. Should I call and report this? All she could tell me was that it was a Hispanic man in a blue Miata. Is that enough information or will calling not do any good? In Tennessee.  We can't give you better answers than those you'll get by directly contacting the police on a the nonemergency number.
