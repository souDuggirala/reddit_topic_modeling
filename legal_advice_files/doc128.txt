 In 2008 I had a TV break. I had bought the warranty for it and so it was replaced with another tv. There was a ~300$ difference which was put onto a "Leon's Preferred Customer Card." It's been sitting in a box forever, and so I called them up to see exactly how much was on it. The company that answered is called "Fairstone" and they told me they no longer deal with Leon's. I called Leon's and they told me that it is Fairstone that would be accountable for my money. It seems that neither party wants to take responsibility for what is owed to me. Can store credit vanish like this? Who should I appeal to to resolve this issue if both parties continue to deny their obligation to me? (I'm in Canada) Damn, for real? I was under the assumption that it was equivalent to legal tender. After 11 years you’re likely out of luck. You’d have to have the fine print of the contract related to the store credit. A lot of those reward/credits expire and say so in the legalese. It's legal for gift cards to have fees and expiration dates. Canada may be different but I don't think you have many options since it's your fault for waiting 11 years to try to use your credit.
