 Company has me on light duty in where they give me limited duties inside of our warehouse. They're having me go to urgent care on my own time (clocking out and clocking in), and they mentioned workmans comp but didn't offer it. Not that I don't like the company I work for, I just feel like they're not telling me my full range of options. Is there anything else I can do or ask for?  If the company you work for is self-insured, yes, collect any and all bills that you incurred due to the injury and bring them to your manager or HR and start the process of a claim. Yeah thats where it gets interesting. After telling my manager (good guy, just not very smart), I asked him where I should go, and if it's okay to go to the ER. He said that or urgent care. So I went to the ER and they checked me out and it went well, but they sent me home with meds that I had to pay for out of pocket, and im expecting the bill from them in the mail. When I get these bills, I'm assuming I give this to my manager? If you've injured yourself on the job and have outstanding medical bills or are unable to work and are missing wages, you can claim workman's comp. If you aren't missing time at work because they've moved you to light duty, and you don't have any medical bills to pay, I'd hold off until you know the extent of the injury after going to the doctor. Make sure you document everything, ask for any communication on the matter to be in writing. If there were any witnesses I would make sure they corroborate what happened. Simply hurting doesn't really qualify as damages for workman's comp unless you can tie it to some sort of monetary loss.
