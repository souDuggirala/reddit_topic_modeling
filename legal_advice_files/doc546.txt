 Hi everyone, I’m hoping someone can help me with a question I have. My ex got custudy of our son, unfortunately, and I’m regulated to visits here and there, at her discretion. If she wants to get up and move halfway across the world with my boy, she’s free to do that and it’s totally legal. Long story short: that’s devastating to me, but there’s not much I can do about it — except for one possibility that just fell into my lap. A former coworker of hers filled me in on some info about her: while she claimed she switched jobs due to choice a few months ago, what actually happened was that she threatened physical violence against one of the women she worked with, that woman went to HR, HR launched an investigation, and she was let go. My immediate fantasy, of course, was that I could get a legal team to look into this (it’s all documented by HR, and on record), and perhaps use her volatility and disregard for basic decorum as a way of perhaps getting custody of my son and getting him taken away from her. I don’t even think this is vindictive — if she’s losing jobs because she’s acting like a wild person at work, can’t I make the case that she’s liable to do it at home too? My son is 4, by the way. Thank you very much for any help here. Appreciate the quick response. Thank you You could try that argument, the odds of it working are slim to none. Particularly if you try without an attorney. Cases where a parent is relegated to visits at the discretion of the other parent are exceedingly rare. As I once had a judge tell a client “axe murderers get alternating weekends so long as they are not threatening the child.” This tells me there is much more going on here. As custody determinations are inherently fact specific with the ultimate standard of “the best interest of the child” you would need to talk to a local attorney about this.
