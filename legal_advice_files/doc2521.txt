 So, the summary: I had been living as common law with my partner for 5 years. I was not on the lease, his mother and my ex-partner were. Around 4 months ago, we were given an eviction notice for rent not paid, I went to the board hearing (being common law and not on the lease) and was able to deal with that matter legally and have it settled. There was a DV situation on Monday. The door to the apartment had to be broken down in order to get my child out. I have a restraining order in place and was told to not return to the apartment until ex had seen a judge and got a bail hearing. On Tuesday, his mother (who is on the lease) was contacted by the landlord and he stated that we were being evicted, had to pay for the door, since ex was locked up but “I was living there illegally” I had to pay the last months rent and everything be moved out in 30 days. He not-so-vaguely threatened Mothers job in his request. We had to sign papers in agreement to this. Ex has been released and separately we have done research. I have been paying rent and I can prove it is coming from my account. I find it fishy that I have to pay on this date when he stated 30 days from the signed form (which would have been this date). The landlord delivered Mother proper documents 3 hours before we were supposed to meet him, and he slid papers under the door (he says) Thursday morning. The date on the papers and the date of 30 days he said do not match. As of now, we have refused to sign anything until we learn what rights as tenants we have legally, and the landlord has switched from nice to mean. Note: The rent problem was with our old owners, this current problem has been with a new owner. Note: We stated (mother and I) that we have been under duress at this time and we’re not refusing the eviction, we just want to know our rights. This is based in Toronto, if anybody has dealt with this, are we proceeding correctly?
