 I have a pair of toxic cousins that I’m trying to cut out of my life permanently. They are both pretty shitty and entitled people, and they very clearly have no respect for me and my boundaries. Because we grew up together, they really know how to push my buttons, and it’s just not healthy for me to have them in my life. I’ve blocked them on social media, phone contact, and email. They obviously have all my info, and can use family as intermediaries, so this isn’t a super secure firewall. I would like to tell them that if I ever hear from them again I’ll tell their wives the truth that they both fucked prostitutes during one of their bachelor parties. Is this blackmail? I’m in WI, they’re in NY. Thank you. I figured as much.  [It is a class H felony]() in Wisconsin to do what you are threatening to do.  Thought so, thanks. Yes, that's extortion.
