 Hi, I am listed as an Annuitant on a policy. The Owner passed away 15yrs ago. When I call, the company indicates there is no Beneficiary listed on the policy and the deceased's Estate must claim distribute the funds. Executor of Estate has passed away and Re-opening the estate will cause a big scene. If possible, Do I have any rights as Annuitant to simply review the account/policy/contract / anything? Thanks for your help. It likely falls to state unclaimed property and eventually goes to the state. Thank you. What happens if it's just left there and then I die? Is the money forfeited to the company or something? No, you were told what was needed to be done due to the executor's failure.
