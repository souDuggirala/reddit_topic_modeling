 I am designing a marching band show and am using music that Viacom owns. I have reached out however they have just taken my name number and what I want to use it for. I of course am willing to pay for the license, won't be making money off of it, and can list a book of benefits for the kids that will get to use if Viacom would let us use it. Thanks for your help! You didn't state a question. Wait for them to get back to you.
