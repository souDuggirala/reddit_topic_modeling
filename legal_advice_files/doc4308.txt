 [You can view the previous post here]() Hi legal advice, I wanted to thank you all for your kind words and help with this matter. I e-mailed HR the following day (Black Friday) and did not get a response until the following Wednesday. HR forwarded my e-mail to benefits whom informed me I could qualify for intermittent FMLA leave, which is unpaid. I e-mailed them back and sent some clarification that I wasn't looking for unpaid leave but simply an accommodation. Benefits sent my e-mail back to HR. HR called me when I was on the clock to clarify exactly what it is I was looking for (just a heater that had to stay up front since the nurses like to take the two we have in the building). She informed me she would forward my email to the Executive VP of Operations as she handled those matters. On Friday she e-mailed me asking when I was available to talk. I told her I would be available tomorrow as I wanted to speak when I was home and not in office surrounded by my co-workers. She e-mailed me back today to clarify that all I was looking for was a space heater to stay in my area and said she immediately sent an e-mail to my manager to buy one before the week is out. She said she will follow-up with me at the end of this week to ensure that it is done. She stated she will not disclose anything about my health to them, but just that is an accommodation. To the redditor that suggested I may have Raynaud's. I have looked into it and scheduled an appointment with my primary care doctor for next week. Thank you all again for your advice and help!!!
