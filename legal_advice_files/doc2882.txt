 I am from northern California. My wife was having an affair with her supervisor from work. I caught her by remotely initiating her phone to begin recording from the microphone. I called her out on it and she said it would never happen again. At work she told her boss she wouldn't do anything with him again and he says if she doesn't come see him he will fire her. She made a written complaint to HR and they said the would investigate it. After a month of unpaid leave they called to say they are firing her because of the complaint she made. What do we do? [removed] Pretty sure you don't have all of these details right, but if you can prove they fired her because of her complaint you're going to be rich. She should consult an employment attorney. What did her complaint to HR say? Reporting a consensual relationship was inappropriate. Her boss didn't do anything wrong unless he was offering her advancement based on their affair. You can speak to an employment attorney but I am not sure that the company acted in an illegal way. By the way, remotely activating her microphone was SUPER illegal.
