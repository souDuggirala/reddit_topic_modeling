 Hi, I am building a website referencing medics of all kind for the transgender community. According to GDPR, if Kevin H. enters the informations of : Dr. X, 3 boulevard of broken dreams, dermatologist. Has Dr. X the right to ask us to remove everything? Or is the owner of the data Kevin H.?  Kevin H is not the owner of the data. Who has the main responsibility depends on exactly who Kevin H is. If he is a third party data controller who hired you to use the data it would be his responsibility to make sure that you removed it. If you are the data controller the main responsibility is yours. So yeah, Dr X would have the right to ask you to remove the data. Though a data subject does not always have the right to have data erased even if they ask for it. In this case I would assume they would have the right, though.  You can legally publish people's addresses. That information does not "belong" to anyone.
