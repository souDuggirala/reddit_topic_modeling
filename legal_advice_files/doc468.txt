 Company based on CA. What are the laws regarding use of a company owned email address it the employee is terminated? Can the company simply forward any/all received messages to the replacement employee? I feel like this would be a privacy violation since the terminated employee might have personal/sensitive information connected to that account- but since the company owns it maybe that doesn’t matter?  Common sense says we have personal computers, tablets, cell phones. Numerous ways to do personal items while at or during work. Personal emails on a work computer is not very professional and leaves you open to an unknown number of people being able to see your business. Do you want your coworkers to know target has a sale? Now about Macy’s? Maybe that your amazon delivery has almost made it to your stop. Sound silly right? Your employer owns your emails and can do what they want. I’d prefer to leave a good impression and not one that I like to shop.  It is not personal anymore, company property. Should have know better. The employee shouldn't be using their corporate account for personal use. Many larger companies have IT policies employees sign for just that reason. (Smaller companies should, but often don't.) You can forward all emails to the new hire, or just close the account, as you prefer.  Don't use work email for personal stuff. They own it, terminated employees have 0 rights to it. No employee has any right to privacy on company owned email.   They shouldn't. It's not their personal e-mail address so they shouldn't keep personal things on it. Correct. They can access their corporate e-mail address anytime they want.
