 On probably about 5 occasions my ex has raped me. I have agreed to let him have sex with me in my sleep two times. Then he continued to do it 3 more times without my consent and then he has not stopped having sex with me when I say I don't want to have sex anymore. This happened twice. These incidents happened months ago and i feel like the police will do nothing about it. Yesterday he tried to force himself on me and I hit him and then he hit me and almost hit me again after that. We both called the police on each other he called the police on me because I cut his TV cord in half with scissors. I am on Friday, going to a family resource center to get a restraining order, which is great, but I feel like it's not a big enough justice. I don't think he should be free while I look bad because I cut his TV cord and filed the restraining order. I'm not sure what my options are on this, so that's why I keep asking for help here  Your post has been removed for the following reason(s): No Clear Legal Question Your post does not appear to contain a legal question - or if it does, it’s not clear what it is.
