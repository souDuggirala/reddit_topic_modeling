 Let's say my name is John Gary Smith. I'm starting an online LLC, but I don't want to use my legal name. The paperwork filed with the SOS has my legal name, of course, but I'm talking about my online presence. Instead of "John Smith", I want to use "John Gary" on all of my social media and my website. Is this legal to do? Yes it is legal. You may need to file an assumed name (DBA) with the state if you are doing business under that name.
