 So my apartment complex is claiming I paid my rent late, and are now trying to charge me a late fee plus the rent that apparently did not go through. I checked my bill pay and saw that it was delivered the 7th, and confirmed it over the phone with my bank. My rent was sent and cashed successfully last month, so there is no address issue here. From the looks of it, they just did not cash it in yet. Is there anything else I can do to fight this? I sent them screenshots as proof of delivery but they outright ignored it. I’m trying to call them but they are busy currently. I've never rented a place where the grace period was less than 10 days? I also live in MD tho so maybe it's a state thing. Most leases have a five-day grace period window. Ten days isn't impossible, but it's pretty uncommon. Are you 100% certain you have 10 days from the 1st day of the month to submit your rent without a late fee? Anywhere on the first 10 days of the month. I sent it Nov. 30 and it was delivered Dec. 7, so I’m within the range  When does your lease say rent is due?
