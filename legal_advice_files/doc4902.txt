  Hey everyone, I am planning to sell some fanart I made of pokemon, digimon etc...but I am really not sure if this is legal. I see alot of people on instagram selling their fanart so I guess it is ok? Or do I need a special permission? Is it in the US different than in germany? Is there any website that states all the rules? thanks for the replies! So if I understand correctly it is illegal to sell fanart. But still I am wondering why so many people just do it? well - yes and no. Big companies like Nintendo, the owners of pokemon, give out licenses for the distribution of their stuff in other nations, so that people actually in the nation they want to operate in handles this stuff. [Here are for example the information]() about pokemon-fanart in Germany [This]() is a good place to start. On a quick skim it's pretty evident the selling Pokemon fanart would be in breach of their copyright protections in each Berne Convention country, as Japan is party to that. so for example the pokemon company is founded in japan that means I have to know the japanese copyright system. I cant find any internet source on this matter.. INAL, but I am an artist: unlicensed fanart is still a derivative form of the original property which is almost always protected through copyright. Technically anyone selling fanart without explicit permission from the copyright holder is infringing and breaking the lawâ€”whether or not the copyright owner pursues legal action. Germany and the US are both part of the [Berne Convention]() which gives protection of copyright across borders using the terms legal in the country of origin. So, for example, if you do fanart of a property that's copyright registered in the United States but you live in Germany, you still have to abide by the US copyright law when dealing with that property.
