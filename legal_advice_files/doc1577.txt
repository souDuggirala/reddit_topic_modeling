 So my friend and I were talking about something, then I texted him about something that would be really cool to do, and then he made it without talking to me about it (I wanted it to be a group project). I'm not very experienced in this area, but who owns IP? Does anyone? I won't sue him or anything, but I'm curious, if he ends up making money off of this, does he owe me? Again, if he doesn't, I won't pursue this any further but I'm just wondering.  If there's computer code involved (not pseudocode, but actual code), then I think there's some copyright or other IP involved. No one has rights to an idea. Specific pieces of IP can be protected. If you just were sharing the idea together then there's probably nothing you can really do. If he used a patented, copyrighted, or trademarked piece of your IP then you might be able to claim infringement.
