 When I moved in, the roommate/landlord told myself and my father about outdoor cameras, for which there’s a sign on the front door. Odd conversation topics later, I believe roommate/landlord has a camera indoors. Sister tells me I’m losing the plot to paranoia. I agree with sister until roommate/landlord brings up conversation topics that happen with my meandering friend while she’s not home. Again, sister tells me to dismiss it, so I do. Friend of r/L comes overs and talks about living by herself. R/L cuts herself when talking about cameras. Very weird because R/L LOVES talking down to anyone whos not doing what she’s doing.friend asks where cameras are and r/l changes conversation. I straight up asked this woman if there were cameras in the house and she said no. Come to find out today she’s using a CO detector that isn’t really that..... What can I do legally?  Awesome, thanks! Anytime I post the the bot goes after me. At a true loss what to do. [removed] So you found a CO detector that's what, a camera and audio? Call the police. It might not be illegal to video in a common area, but it would probably be illegal to record audio.  IANAL, but you definitely need to get law enforcement involved. That's a very scary situation.  [removed] Hi! I have and I’ve reviewed the contract I’ve signed with roommate/landlord. I’m unsure of the privacy laws in CO which is why i came to this forum. I’d love to post the pictures of what I found online vs what’s in the house but I don’t have enough karma points?
