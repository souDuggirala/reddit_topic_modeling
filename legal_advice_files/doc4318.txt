 I am a disabled veteran who can’t work, I make cutting boards and things and have had my first 3 profitable months. I want to make it a legit business, employ only other disabled vets, and call it wounded warrior woodcrafts. Is this an infringement on the wounded warrior project trademark? Perhaps I could put a disclaimer “we are not affiliated with wounded warrior project” or something. Also, I’m an alumni of the wounded warrior project, they paid for my housing after I got blown up. So I don’t think they’d try to directly fuck me in court unless I was jntrntionally trying to deceive people. Thanks  They have no way of knowing what your intentions are, and using that name could certainly be interpreted as deceitful. You should either get their written permission to use it or come up with something else. Also, given [their history](), it seems very likely they would take legal action against you. Pick a new name to be safe. Try "Woodcraft Warriors" or "Woodwork Warriors" or "Warriors Coming Out of the Woodwork" or "Millwork Militia" or ... I'm having too much fun...I'll stop. Thanks for your service... "So I don’t think they’d try to directly fuck me in court unless I was jntrntionally trying to deceive people." It does seem deceitful to try to launch your business by using a variation of their name to the extend you'd have to use a disclaimer.  I would ask them directly. It could be a Trademark Infringement (imo it's pretty close) but they could just as easily say go for it. But by asking you'll know for sure if they're likely to make it an issue or not. Pick a new name. They are required to police their trademark or they could lose it. Or contact them and ask to license the mark.
