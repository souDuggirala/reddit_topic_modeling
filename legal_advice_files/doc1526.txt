 Say someone broke into a home and was stealing the TV off the wall when they accidentally witness a murder. In this case, what happens if they want to tell the cops what they saw? Can they get immunity first without saying anything first? Or is there no way to get immunity without risking it? And if you do get immunity, could that extend to the homeowner not being allowed to sue you? Or that's impossible to get immunity from?  So in other words, our system is so messed up you would probably say that if this was a poor burglar who can't afford a lawyer or to get sued, it would actually be best for him to just not report it?  You hire a criminal defense attorney who approaches law-enforcement on your behalf. You want /r/legaladviceofftopic  They should get a criminal defense attorney who can help them navigate cutting deals for testimony. The homeowner's ability to sue the burglary will depend on too many things for us to be able to guess at. Generally, criminal immunity deals don't extend to civil court.
