 In effort to help my friend to pursue legal action, what should her steps be? I've had the displeasure of confirming that she took photos of her arms. from what I know I think she needs to file a police report next. But I cannot advise her any further. Any information regarding this will be a god send. thank you  No they do not. shes safe now and has cut all contact  Filing a police report would be the appropriate way to handle this. She also needs to secure her safety. Do they live together?
