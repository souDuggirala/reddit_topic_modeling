 Hi, My parents (80+) were advised by agent to make investments for money markets maturing 2033 (yeah they will be dead). Long story short. I have power of attorney. got attorney and another advisor to work on filing complaint and then taking to FINRA. The attorney and other advisor are slow. In the interim my mother wants to make changes to these investments. She keeps calling me and I keep telling her I don't think it is wise to make changes knowing we are filing a complaint against this company. Question is this: Is it wise to be make any changes knowing a complaint is going to be filed? After we started down this path she moved money from one account to another so they mature one after the other so they can get their money. One matures in 2077...yes you read that right.  There is no such thing as a bond CD (at least legitimately). Who issued the instrument? How do you know the principal is dropping? Is it a traded instrument? Who is the issuer of the bond? And a bond and a CD are two very different things. You really need to nail down the terminology here. [deleted] You have a duty to mitigate damages if you plan to sue. It is unclear what exact investment type this is, but if you are able to take it out without penalty, you probably should. You can't pursue damages via a lawsuit later if you were able to fix the problem on your own. Edited for clarity. Your ability to recover damages would be limited.  Just trying to understand more. They are money market funds? And they are 100% illiquid until maturity (which will be after their death)? Or can they be redeemed or sold I'm confused as to what the money was invested in. Money market accounts are generally very short term, to the extent that some are practically demand accounts. CDs have longer terms, but nothing like you are describing. Are they life cycle mutual funds?
