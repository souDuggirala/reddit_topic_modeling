-No-fault wreck in Ky.
-Was backseat passenger
-Diagnosed sciatic nerve pain, herniated disc. 
-Lawyer is going after the insursnce of rhe driver of the vehicle I was in. 

I happen to have a list of what the insurance policy covers

Bodily Injury - 50k each person, 100k per accident
Unisured motorists 25k each person, 50k per accident. 

No fault reperation benefits - 10k limit


What do these mean? How much can I get? 

I also don't want to get screwed over by my lawyer so I am asking here. 


Also there is something called a pre settlement loan. Very interested in this as the bills are piling up and I am dead broke. Like can't afford toilet paper broke atm lol

I've done some researching but I've never been in a car wreck before. 
 Yes. Must have proof of injury/winnable case and you can get small amounts like 1k. Lawyer cannot directly loan but he will send you to someone who can Did you end up finding anything about the pre-settlement loan?? I hadnâ€™t heard of that before, very intrigued !
