 I custom painted a FunkoPop for Christmas for my boyfriend. I posted a photo on Twitter, and the creator of the character messaged me and asked me to make more for him to sell. I totally give him permission to and he’s giving me credit (and paying me)- but can I get in trouble with Funko? Can they sue me? This character is kind of indie/local/underground, so FunkoPop will probably not make their own version of him. Also, the fact that the owner/creator got into contact with me, it’s doubtful he has any plans with Funko themselves to make a “official” product. I’m more or less wondering if me selling a painted FunkoPop is legal.  If you’re reselling actual funko pops that’s you’ve altered and calling it your own product then yes, indeed you can be sued for that.
