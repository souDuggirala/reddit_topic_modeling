I was granted temporary sole legal and physical custody of my child 2 years ago. The judge verbally said temporary, which my lawyer stated usually meant a year. However, it doesn't say temporary on the final order and there is no time frame listed on any of my paperwork. 

If it hasn't been challenged by the other parent, do I still have sole legal and physical custody?  Thank you so much. We intend to visit a lawyer after the holidays. I appreciate your response.  Termination of parental rights is possible, but is expensive and requires a lawyer. I recommend adult adoption if possible because you can still get child support from the noncustodial parent, and it's much simpler. I am now married and my spouse wants to adopt said child. Do we need the permission of the non custodial parent?  Go ahead. I have a follow up if you don't mind and are a lawyer?  Yes.
