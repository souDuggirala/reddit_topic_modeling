 To put it simply, our landlord is requesting overdue rent after no correspondence with him for months despite living in his property. We signed the contract 2 years ago and since then I have asked for it multiple times to no avail, we were not sure how much we should have been paying, he would tell us over text message but without the contract we couldn't have known for sure. We also did not know which dates we were supposed to pay, and he'd message us at random times throughout the month saying we owe and that it was due a month ago! He also has left the house in disrepair for month with numerous reminders before he's come to fix it. What can I do? Always keep a copy of important contracts that you sign. If the landlord is stating that you are past due, ask for a complete accounting of payments as your records indicate otherwise. How is it possible that you are 'not sure how much we should be paying'? Surely you knew when you signed the contract, or can look at the amount of your previous payments.
