 I set this to civil matters in the flair but have no idea really what it’s about. I figured if it was criminal he’d be arrested on a warrant. This is the message is keep getting in voicemail: “This message is solely intended for Charles _⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠_ the force _⁠_⁠_⁠_ is Tiffany this is your final notification regarding your summons I will be out my _⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠_ _⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠_ at her current residence replace it employment stay between 3 and 5 PM if I can't reach you at eight or these locations I'll document this as a direct refusal to comply and you will miss your court date if you have any further questions or concerns you can contact the following Party's office directly at xxx-xxx-xxxx. “ What could this be about? Does anyone have any vague idea what this type of legal action is for? Thank you  Ok. Thank you!! I will Ok thank you. Good to know  This sounds like a scam. "Document this as a direct refusal to comply" is not a real thing and it's the kind of thing a scammer would say. I guess I should. I will. Edit: I just called again. It said the same thing and then, she can be contacted on her cell phone if it’s important, no number listed. Then a computerized voice comes on and says, “sorry, the user’s mailbox is full and cannot accept any more messages.” 🤷🏼‍♀️ Some people never answer their phone. Have you left a message? I did but I keep getting a recorded message saying she’s away from her desk.  Call them back and tell them they have the wrong number and mind your own business.
