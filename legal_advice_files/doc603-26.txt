Lemme start by saying i live in Ontario, Canada. So a few days ago I bought a heater from walmart. Been working fine and all. Today I went out to grab a coffee at Tim Horton's. When I got home I went to move my Xbox to the bedroom to play some games. That's when I noticed the heater plug had some black soot around its plug. I should mention the heater has been off since about 6pm yesterday. I figured crap it overheated and tried turning on the TV plugged in above it. It turns on fine. When I plugged my Xbox in however, I found that it wasn't working. Tried it in the living room and its working perfectly fine. Tried all of the input plugs on the TV and none of them work. I figure that whatever happened to the heater had some effect on the tv. What should I do in this situation?  You should still have renters insurance  You should repair or replace the TV. And plug it in to sone kind of surge protection in the future. 

If the failure was in the heater and not the outlet you should have it replaced by the vendor or manufacturer.  I live in an apartment building You do not need legal advice, you need an electrician.

You can try to activate your renter's insurance if you want to make a claim for the damaged materials.
