 Hello, so my aunt was a having a hard time and my family want to give her the grandfathers Winchester repeater. Long ago she was involved in something and became a felon. Everything else in her record is clean. I was just wondering if there is a way to maybe “disable” the firearm so she can legally have it? It doesn’t need to shoot, just a sentimental thing.  You need to find out if her civil rights have been restored. If they have, then she is permitted to possess a firearm.  This is somewhat gray territory, but ATF guidance is generally that the receiver (more on that below) needs to be destroyed, usually by two cuts with a metal saw or a plasma torch. In the case of what you're calling a Winchester repeater - which is typically an 1894 or 1892 or similar lever-action carbine - that would be the riveted piece of metal that contains the bolt, loading gate, and lockwork. Cutting it would effectively destroy the gun. Even when firearms are 'deactivated' (IE, drill rifles you see ROTC cadets toting - they usually have a piece of metal welded into the barrel and the lockwork removed), they still are, as far as the ATF is concerned, firearms. If it's been a while, you may wish to go about getting the felony expunged. Probably not without destroying it. Even if it’s rendered non-functional, the police probably won’t care if they find out she has it. Find another family heirloom to give her.
