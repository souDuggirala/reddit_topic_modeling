 I recently acquired a domain name via GoDaddy domain auction for a (formerly) popular niche clothing brand. The domain follows the format "shop{CompanyName}.com". The business was a registered LLC in Georgia (United States) as "{CompanyName} LLC" and was dissolved in September of 2018. {CompanyName} was never registered as a trademark. I want to establish a company in the same clothing niche in Pennsylvania as "{CompanyName} LLC" and use "shop{CompanyName}.com" for the website. So, I have a few questions for you, /r/legaladvice: 1. Am I in the clear to register the trademark {CompanyName}? 2. Am I in the clear to establish a new LLC with the same name, in the same niche, as the previous LLC has been disolved? 3. Am I in the clear to use shop{CompanyName}.com for the company's website? Thank you in advance, I'm happy to provide more context if necessary.
