 My stepfather filed a suit against the hospital that took care of my mom. Initially my stepfathers lawyer reached out to all of us siblings stating that he couldnt go through with it without our consent, at first we didnt know what to do. And before we could my stepdad had a private investigator issue us a letter stating that we our aware of the lawsuit and to sign the document. We didnt sign it and now it seems the lawsuit is going on without us. Originally his lawyer said hed represent us too but my stepdad has always resented us and all in all has been pretty evil to us children. We now cant get a response from his lawyer and feel like were being shut out. We have a meeting with a lawyer soon but to be more informed I thought id post here before the meeting so I can be as knowledgable on the subject as possible.
