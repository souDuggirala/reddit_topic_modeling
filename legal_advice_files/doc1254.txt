 Hello I was hoping to get some information on the good neighbour law in California. I live in San Diego county and own a home with a fence that is damaged. (Home inspector, fence contractor both recommended replacement. The fence doesn't even stand straight anymore due to termite damage) The problem is that my neighbour do not want to split the cost and I told him that I would take him to small claims court. (Side note: I have been communicating with the owner via property management company) After threatening to take them to small claims court, the property management company is now all of a sudden saying the owner lives abroad and cannot be reached. Is there a way to take the property management company to court and have them withhold the monthly payment or something? What other options are available? The owner is the responsible party. You'll end up having to get a lien on the property. It won't get you the money now but it will eventually.
