 We had a home built a couple of years ago and the documents specified an insulated garage. The garage doors are insulated and so are the walls but the ceiling was not. I did not notice this until just recently. Our home warranty was for one year. I have not called the builder about it yet but I'm 95% sure they will refuse to come insulate it now. It will cost me over $1000 to do it myself. Am I out of luck because we signed the final paperwork and bought the house? Is it reasonable to expect a homeowner to go look in the attic to see if it was insulated? Can they call the garage insulated when they have no intention of insulating the ceiling? Do I have grounds to strong arm the builder into insulating it at this point? Thanks for the recommendation. If the builder doesn't take care of it when I bring it up I will do that.  Call your local code inspector. My guess is that code will require the insulation. I pulled up the paperwork from the original bid and it says "Insulated and sheet rocked garage with fire tape finish". It doesn't specifically mention the attic but that sounds to me like it should be fully insulated. It's a normal garage with vertical walls and a flat truss ceiling above it. The garage isn't really insulated in my opinion if all of the heat can escape through the roof.  Did the contract say they were going to insulate just the garage or both the garage and the attic above it? Because it’s my understanding that insulating a room is just insulating the walls, with the walls of the attic being tilted they also make up the ceiling but other than this i have never heard of “ceiling insulation”.
