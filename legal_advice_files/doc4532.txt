 I bought a ~$4,000 call for the company I work for and just found out this is against policy. Is there anything actually illegal about what I did? Is it worth the trouble to report this and have to unwind the trade? Regardless of any legal problems I assume you know that you could (would) be fired for this.   Needless to say your company can discipline you for this event in accordance with their policies, your contract if you have one, or your collective bargaining agreement.  You could run afoul of SEC for insider trading, possible licensure issues (if that's relevant to you), etc. Hard to say based on the details given
