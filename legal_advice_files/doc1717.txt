 We are looking at buying a property and according to the survey we had done the neighbors "front yard" and a corner of their driveway is actually on the property we are looking at buying. Will they have an adverse possession claim if as the new owners we resurrect a fence on our property line? Adverse possession is abolished in BC, but they might have an easement (right to use). This is the sort of question that you want to discuss with a real estate lawyer BEFORE you make a final offer. You need to hire a lawyer to do the conveyance anyway, so may as well do that now.
