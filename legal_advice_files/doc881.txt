 So long story short I broke up with my boyfriend and we have a kid together. The court ordered that I have contact with him until a few more weeks. I have a few issues but a big one is that he is threatening to call the police that I have a friend over when my kid is around. The court stated that until things are settled I canâ€™t have any sexual partners around but my friend is nothing but that. The ex boyfriend is very jealous and manipulative and harasses me over the phone demanding what he wants me to do and how to live and what I can do. Is it legally possible for a court to not allow me to have a friend or even a family member in my own house just because my sons home Thank you!
