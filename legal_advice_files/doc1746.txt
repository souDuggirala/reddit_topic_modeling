 USA California. Coworker and close friend asked if I want to be a manager (I can't say the actual word, it's banned I guess) of a subreddit he "manages", about 1 million subs, and I think it is something I would like to try. However they have a agreement thing and one of the agreements is you have to be willing to "moderate questionable or obscene content" this concerns me because I don't want to get into hot water if I have to moderate something that might not be legal. What is the law on stuff like this? Some of the stuff just breaks the subreddit rules. What I'm worried about is dealing with content of questionable legality. Not expecting that to happen, it's not a porn subreddit, but there are a fair amount of photos involving drugs and occasionally naked people.  Isn't moderating just deleting questionable posts?
