 I was just going to grab 20$ and go to the bathroom when the ATM in front of me had 200$ sticking out. I looked around, no one was really around except one guy who was leaving. So I took the money, went outside, felt bad and then went back inside to see if anyone would say something or looked like they were missing money. There were two... People who may have been security guards for a other part of the building outside. I'm not really sure. They didn't approach me and there were no tellers around. So then I left with the money and gave $20 to homeless people on my Transit home. Should I turn the rest of the money in or can I keep it? I didn't end up using my bank card at all. Banks have a million cameras. You should have asked for them to look it up, since there would also likely be account information in the ATM from whoever pulled the money.  You should assume - because it's almost certainly true - that you were caught on multiple cameras, and proceed accordingly. Assuming the ATM was next to a branch for that bank, the correct approach would have been to take the money and immediately give it to a teller inside the branch. You should turn it over to the police. If no one claims it, you should be able to keep it after a certain amount of time.
