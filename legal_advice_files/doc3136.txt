 I'm interested in lock picking as a hobby, but I'm unsure about whether possessing lock picks would break the law. I found a quote on a blog about the "murtov√§lineen hallussapito" law that states you need an "acceptable reason" for owning the lock picks, otherwise you're guilty of possessing a burglary tool. I'm looking to find out whether the info was legitimate, if there are other relevant laws i should know about, and whether my interest in picking locks for fun qualifies as an acceptable reason.  [Link to Finlex](%5Btype%5D=pika search%5Bpika%5D=rikoslaki%2011%20luku%208%20%C2%A7#highlight858) Yes, it's illegal to possess one without an acceptable reason. You'll get fined. Ei Thank you for the link! IANAL but that reason might be connected to having locksmith license or working as someone who has a valid reason for it. It might be also up to court whether "hobby" is valid reason. You might want to check references here http://lockwiki.com/index.php/Legal_issues
