 A few months ago i got robbed during a craigslist meetup. The robber contacted me through text and I dont have his number anymore. The cops contacted me again today after submitting the report a few months ago. The cop asked me to look for the messages and his phone number, and they asked me to come in to look at photos of some suspects. I said ill try to find them and if i find it ill text it over. He replies “no its okay, you dont have to text it to me when you get here i have a device that can scan your phone”. This got me super uncomfortable. We have an appointment today to meet and i dont feel comfortable at all with having the police scan my phone. Any advice? Also, during this meetup am i allowed to leave at any time? Big scammer Scammer one thing you should clarify is the jargon "scan your phone" it probably is what you fear, which is a device that will clone all the data on your phone, but it could be something as simple as a device that grabs screen shots in a way that makes them easily admissible evidence. you should ask. and you could always just delete everything off the phone except the info they need. its up to you. if it were me, i would cooperate with suspect identification and offer to show them the specific message, but not allow any "device" to be connected to my phone. They would need a warrant to compel you to have your device searched. So you could refuse. Keep in mind that doing so could leave them with insufficient evidence to move forward against the robber. Then say no. They likely wont be able to help with your case as well without all the info.
