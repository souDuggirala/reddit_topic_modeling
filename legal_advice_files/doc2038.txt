 I received a jury summons for the Rene C. Davidson Courthouse within the Alameda court district. However, the ejuror online asks me for the last 3 letters of my last name and my last name is only 2 letters long. As a result, it keeps telling me my information is incorrect and I am unable to sign in. After some Googling, I discovered that other courts have paper forms to fill out if your last name is 3 letters long but I can't find anything on what to do for the Alameda court district. The forms on the website are don't seem relevant to my issue. My parents and I received our American citizenships relatively recently so they have not had to deal with a jury summons yet and are unable to figure out the issue. I have sent the courts an email but it has been 2 days without a response and the 10 day deadline to fill out the juror questionnaire is coming up soon. Any help would be appreciated (especially links to relevant forms). Thanks. In reality you most likely will not face any consequences for ignoring a jury summons so I wouldn't sweat it too much. They're not sent registered mail. It is your civic duty and a good experience to see how the court system works so I suggest contacting the court and make an effort to serve. Thanks I'll definitely do that if I can't figure it out by tonight Call them tomorrow and ask them. (510)891-6031
