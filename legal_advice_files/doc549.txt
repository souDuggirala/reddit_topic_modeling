 My sibling has asked me to act as their surety. I had never come across this term before and have been doing some research. As I understand it I would be taking responsibility for them, ensuring they act in accordance with whatever limitations the judge places on them and making sure they show up to court. If they don't show, or if they break any laws, then I could be expected to pay an amount of money to the court. It sounds like the exact details of this agreement are largely up to the judge's discretion, and so obviously I would want to get those details first. My question is: Other than being forced to make a payment, how else could this negatively effect me? It sounds like a rather simple set-up, but I'm sure there's more to it than what I've found so far. I am located in Canada, if that makes any difference. Any and all legal advice is appreciated.  I mean, do you want to be on the hook for your sibling's potential non-payment of a debt or violation of a court order? (I wouldn't.)
