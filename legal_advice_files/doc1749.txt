 Reference: =jqu8y04o sh=e9c594ae I'm currently filling out my county's Justice of the Peace small claims information sheet and need help with the part that I have to describe why I'm suing for the amount I am. How detailed do I need to be? Is it formal in the way that I should avoid him, her, she, my, I ? Do I need to address the defendant by last name (after I say the full name) I wish I could just post what I plan on writing, but that's way too personal. I feel that it's not too bad, but she works in a law firm so I want to cover all my bases. Is there anywhere online that has some good examples I could go off of?
