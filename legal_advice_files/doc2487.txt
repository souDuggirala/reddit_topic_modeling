 Hi all, I got caught with weed at college but all I had was 2/3 grams. The officer gave me a ticket but stated the wrong day. Can I fight it or what are my options? Iâ€™m in Connecticut.  Okay, thank you for your swift replies and help. Appreciate you guiding me through the process. Have a great day ðŸ˜Š None of that matters. Just tell the court you'd like to pay the ticket. And pay the ticket. The date was the wrong month. I had possession, yes, but it was the wrong date that was written down. Also I didnâ€™t have the money at the time and didnâ€™t agree with the marajuana law naively. We live in an oligarchy controlled by corporations but shits getting fixed soon.  Okay, so thereâ€™s no way to bypass it. I mailed it in saying proclaiming that I was not guilty and they sent me a letter to state my reason for not admitting guilt, any way to go back on my word and just pay the ticket?  Can you fight what? As you have readily admitted to possessing the weed, it is unlikely you will convince a judge that you in fact did not possess the weed. That the officer put the wrong date on the ticket does not change the validity of the ticket.
