 Wasn't exactly sure what sub to ask this in, but I figured here seemed apt. I put an application in for a place that was advertised on Zillow, Trulia, and Rently for $850 a month. After I had already paid and submitted it, the rent then went up to $895, and then finally $950. If approved for this property, do I have a leg to stand on to have them give it to me for the originally advertised price? Or would I have to take or leave the newly updated rate? Thanks. Careless typo. I'll fix.  't force them to rent to you at a higher rate What? OP is asking if they can demand the initial lower rate posted on the website.  You can't force them to rent to you at a higher rate, but if you put down a deposit you should get it back.
