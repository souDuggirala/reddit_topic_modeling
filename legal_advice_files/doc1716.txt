 Got into a car accident, it was minor just few scratches on both cars. It was 100 percent my fault so we decided to not call the cops since it wasn’t that big of a deal and I would pay for his repairs. I suggested 300 dollars, he agreed to it. What’s the safest way for me to give him the money? He has all my info, license, license plate and pictures of the accident (so do I.) would giving him a check enough to protect me from him potentially calling the cops and suggesting I never payed? What should I do?  I would get it notarized for a release of all claims against you for the accident that occurred when, where, releases anyone on your policy not just you, and clearly states what your paying and agreed to. So if they come back to you or your insurance carrier it’s easier to defend. Make sure to pay with something with a paper trail  I mean I would have him sign a paper and take a picture of it next to his identification . Do this. You never know what could come up over the next few weeks. You don’t want to find yourself deeper in a hole.  Depending on the state you could right the release form on your own if you know the wording, like in ohio any paper with an agreement and signature is binding  Not a Lawyer. Consult with a Lawyer, they can write up a release of liability with the terms you have agreed to. You both sign, you provide payment, everyone gets copies, maybe bring a notary in for the signature if you want to be really sure, then you move on. This will cost a little extra, but it'll give you relatively solid legal protection. I’ve seen some sample letters that I could print online, is that safe enough or would I have to go and talk to a notary?  Notary ?
