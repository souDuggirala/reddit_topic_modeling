 Without going into all the gory (IMO) details after getting an decision referencing a person that didn't even sound like me, I've learned that my atty did not send in updated records before my hearing or even After when given Two opportunities to do so! Now record is closed and I have to appeal to appeals council (another year of waiting) ðŸ˜­ Shouldn't he have sent them? How should I approach him?  Thank you. That's too bad. :( I just dont understand how he didn't know or care to update. He used to be a very good attorney.  Then yes, it's time to talk to a new attorney ASAP You didn't answer my question: Was your attorney specifically asked by the court to provide new records? And did your attorney know about your additional surgeries or whatever other gaps existed in those records? So the court specifically requested them? And your attorney just didn't submit them after multiple requests from the court and hasn't told you why? If that's the case, that's......not good. You may want to talk to a new attorney to get a 2nd opinion Hello. I put my answer in comments it looks like. Sorry. I want to add judge left record open. Was aggravated at hearing for not having some records. Even went so far as to add in Order that he had "...two opportunities to send in additional records,". ."...Claimant did not meet her burden of proof," [removed] We're going to need a little more gory detail to give an answer. You had a disability claim with SSI and hired an attorney. What records did he send or not send, why do you think he needed to send updated versions, did he have access to those records, and what did sending the records have to do with the outcome?
