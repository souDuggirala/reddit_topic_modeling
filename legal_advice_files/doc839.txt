 Four (or more) years ago my brother stole personal documents and letters from my deceased father from my mother. I say "stole" because he took them without my mother's knowledge or consent. I only found out about these documents about a year ago because he accidentally left a letter (addressed to him and myself) in a folder I lent him. Before that, my mother and then himself kept it secret. My brother then told me that he had a whole bundle at his house and he would give them to me once I finished university later that year (my father's death was deeply traumatic and he "didn't want to set off my anxiety"). However, once I finished and asked for them he would tell me "they're packed away somewhere" and "he would find them when he's free". I asked him for them at least three times over the next few months but to no avail. We have since fallen out and he still refuses to let me borrow them or give me a scanned copy. Due to his nature and the nature of our falling out, I believe he is doing this to spite me. He knows how much I want to know about our father, and how painful this is for me. I think it's only fair that I'm allowed to read them too. Despite my many attempts to politely asked for them, he refuses. What should I do?
