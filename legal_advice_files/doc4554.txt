 The original post can be seen here =JP1GDSPY sh=00d25493 Hi all I lost the login to my old account, I’m back with more questions. First off the union rep won’t help because it wasn’t on company property. Secondly I went to the dmv today, because I was sick of waiting. They allowed me to take the tests (air brake, general knowledge, and combination) which I passed all three. I went to pay for my permit this is where they said I am unable to get the permit because I haven’t been to court yet. It’s been 74 days and I still have not received a date. They said they mailed it on 11/22/18 which I found weird because that’s thanks giving. But I keep trying to call the department of feild investigations, but they are only open from 8-12 I called 9 times today, and probably 50-60 times in the past 75 days. Every time I get “all representatives are busy good bye” then it hangs up. I’m pressed for time because I need my cdl A class in a certain amount of time. Plus if I lose this job I lose my benefits which are keeping me alive right now, I get treatment every 4 weeks for severe Crohn’s disease with out insurance the treatment is $24,000 per time. I can’t afford an Lawyer. Any advice is appreciated thank you guys so much  Not a lawyer. Your union rep can't help you with the DMV, but would they be able to help you explain the situation to your employer? Maybe request an extension? Also, is the get a CDL deadline a company policy? An agreement between your union and company / industry representatives? A legal requirement? Your best approach is likely to be different based on exactly who is requiring this. Your union rep will likely know the answer to those questions, and - even if they can't get directly involved - could probably give you useful advice.
