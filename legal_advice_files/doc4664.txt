 Hey! I just need to know if taking my old landlord to court is even close to a good idea. I used to live in am apartment complex (we will call them KCA) that had a ton of problems. To name a few: Broken A/C Broken oven Cabinets that didn't close flooded laundry room Electricity bills no lower that $250 a month After 2.5 years my wife and I decided it was time to find a new place. Coincidentally, at the same time I got a new job in a new state so I discussed moving out with my landlord without a termination fee for how poorly our apartment had been run. She agreed, and I put it in writing that night and sent it of to her. I received no response from her, but thought nothing of it. Fast forward, I get my check for my security deposit back, but I still get charged for lease termination. I contact KCA and they either ignore my calls or email me back saying something along the lines of "read the lease" or "I never said that." I have since started recording every interaction with them. I have attached the email KCA never responded to in hopes of giving more details. []() TL;DR - Landlord said I wouldn't be charged for leaving apartment, but charged me anyways.
