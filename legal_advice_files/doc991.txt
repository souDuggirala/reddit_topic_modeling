 I play disc golf a lot, and have a floodplain behind my house that can't be built on on. I own several disc golf baskets, 9 to be exact, for a course. The floodplain belongs to the neighborhood, and I asked my neighbors if they were ok with me putting the baskets there. They said yes. However, one of there children knocked over and damaged a basket. They are expensiveness. I asked if they would compensate me. They refused, and threatened to tell the neighborhood owner that they wanted my baskets gone so I couldn't play. What all can I sue for and how should I keep the baskets in my backyard? Fiddlesticks Since it's not your property, $0. You assume the risk when leaving property out in the public.
