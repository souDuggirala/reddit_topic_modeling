 Additional information: I've been working with this company for five years I'm on the safety committee and have previously brought this to their attention I've confirmed that other branches have installed ventilation systems. The cut slices through the hydraulic hose (composed of a rubber coating covering up between 2 and 5 layers of wire. Enough smoke/haze emits from the cut to warrant blowing each hose out to eliminate the risk of contaminating the hydraulic system. Please let me know if any additional information is required. Thanks!
