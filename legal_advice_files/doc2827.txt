 Michigan - I'm assuming this is definitely fraud. Basically the client is an egomaniac and was not a fan when my partner began working with more and more people in the same industry as said client. This resulted in a heated exchange and severed ties. I have never met this client and never interacted with them. Could I work with this client as an individual (me, not the company) and have him pay me (not the company) without it being fraud? Granted I would have to conceal from him the fact that I am apart of the company. Some of the work done, might even be completed in office by members of the company, but he would only ever see me on location. All I care about is strictly legally speaking. I don't want to hear how stupid this is or I am, this is a thought experiment and I'm genuinely curious.  It won't be fraud unless you lie to someone.
