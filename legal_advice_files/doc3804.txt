 Also, - Am I legally entitled to ask them for a letter indicating I do this work for them? I am not an employee for them, but the agreement calls me an "Independent Contractor". But the company refuses to give such a letter. - I get paid monthly (an amount based on work done the previous month) and obtain the money through PayPal. I get an email stating I received money from that company. So no official paystubs but somewhat of a proof I do some work for them. - I have several emails from the company which are indicative of me working in that role with them. I need these confirmation letters/ accepted agreement copies from the company for some personal stuff in my country. I am hoping there is some legal precedent that can allow me to convince the company to provide me with those.  Oh wow. Ok, thanks.  Hmmm that's disappointing to know. So agreements like these are not legally binding then that both parties need to have a copy of them?  Of course you can legally ask. If they won't, there isn't anything you can do. There is no law that says "if you choose to do business with someone you must provide them a contract".
