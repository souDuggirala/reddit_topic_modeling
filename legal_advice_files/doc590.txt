 I worked at company X for 2 or 3 years. Everyone internally knows that the non-compete you have to sign to work there is probably not enforceable in court. However, no companies that work with company X are willing to hire employees of company X. Company X has a lot of control over the people that have access to their product, and importantly, the training material for their product. There is an understanding that if a company hires company X's employees, they can lose access to that product or training materials, which could be hugely detrimental to a large organization using the product. I've heard from people that recruiters they've talked to were told not to hire company X's people because of that non-compete. Since no company in the space cares to challenge the non-compete, I doubt it will ever be challenged. This seems crazy anti-competitive though, it's clearly there to lower how much company X has to pay experienced employees. Is this at all legal? NAL Unless there is active collaboration between the companies to blacklist you and interfere with your right to work, I don't see illegal activity. Nothing in your description suggests there is such collaboration. Perhaps the "understanding" you mention. But is that just rumor? Any actual evidence of this? Based on what you wrote, it just seems that the other employers are aware Company X employees are subject to a non-compete. It is perfectly legit for a company to be risk averse and not hire people subject to a non-compete, whether enforceable or not. Hiring such people puts them at risk of getting sued and having the associated legal costs.  Also possibly sounds like an anti-trust action waiting to happen. You could also report this to the [FTC](). Not if you're in CA. Call the states attorney office. Sounds like there is some illegal activity going on on a corporate level. Good luck.
