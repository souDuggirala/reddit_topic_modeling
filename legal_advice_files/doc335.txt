 A year ago, I was involved in an auto collision with a woman at an intersection. We had a collision, and I was cited being at fault for failure to yield and was issued a ticket. My car was severely damaged and had to be towed. The woman had cosmetic injuries to her car and was able to drive away. The ticket was dimissed in court a few weeks after the accident. About ten months later, my insurance calls me to tell me the woman is suing me for financial cossts of having to see a chiropractor and other "expenses" related to the accident, totaling a a third of my policy's coverage. My concern is, given the circumstances, does the fact that she was driving uninsured change the circumstances of culpability? I have gottn non-answers from my insurance company and have yet to be contacted by the insurance lawer. I understand my responsibilities in this accident, but I find it difficult to belive that an uninsured driver can be involved in an accident and not raise any questions or consequences.  No, you were at fault in the accident. Her not having insurance isnâ€™t a factor. Her insured status, or lack of, has nothing to do with the fault of the accident. If you are at fault your insurance will still cover. If she had been at fault you would have to sue her personally.
