 Hi everyone, I live in Arkansas, and am reuniting with my service dog who lives in Florida, soon, to bring him back to Arkansas with me. What "Documentation" does the apartment complex have the right to ask for? It's my understanding that they can ask for "Something", but there is no such thing as a federal service dog registry - that'd be illegal. I have my last eye exam which clearly states my disability on it, and I trained my service dog myself as I am legally allowed to do. The owner of my apartment complex said I need a note from my physician and"papers" "proving" he's a service dog. [removed] This is the correct answer.  That's all you need then. Proof of disability and saying he's a service dog. I will have a record of his vaccinations. I have proof of my disability but no "proof" of training except his behavior. A landlord is permitted to require some sort of proof of disability as a condition of accommodation, and some sort of proof the animal in question is a trained service animal, though generally he cannot require certification  If this is a seeing-eye dog, like a "real" service dog, they're allowed to ask 2 questions: Is this dog trained to perform a task for you? What task is this dog trained to perform? None of the service dog registries are legitimate. I'm not sure if they're allowed to ask for the dog's medical records (shots). Keep in mind that service dogs are covered by both ADA and FHA regs.
