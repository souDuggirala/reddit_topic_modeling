 I have a small commercial office that I rent which is not adequately heated. Parts of the day the temperature drops down to anywhere from 59 to 64°. I have notified the property manager several times two is offering a space heater which I have to pay for the electricity and it is also really loud. I talk to people in my office face to face and can’t have a loud space heater I also don’t want to pay the electric bill for it. What’s the best course of action? I don’t want to move. I also learned previous tenant had same issue and the problem is isolated to my office everyone else Complains it’s too hot in theirs.
