I was told i was going to be takin to court... what ways to fight this  [removed] What does your lease say?  Usually leases have an early termination clause, like paying 2 months which is the time they would consider taking to rent the residence again. 

&amp;#x200B; Fight what?  You entered into an agreement to pay 12 months worth of rent to the landlord in the form of a lease. The lease will specify certain events that will allow you to break your lease, so read up on that. 

If you signed this lease and the landlord gave you notice to move without a legal reason, I’m sure you’d be upset and want to fight it.  That goes both ways. 

That’s the reason for contracts; to protect both parties.
