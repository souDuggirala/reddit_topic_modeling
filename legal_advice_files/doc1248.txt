 IANAL, also not sure if this is the right sub, but I happened to be skimming the text of US constitutional amendments, and upon arriving at the 24th amendment I noticed what seemed like a contradiction with my current understanding of voting laws in many US states. For reference, the 24th amendment is as follows (emphasis my own): or other tax. However, [many states hold laws that prohibit felons from voting](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights.aspx), either while on probation or indefinitely, even after they have served their sentence. Most recently Florida reversed one of these laws in the 2018 midterms, but several other states maintain such laws. With tax evasion being a felony, how can states remove the voting rights of tax dodgers circumventing the 24th amendment? The 24th amendment just means that you can’t be forced to pay [a poll tax or other tax, i.e., a fee imposed by the government] in order to vote, not that your voting rights can’t be stripped if you don’t pay your taxes. A poll tax was a discriminatory effort to prevent black people and poor people from voting. Proper sub for next time: [Legal Advice Off Topic]() Or just [wiki it]()  It's not contradictory. The crime is not failing to pay your taxes after having filed a correct return. Unpaid taxes are just a debt that the government will either be able to collect or not be able to collect. The crime is willful evasion and filing knowingly false tax returns which is what Wesley Snipes did. That's the crime, not having an unpaid tax debt.
