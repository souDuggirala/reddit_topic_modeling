 Imagine going about your day and getting an alert that your bank account is below $25. You login and you see "$0". That is what happened to us today. Apparently, the state of CA is garnishing our bank accounts for taxes owed on a business we supposedly owned in 2008. They claimed they mailed letters to the business address but the business has since changed. It went from a tax preparations shop to a UPS. The business was sold in late 2008. They are asking us to produce proof of sale. We shredded those documents years ago. What can we do?  There has to be a record of the sale on file somewhere. You need to find these records.  Sold it in 2008. They claim we own the business from 2008 to 2012.  So...did you own the business or not?
