 I'm a Web Designer based in Pakistan. I landed an hourly contract about 2 years ago to make updates to the website of a clothing store based in San Diego. We worked for about 1 year. But they denied to pay me for my hours last year from August - September. Saying that I'm charging them too much despite of having agreed on a fixed hourly rate earlier. The CEO later phoned me saying I would get paid but I never heard back and it's been 3 - 4 months since then. They owe me about $430 USD for about 22 hours based on $20 / hour (the rate we agreed for) When I didn't get paid I told them that I would have to roll-back all of the updates I made into the site that I did not get paid for. After which Katerina, the manager deletes my account from website administration so that I cannot roll back my updates. When I told this to the CEO, he said she did nothing wrong and said that I threatend them about deleting the site when I clearly just talked about roll backing my updates for which I did not get paid. All of my hours were tracking using the TopTal Hours tracking application. I also havr the tracked hours PDF and all the conversations I've had with both the manager and the CEO.
