 I started a new job and the management just forgets to give me any kind of breaks even when I work 12 hours in a day. I’ve asked them for a 30 min lunch break but they say that we’re super busy and can’t take the time to give me a break. Is this a legal issue ? Any job I’ve worked before (8 hour days ) I would get a mandatory unpaid 30 min break and sometimes even an extra 15 min break. I’ve told other people and they said i should go to HR, but I don’t want to risk anything since this is a new job and they can fire me within the 90 days for anything, so I don’t want to cause an issue. Is this a legal issue though ? I’m in the state of Massachusetts, what is the exact law for taking breaks ?   But not all hope is lost, you cannot be legally retaliated against for seeking to enforce your statutory rights, which in Mass include a 30 min unpaid break if you work 6 or more hours (but Mass does not require any other breaks).  In the US it will likely not exist. But as OP is in Mass there is a law that requires a single 30 min (unpaid) break for any shift that is 6 hours or longer. I was in the same situation, I looked up my Province’s employment standards and, sure enough, human rights DO exist. I brought the information to my boss and everything was sorted out. Turns out he simply didn’t know because it was a small company and that’s what he was told; which he never questioned. In the fine print of the page it mentioned that I couldn’t be fired or discriminated against for bringing it up as well. Look up your local state’s employment standards, and make sure you check specifically for the industry you work in. It will most likely be 30 min for every 5 hours worked
