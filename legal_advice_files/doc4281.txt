 Moved into a new house about a year ago (house was brand new construction) and we’ve had some issues with the septic from the beginning. Right when we moved in the system alarm went off, but stopped shortly thereafter. We’ve heard it go off a couple times since then, but it was never consistent or ongoing. Fast forward to this week and the alarm was going off non-stop a couple days ago. Called the landlord and told him and he sent out a plumber. Got a voicemail last night saying the plumber found two wipes and the bill was around $1200 and he would be sending it to us. We’ve never flushed wipes down are system (that I’m aware) and I’m blown away at how two would cause that much damage. Do I have any options here? I realize it could be an uphill battle since it was new construction and we never raised a flag when the system was alerting early on.  Tell us more about your alarm. Did you hear a septic alarm go off multiple times and not address it or notify your landlord? Ask for proof. Photos, contractor written report What does your lease say about repairs? You probably aren't liable but read your lease. Do you have wipes in the house? It's possible a guest flushed them not knowing you're not supposed to. I do. Would something like this typically be covered? I’ll check my policy.  Do you have renters insurance?
