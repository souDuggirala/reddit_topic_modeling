 I singed a contract with the gym. I went to gym until October. My contract ends on January. For November, December and January I didnâ€™t go to gym. I saw my filtered email today that I was logged in for the three months. I was charged month by month. Now my contract is over. I didnt avail the last 3 month service but I was signed in as I was present by the trainer. I have the notification email that says I logged in those days at the gym. I feel like I have been cheated.  What did your contract say happened at the end of your term? Did the membership automatically stop, or did the membership then continue month to month until canceled by you? It is unlikely that the personal trainer "logging you in" is the problem here and more likely that your failure to cancel the agreement was the problem.
