 I drove into a parking spot before realizing the other car was out of line. I know everyone is eager to tell me that I’m at fault because I hit a stationary object, but there was no way to see how out of line the driver was until I reached into the spot further. When I tried to reverse out, I scraped the other person’s car. When the officer arrived to the scene, he took notes and pictures, then said we were both at fault. However, I don’t know how the insurance companies will interpret this. What does this mean in terms of how much I’ll have to pay? Does the other driver have to pay me as well? Or am I 100% liable? I was stuck in the spot until the police arrived; the only way I was able to get out was by the other driver moving their car out first. It's on you to avoid stationary objects, even when those stationary objects aren't where they're supposed to be or are slightly askew. If you can't pull into or out of a parking spot without colliding with a stationary object, then you just don't move your car until you can do so without colliding with a stationary object. Not materially. It stayed exactly in the same spot. It's no different than if you hit a car parked in the fire lane or improperly parked in a handicap spot. As a driver, you are expected to look and not run into things that aren't moving. Seriously, you are 100% at fault. You can't just run into someone because they parked poorly.  But the stationary car’s position contributed to the incident.  You hit a stationary car? You're most likely to be found totally at fault by the insurance company. Your insurance company's determination of fault is completely separate, but may be influenced by, the police officer's determination of fault.
