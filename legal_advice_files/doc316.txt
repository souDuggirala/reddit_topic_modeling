 I ran a website where I interviewed poets using poetry. I'd ask them a question in the form of a poem and they'd respond in the form of a poem. I've since decided to turn this into an anthology, and most authors have agreed (a few have yet to respond). One mentioned the poems he answered with have since been published in his debut poetry collection, and was uncertain if I'd need to find permission from his publisher. Surely I was the publisher of the poetry first so I can publish it in anthology form? Also, wouldn't the publisher of the debut poetry collection needed to have sought permission from me? (Not that I'm concerned about that second point, the guy is a friend and I'm happy for him with his collection). Try /r/legaladviceuk   ? Also, wouldn't the publisher of the debut poetry collection needed to have sought permission from me? What rights did you ask for when you arranged to put these poems on the website? First publication rights don't imply exclusivity, temporary or permanent, unless you specifically agree to that. Was there any sort of contract?
