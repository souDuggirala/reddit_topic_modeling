 I hired a company here in VA to repave my driveway in June. They did an awful job (seems like they forgot to roll it) and half of my driveway has divots in it from cars and my truck parking on it. I got in touch with the company and have had issues getting them to come out. I finally was able to meet with them and they told me they agreed it was a bad job and they would redo it. I made sure he sent me an email saying that they would redo it. We had set up a day for them to come out but they said I did not contact them confirming (though I have text messages to prove otherwise). They then said they would do it by May of next year and when I have tried to get in touch with them since they have not responded. My wife and I also later learned after some Google searches that this company has been in hot water before (I know, I should have done better research before I hired them to do the job) and found out 3 days after they did our driveway, their license was revoked because they didn't pay back an old client for not showing up to do a job after being paid. I'm just trying to figure out if there is any path I can take that would allow me to get my driveway fixed without having to spend another 3k to pay another company to do it. Thanks for any advice
