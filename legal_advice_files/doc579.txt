 I recently passed trough the border from Cambodia to Laos and thus we were asked to pay money to the border control. I was expecting this, as corruption is part of daily life in SE Asia. However, I was with a group of people from the EU, but we were all asked to pay a different amount, simply because of our nationality. A French couple was asked to pay 25 dollars, an Israeli guy was let off with 30 dollars, but me, as a Danish guy, was asked to pay a whopping 50 dollars. Is there any truth to this or are the land ports simply corrupt?
