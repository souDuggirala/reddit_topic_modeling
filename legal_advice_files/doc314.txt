 The owner of the diner I work at keeps all the credit card tips and we only receive the few bucks in cash that the customer leave. Is that legal? Obligatory NAL, But, sometimes, yes. Depends on where you live and the wage they're paying you (normal minimum Vs. server minimum). Even if legal, still a shitty thing to do IMHO. No- report it to the labour board.  I’m going to say nope.  Wow, that’s pretty shitty.
