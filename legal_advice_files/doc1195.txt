 Hi(on mobile)! My significant other(22M) was terminated from his job for too many absences even thought he had sent the right paper work to prove his leave(“absences”)was for basic training. He had no idea he got fired until he came back for the holidays and it took him 2-3 days of playing telephone with HR. When he approached his HR rep, she told him that she’d be more than happy to have him back once he was back from BCT and AIT. What can he do? He’s stuck with that termination on his record and sure as hell doesn’t wanna go back to that fucking circus. What legal steps can he take? As long as your SO followed the rules then it is impermissible to fire him under these circumstances. I suggest that your SO show HR this link Otherwise, your SO can go to a civilian lawyer who is knowledgeable in employment matters related to the military and look into filing a wrongful termination suit.
