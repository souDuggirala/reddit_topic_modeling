 I lease a space for my business in a 3 business building. The roof over my Landlrods business was leaking so she hired a roofer to repair it. The roofer used a sealent or something that oversprayed and cover my 2 commercial vehicles and a emplyees vehicle and the landlords vehicle. Come to find out the roofer was not lisecenced or insured. And I was not notified of the spraying or the potential damage to vehicles. Therefore my Landlord negligent and voilated our lease requireing all repairs to be done by a trained, qualified and insured repair person. My landlord is trying to force me to use her cheap car wash guy swearing it will fix the damage - but is not a true pro or insured. She says he will do it for $100 and get all 3 vehicles done in 2 hours. The pros I have contacted say it is not possilbe to do them correctly and properly in the little time and are chargeing a reduced rate to me of $150 per vehicle. In addition the employer has spent money trying to get her vehicle cleaned as soon as she say the damage. Her car is her baby. I do not want to have to put this through my auto insurance becasue it is such a little amount and any claim even found in my favor will increase my risk factor when calculating what I pay for my insurance. I do not think it is legal in Texas to withhold rent for this type of repair or on a commercial lease. My other optioln is district court which is a hassle but doable. So what do you recommend? Would going to court allow for any puni8tive damages?
