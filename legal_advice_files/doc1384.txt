 Someone I know got a traffic ticket recently, where the fine was $495 and 3 demerit points (in ontario) for distracted driving (using phone). However, when i spoke to him, he said he wasn't looking at his phone or anything at all. I confirmed that he didn't by looking at his cell records and also his activity log on his phone. Now we have 3 options: plead guilty, early resolution, or plead not guilty. I helped him put in a request for disclosure, and i thought early resolution wouldve been the best option, but now that i think about it, im thinking it might have been better to plead not guilty since we have evidence that he didnt use his phone; im just not sure as to what extent it would be admissible in court. Any help would be appreciated! Yeah im not entirely sure because i dont even know how he was able to pull him over. The cop was apparently on top of a hill and he was waiting on a stop light on the opposite street. I really want the disclosure to come in so i can help him out. I think the disclosure should also show what the cop saw so that will be helpful  Don't know, I'm in the U.S. and unfamiliar with laws there. If you can show without doubt that he wasn't using phone it seems like they couldn't just ignore the facts I helped him put in the request for early resolution, but i think im going to ask them if he can plead not guilty instead. Would they be able to change it if we went in person?  If $495 plus the possible insurance rate hike doesn't bother you go for early resolution. Me, I would fight it.
