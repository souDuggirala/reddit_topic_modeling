 The court date says this is an arraignment, how is this different than a trial? Also since AZ does not expunge public records, does this mean this would show up on all background checks and reported on job applications even if I do not get jail time? Thank You! I will contact a lawyer Thank You! This helps Usually a plea deal is arrange after the arraignment but before trial. Your lawyer of public defender would be able to help you with that. It typically involves a deal with the prosecutor. If you plead guilty at your arraignment you would be at the mercy of the judge for sentencing. Unless you had extreme guilt for you did and want the maximum punishment I can't really think of a good reason to plead guilty at your arraignment. If you're thinking about pleading guilty or trying to get a plea deal, consult an attorney first. Unless the prosecutor has already offered you a deal, it'd be up to your attorney to work with the prosecutor to get you a plea deal. In what cases is it better to admit guilt and enter a plea deal? An arraignment is where your charges are officially read to you and you are able to enter a plea. "Not guilty" is the normal response at this stage in the process. You do not have to present a legal defense at this time. This is usually where you would have the opportunity to obtain a public defender if you are unable to afford an attorney. Depending on the charges bail may also be set at this time.
