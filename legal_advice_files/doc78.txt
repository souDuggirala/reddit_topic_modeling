 I already posted in Workers Comp, but technically its legal so I thought I would post here as well New Jersey - Son severly injured a few years ago. Its been almost 4 years. They stopped paying him over 2 years ago because he reached MMI. They are still paying for all medical needs including his 21st surgery last year. He doesn't need drs as much, maybe 4 times this year. Both atty WC sent him to drs for eval, He has another eval (WC) next month. I thought they would offer a settlement. Just got papers WC hearing in 2 weeks in front of judge. Whats this about?? I updated the question. He doesn't have to appear, he is on call. Apparently the WC is trying to dismiss the case or something like that because he missed one of 3 appts. they scheduled. What happened was they schedule 2 appts for one day 2 hours apart and the driving time between the 2 was well over an hour. He called and said that was impossible to do. A few days later he got 2 letters in 2 envelopes, one said appt was cancelled and would be rescheduled if necessary and the other was a reschedule. We didn't realize they were both about the same dr appt. In workers comp you need to appear for a hearing for the judge to approve the settlement. Your attorney can explain this.
