 [Pennsylvania] My father owns a business and rents his work uniforms from a company that comes and picks them up/cleans and delivers new ones every week. He wasn't happy with an up charge today and wants to cancel his service with the company. My dad says he never signed a contract, but he has been receiving invoices for a year and using the service so I assume he signed something at some point and forgot/lost his copy. I had him send me a copy of the invoice, as I'm going to handle this for him. What is my next move, should I call the company and ask for a copy of the contract? My dad wants out of the contract immediately/no matter what, but I keep telling him it's not as simple as ripping up a piece of paper if he still has time left/money owed on the contract. Thanks in advance for any advice! Yes, a copy of the contract would be the first step. What involvement with this setup do you have? If none, the company is likely under no legal obligation to give you anything, so this may be something your father needs to work on directly himself.
