 This is my brothers family. 2 adults and 2 teens. They have lived in the house for over 4ish years. In fact the homeowner, brothers father in law, had lived with them for about 2 of those years. So homeowner leaves and hand shake a deal which tenants don't live up to. He recently spent a week there telling them daily that he is changing the locks when he leaves (tomorrow?) What does my brother have for options.? When the cops get involved. Where is this headed? I'm terrified for my nieces. Massachusetts The owner/landlord must follow local eviction laws. Your brother should find out what those are for his area. The landlord will have to provide at least some amount of notice, although it may not be terribly long. The family connections donâ€™t really matter.  Please review the [Landlord Tenant Questions]() section of the /r/LegalAdvice Wiki for common questions and answers regarding landlord tenant issues.
