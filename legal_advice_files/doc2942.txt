 There's so much wrong with my apartment that I have no idea where to begin. The biggest issue is a worker must've used a bowl as a "fix" for a leaky sink instead of repairing it before I moved in. It was a oddly placed empty bowl in an under sink cupboard to me when I moved in. Little did I know that the bowl will fill completely and become a terrible moldy liquid that pours like the "non-expired" milk that was on the frontpage of reddit awhile ago. I have submitted several online repair requests for different issues that haven't been responded to over the months with another one for that leak submitted a week and a half ago - still nothing back. It's tearing me apart and makes me feel like I can't invite people over because the mold smell fills my kitchen. I've also gotten sick multiple times since I moved in. How far does this have to go to become a legal matter and is it already past that point? I did see something in another post where a Redditor commented that in Minnesota I have the option to pay rent to the courts who will pay out to my landlord after the repairs are completed. Is this accurate? What would an alternative option look like? Is there no alternative option because this court withholding option exists? Thank you, you wonderful Redditors. Thank you, I will look into that! I caught it before it ever overflowed after moving in and have to consistently empty out the cup. There may be mold in the walls too. After use of the sink there's a loud, but short dripping, inside the wall that is not going into the cup. The droplets that go into the cup wouldn't be able to make that sound. I recommend connecting with HOMELine who can walk you through the process and legal options. Itâ€™s a free service.  Are you saying water spilled because the bowl got too full and that's what caused the mold? Or is the leak behind the walls?
