 I'll occasionally see a police officer while I'm driving who's vehicle is from a town or two over. I wonder if they have the ability to pull someone over for a minor traffic violation. I've read some excerpts from the state constitution. However they use the term "New Hampshire State Police Officer" and it seems ambiguous to me if it is referring to a state trooper or a local police officer. The state in question is NH.
