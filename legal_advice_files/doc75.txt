 The managements at where I work just installed a Nest home security camera plus microphone. At any time the office can listen in on anything being said in the kitchen. This does not feel right. I asked management about legality, and they said they were in the right as long as an obvious recording light was present. Is there anything illegal or unethical about this? Doesn't feel right. In Florida, recording video is allowed as long as it's not in a bathroom or somewhere where people expect to have privacy but recording audio requires consent. That said, just because the device is capable of recording up audio doesn't mean it is. I'm not a lawyer but from what i could find they are legally allowed to record you in their business as long as it's not in an area where you have an expectation of privacy. see [this link]() for more info.
