 Hello I needed legal advice. I live in Baltimore Maryland, my mom moved in two strangers out of the kindness of her heart into our basement. There was a oral agreement but no signed lease that they could temporary live there with rent paid every month. They have proof of residency from mail and have been here for 30 days. My family feels very unsafe because they have become violent and started steeling. We have asked them to leave but we have to get a eviction notice. My question is legally are we allowed to lock the basement door and keep them out of our living space? Only thing we agreed to rent them was the basement. Only thing that is in the basement is the washer and dryer which belong to my parents. NAL and NALL You would be committing an illegal eviction. The only thing you can do now is file for an eviction. 30-60 days(depending on where you are) if you cannot prove nonpayment..
