 Two days ago I bought a car in New York from a dealer. I am a first-time car buyer. I was not familiar with how this is supposed to work. I have now noticed some strange stuff. First, it’s a financed deal. They claimed they used Chase to finance it. But they didn’t show me any documents from Chase. I figured at the time I didn’t care how they financed it but now I read about yo yo scams and am worried. (They did provide a Retail Installment Contract document showing what I am supposed to pay them.) Today I called Chase. They found no record of any loan. I also noticed on a Retail Certificate of Sale document that they put an amount $2000 higher than what we agreed to. Finally, they did not give me any Bill of Sale. They gave me a Retail Certificate of Sale document but I believe that is not the same, right? I would like, if possible, to unwind this deal. What can I do?  They're mutually contradictory.  Go read them. That's what you agreed to.  I signed both the Retail Certificate of Sale and the Retail Instalment Contract.  You really need to look at the papers you signed. It's anyone's guess what you signed.  The Retail Certificate of Sale document does not mention that. The Retail Installment Contract does mention it and it matches the actual amount paid.  Does the certificate specify a down payment? Does it match what you actually paid down? Yeah. I don't remember signing it. The number is misaligned. It's hard to read. The guy was pressuring me about buying add-ons. Somewhere I probably did sign it.  Yes I took the vehicle. Did you sign this certificate that promised them $2000 more than you negotiated? Have you taken delivery of the vehicle?
