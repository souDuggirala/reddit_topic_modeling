 If rent a car in the us but over another country's website, is that legal? It's a lot cheaper. Then I say book it on the cheaper one. Everything is the same except the website region/language setting. Please clarify. Is that the price to rent in Germany? If so, you’re not comparing apples to apples. Car rental price varies a lot even within the us. Manhattan is going to cost a lot more than a small city in the Midwest. Prices go up during holiday weeks too. Same with hotels. Also, maybe shop around for different companies, or even just different pickup locations with the same company. Airport locations are sometimes more expensive than ones in the suburbs, maybe enough cheaper that you just take a subway or taxi to get away from the airport. Some big city hotels have car rental pickups on site too. Not sure if they’re more or less expensive though. I am curious how you're seeing the same things through different regional website. How do you plan to get the car from Germany to the US? It's just ridiculous, renting a car in the US for one week is 900 USD, but on the German website it's only 450 USD, same conditions, same category. If nothing else it's going to be against the terms of the contractual terms you agree to when you book the car.
