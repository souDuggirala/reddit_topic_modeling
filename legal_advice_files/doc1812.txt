  I am dually licensed in the State of WI as a Licensed Professional Counselor and Clinical Substance Abuse Counselor and have just opened a private practice. I have several inquiries about whether I could administer a urine drug screen to ensure adherence to treatment. I am having little luck finding any information on this. My prior experience with administering these was at a clinic where nurses were available; I had heard that a nurse needed to be on staff, however, I know that parole officers, etc., often administer them so I'm double checking. Also, I'm not a clinic, I'm on my own as a private practice (LLC). Thank you for tolerating the request for free legal advice; clearly if I pursue this, I will seek out a lawyer to help me draft paperwork.
