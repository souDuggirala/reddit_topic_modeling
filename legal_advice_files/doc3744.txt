 As the title says my phone number of 10 years is being used by telemarketers. I rarely text and hardly ever even call people that I do not know, as well as I never sign up for stuff online using my phone number either. The first time I received an angry call I googled it and some advice said to wait 48 hours some said to wait up to a week and the calls will stop since they do not use numbers very long. It has been a little over a month and the amount of angry people I get calling me is increasing and part of me feels really bad that my phone number is now used to annoy the heck out of people part of me is angry and sad someone is abusing my phone number. I feel almost violated and helpless that someone has my phone number and is using it for such a horrible purpose. Is there anything I can do that is not changing my phone number? Sorry if this is the wrong place, but I do not know who or where to ask for help. I know this is a pain, but unfortunately there isn’t much to be done about it. You may want to block numbers that you don’t know, or let things go to voicemail. You are apparently a victim of spoofing, which is when someone makes it seem as if a call is coming from you.  There is no viable solution to this issue as of yet. It's happening to almost everyone. The telemarketers are simply spoofing caller ID numbers -- they're not intentionally spoofing your specific number, they're just spoofing a lot of numbers, a lot of them belonging to actual people like you and me. Not much to feasibly do until the government and/or FCC, or the carriers themselves do something about it.
