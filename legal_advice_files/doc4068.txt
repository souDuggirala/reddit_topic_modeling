 So earlier this morning at like 4:00 AM, I get pulled over for lacking a license plate light. I give the sheriff my insurance and license. He comes back and tells my my license is suspended. I also have a pending DWI. So my question is would getting driving on suspended license worsen the DWI conviction/sentencing? How bad? Like will I have a jail sentence? For reference, Iâ€™m being charged with a BAC .136 - a Class B Misdemeanor - and I was involved in an accident when it happened (no one harmed and on,y damage was to my car). Yes, very much so. Yes. Talk to your attorney. If you didn't already have one, get one now.
