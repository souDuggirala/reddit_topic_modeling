 My next door neighbor seems to have installed some kind of reverse exhaust hose from his basement that is incredibly noisy and reverberating in our bedroom. It's been causing me migraines and neither of us can sleep. I'm so pissed off right now that I have no idea what question I'm asking... but is this legal? If this is NJ, call your county health department. Have you spoken with the neighbors about it being a disturbance to you? They may not be aware of the problem.  That is what I'm going to do. It will probably permanently destroy our goodwill as neighbors to have someone inspect whatever they are doing, but I can't take it anymore. It might be a code issue, but that is something we cannot determine here. If it is super loud, it also might break city or municipal noise ordinances. Contact code enforcement and inform them of what the issue is and if they are able to send an inspector, and check if your area has noise ordinances. If yes, and the neighbor is violation them, you can call the police non-emergency number to report.
