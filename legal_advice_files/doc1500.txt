 I'll try to make this brief. Back in 2016 I worked as a contractor for Google through Adecco. Part of the job was to handle a number of phones for testing purposes. Most phones were through T-Mobile, however one phone model required that we purchase a plan through Verizon. So, I created the account under my name, charged it to the company card, bill sent to Google's address, etc. I vaguely recall attempting to make a business account through Verizon, but not being able to and as with most things in my job I was under a time crunch. Fast forward to now, my contract ended in Dec. 2016, just checked my credit report and I have a Verizon account in collections that I owe $441 on. Contacted Verizon, they say since my SSN is on the account I am liable. I've gotten a call from a collections company but I won't be talking with them. I shudder to attempt to contact my old Google manager (satan himself), but I have attempted to reach out to the old manager at Adecco to see what she might say. Please tell me I'm not liable for this. I've never used this account for anything but business purposes, I haven't seen a bill for it since I left Google, and it had completely slipped my mind until I saw it on my credit report. Do I need to get a lawyer? Should I try to contact the Google legal team directly? There's a distinct possibility that some or all of the charges on this line are fraudulent, again I haven't seen a bill for over 2 years.  So far as Verizon is concerned yes, you are liable. You signed the agreement, Verizon doesnâ€™t have a contract with your old employer, they have a contract with you. Now, your employer is liable to you based on your agreement with them, but you cannot force Verizon to go directly to the employer.
