 They refuse to give it to her even though she’s 19, unless she agrees to specific terms. It was set up by her grandmother for her before she passed away. We’re not sure who’s name the account is in but when she logs into her banking app she can see the balance of the account but has no access to it. Any ideas? Can GF go to the bank with her ID and ask about the account? If her name is on the account, the bank should give her the information about it and answer any questions, such as if she can take out the money now that she is a legal adult. If she can take it out, she should open an account in a different bank and transfer it there. Note: it's not that the bank is bad, it's that sometimes mistakes are made and her aunt might convince the bank to move the money back; having a totally new bank prevents such mistakes. $5600 and it’s terms for a car. Certain year, condition, mileage. Things like that. Which we both understand is not a bad hung at all but they’re not realizing that if she spends every penny of it she has no money left for insurance or repairs. How much money and what are the terms they want her to meet?
