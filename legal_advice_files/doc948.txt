 I purchased a cpo golf tdi from a vw dealership on New Years. It was quite the bleh buying experience from the start, the car had blemishes, they had to do work to it before it could be delivered to me, and took over a week in total despite telling me it would be a day or 2. When the car was delivered, there were blemishes on the paint on the front and rear bumper a ding on the door, and other paint scratches. I was given a due bill for the body blemishes as well as a due bill for a sub woofer that was stolen from the car. (???) I was cool about all of this, because I was just happy to finally happy that I get to drive my car. Well fast forward to today, I still have no sub, or call for a body work appointment like I was told I would get. Today, I get a call from the dealership saying they messed up the smog paper work and need me to come down to have it all re done. Iâ€™m over it at this point, do I have any outlets to initiate a buy back here? Sorry if this seems like a run on. If you have any more questions let me know!
