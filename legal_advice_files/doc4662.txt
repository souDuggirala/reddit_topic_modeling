 I feel like I’m having a panic attack right now. There’s so much on my mind and I don’t have the money for any of this. I feel like there’s no one to turn to as well I’m so scared. It happened back in February when I was driving to work. These women in the car made a dash at a red light while I was in another lane about to turn when I hit them. Afterwards, they wanted to claim they were injured (a lie because the cop that arrived told me they looked to be playing up the dramatics), and they also lied up and down how they didn’t run that light. Unfortunately I’m at fault for hitting them is what I was told. But I had insurance at the time so I didn’t worry too much. Today, I get a letter saying I’m being sued for $15,000!!! Why does this year keep shitting on me? Just when I think I’m out of the clear with one thing it’s always another. I feel like crying right now. [removed] What is your location? I am willing to bet the $15,000 is cited in the Complaint for purposes of meeting the jurisdictional threshold with the Court. Call your insurance company. Their responsibility. You will be fine.  Call your car insurance company and let them handle it. That's what you pay them to do.  Call your insurance company. Doesn't matter if you don't use them now, you did at the time. They'll provide a lawyer who will settle within policy limits.
