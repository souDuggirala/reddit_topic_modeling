 A question related to patents and copyrights. I saw a device online and I think I can make a better version of it and I sell it by starting my own company. Can I keep the same design as the original device or there are some regulations regarding that? Also is it legal to manufacture and sell something that looks like some other company's product? In simple words: can I make a copy of the existing device but with improved and additional features? Is there a document which says that there has to be certain points of change in the two designs so the company doesn't sue me?  Yes. Actually I am just copying the concept but the design will be my own. It's like Apple made iPhone and then Samsung released Galaxy phones looking like iPhones. They had the same concept and similar design but they lost the lawsuit against Apple on patent bet. I do not want to make the same mistake and so I came here to ask for advice. Thanks. It has to be different enough that a casual observer wouldn't mistake your product from their product. There are no clear guidelines for how to do that, because it is simply impossible to formulate anything like that for the vast viarity of products. So, just go for the rule of thumb, if someone who knows the original product sees your product, would they think it is the original product without looking too close at it.
