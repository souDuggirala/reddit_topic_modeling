 No I know that part, Ive just never seen an i9. As crazy as that may seem An I-9 is just a verification of information. There's no background check. A background check would. And if your employer asks about criminal activity that would preclude you from the job you should not lie. Ahh. Does it show past criminal records? An I-9 is used to verify your citizenship and ability to legally work in the US.
