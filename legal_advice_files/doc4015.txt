 Hi. I've looked around on the internet and couldn't find a simple answer. I'm in the process of filling out divorce papers for an absolute divorce (uncontested). Part of the Complaint form, question 7, states "The Plaintiff, complaining of the Defendant, alleges: That there were: (Option 1) There are no minor children who were born of the marriage of the parties. (Option 2) \_\_\_\_\_ (number of children) who were born to the marriage/parties." Here's the situation. My wife and I separated (longer than a year ago), after we separated she got pregnant, had a child, and has been receiving child support from the father. So my question is, which option do I choose? I'm concerned about the legal wording here. Thanks in advance. Bonus question, when filling out divorce paperwork, are middle names required in all name spaces? [removed]  . You need to contest paternity unless you want to be the father. I don't know, but I'll find out. I highly doubt it, he wanted no part in the process. If it has been adjudicated that he is father of that child, then that child is not a child born of the marriage because you are seeking custody, visitation, and/or child support of that child. You should include full names in the caption and int the first reference of the names in the complaint. After that you can use a shortened name to reference the parties.  You say she receives child support. Is there a court order for child support? Did the other guy sign the birth certificate? You're likely the father of the child unless you effectively contested paternity.
