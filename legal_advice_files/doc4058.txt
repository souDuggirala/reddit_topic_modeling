 Someone slipped (not due to any negligence of the manager it was a small patch of ice in the parking lot. Very small. Like 4 inches square) and is threatening to sue not only the store but sounds like the manager personally as well. Is this a thing that can happen or is there something where they are protected by the company they work for? I guess anything can happen. I suppose I am asking is there any chance we need to worry about it going anywhere.  They'd also have to prove damages Anyone can sue for anything, the real question is if there is a chance the arsehole customer might win. They'd have to prove that the store/manager knew there was a risk of ice/that the ice was there and then prove that they failed to act on that knowledge.  If anyone is liable if should be the business, but if the manager is actually sued he needs to get a lawyer. The manager should only be liable if he was acting maliciously or doing things that were pretty much totally unrelated to his job.
