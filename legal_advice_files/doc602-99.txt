I’m living in France, but I did an internship in Malta for 4 months. 

I went to an estate agency there, and an agent found a nice apartment for me.

4 months go by, and on the day that I’m supposed to meet the landlord, give her back the keys, and get my deposit back (850€), she doesn’t show up! Doesn’t return my calls either...

Unfortunately, she knew that I had to leave the country and she took advantage of it.

The agent said he told her to give me back my money but she clearly has no intention to do it.

I have her name, number, and the name of her husband. Possibly even her address, but nothing more...

What can I do here?
