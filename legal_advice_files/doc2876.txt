 I currently live in the same home as my father who racked up considerable debt, is now having items repossessed. Is there any way to prove that certain items are mine? For example, I have a PC I built and has parts that I either payed cash, received as gifts from friends and or lost the receipts for.  That's my understanding. I'm going to assume your second point is correct, being that the repossession was carried out by a sheriff. Do the creditors need to get approval from the courts on every item? It's possible he put the title of the car up as collateral for his latest loan. Or that this lender used its own records to find out about the car and got a specific court order to seize it to pay down the debt. The car was originally financed but has been payed off for years. Though it is the same credit company that gave him the loan in the first place that he is in debt to now, if that is any help. Presumably because he financed it and fell behind on the payments? That's normal. When you finance a car you actually give the lender something called a 'lien' which means they also kind of own the car. And since cars are big, easy to find, and relatively easy to resell, it makes sense for a lender to recoup their losses by taking back the car and reselling it. It has nothing to do with the rest of your stuff. So far the only item that has been taken was the car.  What items of his have been repossessed? Generally creditors don't just walk into your house and start grabbing random things.
