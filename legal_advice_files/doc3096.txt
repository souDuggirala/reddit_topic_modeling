 Hello everyone, this is my first time posting here, and I'm looking for some advice. For the background, I live in Europe. 3 months ago I placed an order on a German online shop to buy cheap booze, but I still did not receive my order. I tried contacting them many times through different channels, but never got an answer. From what I've gathered I'm not the only one in this position, and it looks like the company is going to be liquidated. I paid my order using my credit card. What should I do, is there any way for me to get my money back? Should I contact my bank even though the payment occurred 3 months ago? Try /r/legaladviceuk  I would call your credit card customer service, explain to them you paid for a product, the product was never delivered and you tried to resolve this with the seller, however the seller has not been willing to fulfill the order nor refund your money and not the seller seems to be going out of business. Most likely they will advise you to file a charge back. There is a risk that the seller could count that as a debt and send the balance to collections which would effect your credit score and you would then need to dispute that. However, if they are in the process of going out of business I doubt they would do so.
