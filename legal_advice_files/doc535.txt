 Ok thanks  Then ignore it. It's only a problem if you want to get a transcript/sign up for classes from that college.  I donâ€™t attend the college  Do you attend the college? Because they will put a hold on academics for unpaid tickets. If you do not attend, you may be ok to ignore it. Although some schools have an way to share ticket info with local PD. It depends.
