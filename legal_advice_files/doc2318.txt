 This is really a contract law issue that is made more complicated by working in the cannabis industry. I have worked providing business services to the cannabis industry for a few years. I had this big client that consisted of 4 investors that started a multi-million dollar business. I worked for them for almost 2 years getting their business started from scratch. They rarely got along with each other which caused me to stop working for them. Fast forward 1.5 years, I still haven’t been paid a substantial lump sum. I have a contract that guarantees payment by a specified date that has passed, but they don’t seem to care or acknowledge their debt. I know they aren’t paying other vendors/taxes, but are continuing to operate. I want to shut them down, but I really need the money they owe me and I don’t want to sabotage my own payment. What would you do to force a cannabis company to pay what they owe?  Wage claim suit maybe but that doesn’t seem right as the limit in Oregon is $10k and this is a for lot more than that. I’m starting to think my lawyer is just a contract lawyer and isn’t ready for a battle like this.  Hire a lawyer and sue them. What did your lawyer tell you? You sue them like any other business. Unless of course you mean you are operating this illegally in a state where there is no state level legalization and are thus a part of a criminal conspiracy in which case you realize you are a fucking moron for engaging in a criminal conspiracy and eat your loss and move on.
