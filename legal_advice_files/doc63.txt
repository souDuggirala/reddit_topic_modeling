 This is more of a general question, hopefully, irrelevant to the residence. I need to get a document certified/legalized by the State Department (it is the original, not a notarized copy) to be then authenticated/legalized by the Chinese Embassy for a visa. China does not recognize apostilles (not part of Hague Convention). If in the future I need an apostille, can I just add it or do I need to get a notarized copy of the certified doc THEN get it apostilled?
