 Since it seems to be a growing trend im not positive, is it legal to sell nudes for $$ if you’re over 18?  I’m not selling hahaha even though it might seem like it. I know minors is CP would be illegal, I just wasn’t completely sure about adults! I see a lot of women on tinder who seem like they sell.  If the pictures are of you, yes. Make sure you aren’t selling to minors. If the nudes are of you and you're over 18 and your customer is over 18 then yes.
