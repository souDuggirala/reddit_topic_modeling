 I live in Arizona. Is there any issue with using a blog posts content if I plainly attach the cited link and other info? I had heard that you aren't even allowed to do that but can't find anything that talks on this. I see. What the goal is, is to provide educational material on my own website. I'm a graphic designer who own's a marketing company and I wanted to setup a blog that shares relatable content from other sites.  If the purpose of the blog is teaching, news reporting, criticism, research, etc it might be covered under the fair use doctrine, which would allow you to post small portions of copyrighted content. The US Copyright Office has an extensive body of information on what is considered fair use on their website, so check that out if you have any concerns;  Simply citing something is generally not enough to get around copyright law. To use someone else's copyrighted material in its entirety, you generally need their explicit permission. Perhaps linking to someone else's copyrighted work might be a way around whatever you're doing, maybe?
