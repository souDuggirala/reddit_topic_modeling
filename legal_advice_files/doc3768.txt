 I sent a barrage of profanity-laced angry texts accusing my former business partner of everything in the book. I woke up this morning feeling regret and am worried. He never responded but it shows he has read it, so I am worried. What's the worst that can happen, can he sue me for anything? Well at least you learned a lesson. It is unlikely anything will happen. But we don’t have a crystal ball.  Emotional damages are rarely ever a thing. Anyone can sue anyone for anything. You would probably be best off not communicating with this person any more for any reason. If they threaten to sue you should ignore them. If they actually sue you should hire a lawyer and have your lawyer respond for you. [deleted] Unless you threatened him with violence it is unlikely anything will happen. Don’t send him any more communications, don’t talk about him online, stay away from him. You don’t want to give him a reason to go to the police. If you did threaten him with violence what could happen depends on the content of threat. Terroristic threatening, harassment, etc. Just stead clear of the guy going forward. Don’t even send an apology. Maybe block him from everything so you aren’t tempted again. If you need to communicate in the future, do it through a lawyer.   's the worst that can happen, can he sue me for anything? Depends almost entirely on the content and context of the messages you sent. As long as you drop it, don't post them anywhere public, the most you should get is a cease and desist or no contact. Only contact him from this point forward legitimate reasons concerning your former business venture; be respectful, and only talk on topic.  You sent them only to him? Can anything you said be construed as a threat?
