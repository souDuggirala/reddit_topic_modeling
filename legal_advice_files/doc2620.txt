 I am a 17 year old male that recently snuck over to a girls house, her parents unfortunately found out and I have a few questions. Her parents want to find my phone number and address and I was wondering if the police are even gonna bother trying to find me considering we are both minors, also, will anything legal arise from this considering we weren't even engaging in any form of sexual activity, thanks. No. Legally she is allowed to have guests in her home. You didn't break any laws by going to her house.  Your ok, chances are they are angry but have very little comeback if the girl invited you over  NAL but I believe the daughter has equal capacity to invite you to that property as the parents so, legally, I donâ€™t think they could do anything.
