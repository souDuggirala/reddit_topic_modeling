 So recently I was using a webcam for a "private" conversation and then I get a text and a video from an unknown number that they have my nudes and are going to post them if I dont send them $100 by Saturday. I dont plan on sending them any money but I am a bit scared that my nudes will get leaked. Is there any way to prevent this? It's a very common scam we get 3+ people coming here each week about this. There's nothing you can do really. Block them. Don't talk to them. Hopefully they'll move on to someone else. You can call the police if you want. It's not likely they can do anything about it. If the blackmailer's find out you called the police, they might retaliate. Or maybe not.  Yeah that's probably a good idea   Stop broadcasting your junk on the internet. Nothing on the internet should be assumed to be private.
