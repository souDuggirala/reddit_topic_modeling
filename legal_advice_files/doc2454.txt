 Not sure what flair to add but itâ€™s related with family My friend who is 18 recently got kicked out of the house by an abusive father and mother. He is currently house hopping and the father messaged him stating to not come back to the house and now that he is 18, he can go live by himself. What can my friend do and can he get any legal assistance. His 12 year old sister is still at the house. She is also abused mentally and verbally. Please any help would mean the world to him. Thank you For any needed information please let me know Thank you again  In New York, your friend is an adult, and his parents are no longer obligated to house or feed him. He was owed 30 days' notice before his parents kicked him out, but if he's getting free housing from friends, his damages for not receiving that notice are damn close to zero, and it likely isn't worth pursuing. Moving forwards - getting his own home sorted out, either on his own or with stable roommates - is probably a better use of his time than looking backwards. He can and should report suspected child abuse, neglect, and violence to [CPS](), or to 911 in an emergency. If he needs help preparing a resume and finding work, there are a number of job placement agencies operating out of NYC. Thank you. We are in the US, nyc Edit. Also he just turned 18 which is the legal age and he was thrown out along with his clothes  Jurisdiction matters, but if he's somewhere where the age of majority is 18 or less, then 95% of what he can do is "look for a job and an apartment and move on with his life." The remaining 5% depends on whether he agreed to leave or was physically removed or locked out, and in either case is really unlikely to amount to much. If he's concerned his sister may be abused, he can report it to his jurisdiction's child welfare agency so that they can investigate.
