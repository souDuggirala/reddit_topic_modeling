Is it legal for political agencies  too call people advertising candidates and asking if you will be voting for them ?

This is one Georgia and in the past few days I’ve had multiple calls from places advertising and asking if I planned on voting for political candidates They have been by actual people and not robo calls is this legal and if not were does it saw it’s not so when I get a call I can tell them it’s illegal and quote where it’s stated thanks  Ok that’s what I was expecting kinda sad though most of the time I just take up their time by saying ok after every question I do this with scam callers too sometimes you can get them on for a while sometimes they catch on quick  Legal and very, very common. You can just hang up, you don't have to answer them.
