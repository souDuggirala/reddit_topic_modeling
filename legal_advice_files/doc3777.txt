 Yes That’s completely understood here - the question is how do they determine the amount when custody is no longer a factor? If an 18yo no longer spends 25% of their time with the noncustodial parent in that year, since, they don’t have to follow that agreement AND they’re working after school, etc., how does the system calculate the support between 18 and 19? Most of the time, the non-cusodial parent still owes support if the dependent doesn’t graduate until 19 Does the mother have a lawyer who works with child support cases?
