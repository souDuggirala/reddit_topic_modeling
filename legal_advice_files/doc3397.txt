 We recently purchased a house in Colorado (about 4 months ago). On the list of things to be fixed were some plumbing issues (which were to be fixed by a licensed plumber) but I found out were all done by an incompetent handyman. Not that it’s a lot in the grand scheme of things, but the shoddy plumbing work that this guy did has so far cost me about $1500. One of the items that was on the list to do was never done and he did some weird stuff with the shower plumbing, which led to a massive leak that let our over a support beam any time we showered or bathed I’m sure I have no recourse, but I’m furious that this is the 3rd time I’ve had to call a licensed plumber to come fix the shit job the handyman did. I’d really like to be able to recover some of my losses if possible though. So.. is there something I can do or should I just suck it up and write it off as home ownership expenses? You should have verified the work was done correctly by getting a copy of the receipts and having your home inspector come back after the work was done.
