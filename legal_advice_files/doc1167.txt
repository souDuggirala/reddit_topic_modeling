 I'm filling my taxes for this year and I'm not sure if I'm in the right sub for this. My brother passed away suddenly last year and I made a go fund me for funeral costs and I ended raising almost 3000 dollars. Do I have to file as income or is this considered a gift?  Thank you. If you are the executor or the administrator of your brother's estate and the money was used only for the funeral then you just report it for the estate. Unfortunately, funeral expenses are not tax deductible except usually except for a meal. I'm sorry for your loss. Thanks for your help :) Although this area of law and regulation is still somewhat unclear, it is very likely that the donations made are legally characterized as gifts. You do not have to pay any tax on gifts or report them as income. For more information, you can read this article in the journal of accountancy on this particular issue.
