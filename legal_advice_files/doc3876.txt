 Hey everyone. Not sure if this is the right flair to use, but I'm in need of advice regardless. I have 3 banks unfortunately. 1. Texans Credit Union, main debit, which I've used for a while 2. Capital 1, credit 3. Aadp, which last employer gave me because I was too lazy to give my direct deposit to. So here's how my little system worked. Get paid from 3. Withdraw from 3. Deposit in 1. And pay 2 with 1. Now. Here's where it got all funky. Right before Thanksgiving, I paid off 2 instead of auto pay. It actually withdrew $500 twice (initial payment+auto pay) which put 1. In the negative by a couple hundred. No big deal, I'll just call and fix it. I call 2. Get them to refund the other $500, but itll take 5 business days. Great it's the weekend, gotta wait a whole week. Within a day, my car payment, internet, and spotify subscription all auto paid from 1. Now I'm extra negative ($35) per charge when I'm over drafted. After that happens. I get fired for calling out corporate corruption at Samsung. Woaahhh life you suck. Still have some money in 3, but not enough to pull out of negative and not enough time before more payments. So now, I have gotten a new job, set up direct deposit, but wont get paid until the end of the month because pay gets withheld an extra 2 weeks. I received a call yesterday saying my bank account (1.) will be closed and they will report me so other banks wont let me open an account. All of this could have been avoided if my payment didnt get sucked out twice. Is there anything I can do for leanency so my Direct deposit can hit? Will I be able to actually get a bank account again? Kinds need money for rent and stuff... which is coming up in a few days. I'm pretty much down to my last few bucks, and just waiting to get paid. Any advice??
