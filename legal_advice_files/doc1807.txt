  I signed a lease with my landlord from the period December 1, 2017 through March 31, 2018 (16 months). The lease specifically states "for the term of 16 months beginning January 1, 2018 and terminating on April 30, 2019. The rent to be paid by the lessee for the leased premises shall be as follows: The term rent shall be $38,400.00, payable, except as herein otherwise provided, in installments of $3,200.00, on the 1st day of every month, in advance, so long as this lease is in force and effect." As of this month, we've now paid $38,400.00 under the terms of the lease and the Landlord is looking for January's rent. Are we still obligated to pay through April 30, 2019?  You have to pay it. An obvious mistake or typo won't matter in court. There are 2 reasons this is the case. 1 because people (like you) think they are clever and that being a smart ass (from your comments) will help them, and 2 because the law is actually, contrary to popular beliefs as a result of media exaggerating shit, a lot more reasonable than people think. Frankly, I'm not sure why you ask if you can argue that in court if you are gonna be a argumentative/smartass when people answer your question with a no. This is just another one of the cases you see here daily of people asking if going to court and acting like they don't know what "speding" on their ticket means to try and get out of a speeding fine is a good idea We're telling you that you are liable. You're choosing to ignore our advice and argue it instead. If you think you know better than everyone else here, then feel free to not pay your January rent, and we look forward to your next post in a few weeks about what to do when you're being evicted. I'm trying to understand the difference, but just go ahead and berate me instead.   It's not. But I can see you have it all figured out, so forge ahead. The contract states "...the term rent shall be \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, payable, except as herein otherwise provided, in installments of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, on the first day of every month, in advance, so long as this lease is in force and effect." The first blank is written in pen $38,400.00. The second blank is written in pen $3,200.00. Aren't contracts typically interpreted based upon their plain language? What would your response be if this were a properly executed Purchase and Sales agreement with a sales price of $150,000.00 when the seller actually meant to write in $180,000.00?   Yes. It's because you keep saying that your contract says something material that it doesn't say (at least, according to what you quoted). For example... It doesn't say "until X is reached". It's comical how the answers here differ from the answers on avvo. Is there a reason I ask a question in r/legaladvice and get bashed without any sort of legal analysis involving my question? Great community around here...  Yes. You...want me to tell you what you think? You tell me.  Yes, you're correct, when you change the wording of a clause in a contract, the meaning of the clause/contract changes. Are you even a lawyer?   $3,200.00, on the 1st day of every month, in advance, so long as this lease is in force and effect." Do you think we're blind, or just stupid? It reads almost as an installment contract -- it essentially states tenant will pay the sum of X, payable in installments of Y until X is reached. My obligations under the contract are to pay X, his are to provide housing from Jan. 1, 2018 - April 30, 2019. All correspondence besides the lease have been in person or over the phone.   "for the term of 16 months beginning January 1, 2018 and terminating on April 30, 2019. The rent to be paid by the lessee [...] in installments of $3,200.00, on the 1st day of every month, in advance, so long as this lease is in force and effect." You lift out the unnecessary phrase and it's clear that phrase is contradicted by the overall agreement's terms. Obviously a typo. You don't need to convince me, or reddit, you need to convince a judge when you're sued for eviction for non-payment. What contradiction are you referring to? The lease literally says tenant will pay the sum of X, payable in installments of Y until X is reached. There is no other provision in the lease regarding rental payments.  So the landlord calculated the rent wrong on the lease? Were there other communications between the two of you communicating a different number? If itâ€™s very clear that the number on the lease was a typo, and the correct numbers were communicated elsewhere, you may need to continue to pay the monthly rent. No reasonable person would believe the intent was to give you four months of rent for free. The $38,400 is clearly a mistake. Pay your rent. Meting of the minds. Typos. What is a judge going to decide if you try to argue that. You can honestly testify you signed the lease believing that you'd get 4 months free? You could stop paying rent now, get an eviction on your record/credit, and even if you somehow win in court you'll still have that black mark.
