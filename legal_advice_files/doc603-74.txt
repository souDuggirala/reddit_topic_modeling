Its moslty junk mail and ads for stores. The mail person must not check names too well as I get neighbors mail who live a street over from mine almost everyday. If I don't want to walk to their house every single day will I get in legal trouble for not handing their mail back to them? After all its not my jobs but the mail persons who refuses to do their job right. 

New Jersey Yes, you will.  You can give it back to the carrier who mis-delivered it to you, take it to a post office, or just drop it in any big blue sidewalk mailbox. 1. Place it back in your mailbox and the mailman will take it to the correct address
2. Contact your local postmaster and complain
3. Do not just throw it away [deleted]
