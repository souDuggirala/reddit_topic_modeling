 Just got a call today from an admin from my psychiatrist office who stated they are dropping me from their practice for rescheduling too many times. I admit I have rescheduled but I have never missed any appointment. I don’t remember signing any contract that says rescheduling will cause me to be removed from their practice. It took me 4 months for find a psychiatrist because apparently where I live there is a shortage of psychiatrists. I’ve called the office to request at least give me enough refills so I can find another practice and have not heard back yet. Can they legally do this? Can I file a complaint with any governing body that deals with psychiatry. I only have few days of pills left. I’ll be calling my primary care doctor to see if they call help me. Do I have any legal standing here?  [deleted] [deleted]
