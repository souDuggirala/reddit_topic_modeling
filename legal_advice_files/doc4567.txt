 I was a social worker in Canada \[I have since moved to USA\]. I worked for a private foster agency for 3 months which managed foster homes. In the news recently it's come out that there was sex abuse going on towards a child in one of those homes, and the agency "dragged their feet" in disclosing this. Now the man is being charged. I was only there for 3 months, but I did get a call from the news prying for info as I had that company on my linkedin. I have no clue if this was anyone I had any contact with as no names are disclosed. I never knew about ANY abuse or any allegations and I was under training for most of my time there, I only ever did a few visits alone before I quit. I don't even live there anymore. The province has this agency under review, will I get called on to testify or anything considering I don't even live in Canada anymore?  You're jumping the gun. If you do have any useful testimony to give, first they would have to discover that by having investigators reach out to you and interview you. They wouldn't just call you to testify in court with no idea what you'd be saying. And if that does happen you'd have someone you could ask this question of who would at least know whether they have any interest in calling you to testify. They can subpoena you to force you to testify. If you refuse you would have to be extradited to face charges in Canada if you don't go willingly, but as I understand it the charge (contempt of court) is sufficient to meet the requirements of the Canada Extradition Treaty.
