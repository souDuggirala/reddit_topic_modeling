In the state of Florida is it legal for an apartment complex to only allow you to pick up packages at certain times of the day? I work strange hours and the only time I'd be able to pick them up would be before work or on Tuesday and their "package pick up times" dony coincide with this. 

This really isn't optimal for me and I believe if my package had arrived I should have the right to obtain it if the office is open. I did not agree to tany of this when I signed the lease either. New management took over and all of a sudden there was a notice on everyone's door.

So, is this legal? Is there anything I can do if it isn't?  And if it is are there any alternatives to recieving packages from USPS, FedEx etc.? It could be that there were no terms.  If they did not explicitly state that they would accept your packages AND make them available to you during certain hours then they have no obligation to.  No idea the specifics of your apartment building but generally the delivery services do not deliver "to the door" in apartment buildings but probably a question you'd need to ask them directly.

Edit: The alternative is to get a P.O. Box.  This is a good example of why they exist. I don't recall much about the role of package delivery in my lease, but I do know that these weren't the terms because this was only put into place recently with new management. 

Regarding the fact that they dont have to accept my packages. Is there any way to just have them delivered to my door instead? That would be preferred honestly.  What does your lease say with regard to management's role with package delivery?  Without anything in the lease, the property owners/mgmt generally have no obligation to accept packages for you at all.
