 I am writing a paper for a class and I am trying to look for penalties for lying on a marriage license application. I tried looking up laws in the US but I can’t find any. Also, sorry in advance if this isn’t the place to post.  You want to talk to a family law attorney. How would one go about reporting this? I am in AZ and am unfortunately in this situation. He said he'd never been married and come to find out I was #4 AND he was already married when he married me.  You could be charged with perjury or a misdemeanor, but do some research on this as the punishment for both of these varies from state to state. [removed] Also if the person was still married to someone else and they got married again it would be bigamy which is a crime in every state. Thank you very much! That would be a criminal act. Where I practice it would be a felony punishable by 2-10 years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine. If you look at a marriage application it will often have the disclaimer telling you why not to lie on it and how screwed you might be if you do. Do a Google search and you will find easily. Would also be grounds for annulment of marriage depending on the circumstances.
