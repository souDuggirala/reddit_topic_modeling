 OPs Dad is a fucking moron.  OP says he's going back to his country, so I'm taking it as OP knowing he's going to England Canada? They even sent the conscientious objectors to Iraq back. . . [removed] I've noticed that some of the poster here are saying that England has an extradition treaty. But what if the father knows this and isn't going there? I guess calling the investigators is the only step left..... Let the police know he’s planning on fleeing. If he’s under investigation they can confiscate his passport.  You can contact the investigators and let them know he is planning to flee the country. They may be able to prevent him from leaving. Pretty sure the investigation is still going on. If not, then it’s over and done with and they’re just doing their thing with the info they have I guess.  Has he been formally charged? Has he been arraigned and granted bail?  So he's going to flee to...England...to avoid his charges. England, known for its extremely friendly extradition to the US. I'm sure that'll end well. Not really. The UK will extradite to America. That's probably the last place I would run to escape the US justice system. Is it true that he could just leave to avoid his charges? That’s one of the most cowardly things possible... There's no legal mechanism to accomplish that. Sorry. He can't be forced to "own up to his mistakes", although he could get convicted of a crime.  I guess for him to not be a coward and own up to his mistakes. I don’t really believe he’s gonna do that without force, though.  What is it that you are hoping will happen here?
