 So let's say I wanted to write a book set in the distant future on Earth, and directly reference a piece of literature from modern times. Like let's say I wanted to name a character The Lorax, maybe even include the line "I am The Lorax and I speak for the trees", all in direct and explicit reference to Dr. Seuss' The Lorax. Like, the book itself would be talked about within the story as some relic from the past. Sorry if this is a dumb question, but is this legal? That would absolutely violate copyright law. You are allowed to reference characters and other copyrighted material for various ‘fair use’ purposes - critique, comment, news reporting, instruction, etc - or for use in parody productions. What you are describing is a derivative work. You can only create such a work if you receive a license from the copyright owner or if the work has entered the public domain.
