 I was the sole passenger of a lyft that was on its way from doing a work related errend and we got side swiped. Nobody was hurt and my driver as well as the two occupants of the other car were out talking. I was sitting in the car unsure what to do. They swapped info and I believe my driver went straight in a left turn lane that most people also go straight in. I'm pretty sure he will be found at fault but are there any measures I should take or anything I have to do in this situation? then you don't have to do anything Alright, thank you. Nope Unless you are planning to file a claim, then you have nothing to worry about or do unless they want testimony or have questions about the accident. are you hurt in any way?
