 Situation: Girlfriend and I broke up. House is 100% in my name, we have no agreement about co-owning, etc. My names is on all the bills etc. We’re in a legal dispute over the property (she thinks she’s entitled to half) so she is refusing to leave until it’s resolved which could take months. How do I evict? How do I give her 30 days, or whatever? Thanks! Just Google California notice of vacate form. Theres several of them to choose from that will suffice. It does not need to be notorized. Also if she has been there more than a year looks like it requires a 60 day notice. Post it on her door, both to her bedroom and the main entrance. Take a picture with a timestamp.  Should be able to just google “(state/city) landlord tenant laws”). It’s usually written notice, then legal filing, then law enforcement escort if needed. This is assuming she is NOT on the title or mortgage, you have no written agreements, and are not married. I am not a lawyer and I believe California has strict tenancy laws, so check carefully or get a quick lawyer consult.  How do I do that properly? Is there a form, or specific language? Does it need to be notarized? I’ve never had to do this before. Give your ex a written 30 day notice to vacate.  Where/how do I start this process? No. He has to follow his local laws as though she is a tenant. I dunno? Never had to do this before. She’s not so much trespassing as she’s refusing to move out. If you own everything and there's documentation, couldn't you just phone the police for trespassing?
