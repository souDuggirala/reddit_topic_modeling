 I know you’ve seen the tear jerking videos of people surprising their step parent with adoption papers. I am 31 and my step dad is everything a child could ever ask for in a dad and more for stepping up to be there for me always and treating me like I am no different than if I were his own blood. For Father’s Day this year I want to surprise him with adoption papers. I’ve done some research, but want to go to a lawyer prepared with anything extra I need. Just wanting to know if anybody has gone through the process and can tell me what steps I need to take exactly.
