 Hi, I own a home with my husband and mil. My husband and mil are the financial providers and are funding the mortgage/applied for the loan. I am unemployed but I signed the Deed of Trust. The title lady and the realtor both assured me Iâ€™d be on the Deed as well. I just checked our Deed and my name is not listed as an owner. Is it possible the title company messed up?
