 Sorry if it's the wrong sub. We had a bring your kids to work day today, people who brought kids were allowed to leave earlier (around 11 am) than people who didn't bring kids, they were allowed to leave 3 hours before their regular sign off time. This seems like blatant discrimination to me, can I complain/do anything about it? Are you all salaried - that is, are the people who left early getting paid for those hours? But honestly we're talking about 3 hours on one of the quietest business days of the year (unless you're retail) - while you could complain to management it's really not worth your while to get a rep as a grinch.
