 My longtime friend confided in me that when he was in his late teens he developed some friendships online with people who were struggling through some issues he was facing as well (parental abuse, etc). From what he's said to me it sounds like the people he was friends with enjoyed roleplaying and they had sexual conversations with each other several times as a form of escapism. My friend realized too late that what he was doing was wrong and cut contact with the people last year - he's 23. He's done a lot of research and knows that what he did was not only morally wrong but illegal as well. He's trying to come to terms with what he did and why he did it and wants to try the counseling services our university offers. He's really afraid that he will end up being turned in to law enforcement by the counselors. Is there any way he can start taking responsibility for his actions and move on with his life? He's in a much better place now, but from what he's told me he is plagued by guilt and shame and he hates himself for what he did thinking it was just a silly way to escape life for a while. Wouldn't taking responsibility for his actions also involve accepting that having sexual conversations with a minor has legal repercussions?
