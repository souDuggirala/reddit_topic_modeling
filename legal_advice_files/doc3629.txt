 I am in the process of filing for a wage garnishment again a previous employer and one of the forms as asking me to supply the interest rate that the outstanding balance will be increased by if not paid. I have a judgement against them that lists the total amount but nothing that mentions the rate if there were to be no payment. The official text is as follows: The amount of the outstanding balance on the judgment or order, including accrued interest and allowable costs, is (9) $10,000. Interest accrues at the rate of (10) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ % per (11) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. The cost of serving the Writ of Garnishment will be shown on the Affidavit of Service and may be added to the Judgment along with allowable costs. Is there some type of public standard rate out there that would be used in the event it is not explicitly mentioned?  In my state, the state supreme court issue a tax rate in an opinion at the beginning of each new year.  The garnishment doesn't list this information, I read it multiple times. The only thing that mentions interest rates are as follows: Pursuant to A.R.S. 23-360, an employer who fails to pay the wages found to be owed within ten (10) days after this order becomes final is liable to pay the employee an amount which is equal to treble the amount of unpaid wages, namely an amount of $11,400 which shall be subject to interest at the legal rate. This doesn't tell me the interest rate % or the timeframe that is needed for the garnishment papers. It will be the rate set by your state. In my state, every year the state supreme court issues an opinion stating what the judicial interest rate on judgments will be for that year. It's likely on your judgment.
