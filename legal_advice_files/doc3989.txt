 Hey all, My parents are new homeowners and recently bought their first home 2 years ago in Kentucky. However, recently, a man came by their door and convinced them to get their roof repaired along with several of our neighbors. Everything was going well until we realized the carpet by the chimney was wet one day, and after talking to our insurance inspector, they said might be roof. We tried calling the company and their phones are disconnected and can't get a hold of them at all. They aren't even at their address. So two things, if our roof collapses, are we covered even though we weren't aware of said scam at the time? Second, is there anything at all we can do? After some research, looks like the guy had had been in prison and is on parole, but can't seem to get more info than that. Parents are super stressed and this has been a crappy situation all around. I appreciate any and all help.  The company isn’t shut down, looks like he’s just made it so that he’s not reachable. Also, since he’s an ex convict, would it make sense to call the sheriffs office to notify them to see if they suggest any actions?  't aware of said scam at the time? Most insurance policies cover sudden disasters, but not always when they're only due to poor workmanship. You can ask your insurer in advance, but I would read your policy documents very carefully. If the company is shut down and has no money, then there's nothing to sue for. You can see if you can track down any insurance that they had that might cover this, either from the individual themself (unlikely) or potentially through your state's licensing board.
