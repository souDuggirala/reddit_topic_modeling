 So my kids ages almost ten and almost eleven, have begged me incessantly every visit not to go back to Mom's. I have a laundry list of contempt of courts on her. She violates with blatant disregard every iota of the decree and parenting plan. Her situation is less than ideal and has her family members around our kids all the time. She comes from a destitute family and they are drug users and burdens of society. I'm not going to go into detail on purpose for vagueness, but my children are no longer in a safe situation again. I'm going to file an emergency custody order first thing tomorrow morning and get them enrolled in school. Their mother and I are living in different states. Five years of manipulation and lies and brainwashing our kids and I'm done with it. What should I know? What should I expect? Thanks in advance! Yup. I'm going to seek a modification with the emergency custody order. Is there a current custody order in place? You should expect a big battle. Also I don't recommend enrolling them in school unless you have sole educational decision making authority in your court order. These types of cases really need an attorney. Start calling around first thing tomorrow
