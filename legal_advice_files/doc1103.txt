 I work at a payday loan place, and my boss is asking me to call every reference on every past due account multiple times a week. I'm holding her off with refusing to call anyone but the actual person who borrowed money from me more than once a week. I can't find any laws regarding the references - people you put on the application to call if the company can't get a hold of you. Is there any kind of harassment law I can cite to get her to back off? I try really, really hard to be the one place people can go to that will be transparent with them and treat them like people.  I just want to THANK YOU for NOT calling those people. They don't owe you anything. You are a hero.
