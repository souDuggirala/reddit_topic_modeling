  We had a court hearing on Monday set by the court in a civil case (debt collector). I the defendant filed and sent the plaintiff a request for Production, Admission and Interrogatories in March, the plaintiff asked for additional 60 days to answer. The plaintiff did not answered to any request and after 8 months the court set a date for a hearing. At the hearing the plaintiff asked for 10 more days to get documents from his client, the judge denied the motion for the 10 day extension. The judge also told the plaintiff "the defendants request for Admission are deemed admitted ". So far the plaintiff only provided me with credit card statements from when they originally filed this lawsuit. What should be my next move ? Do I wait and see what the plaintiff will do next ? Do I file motions and what kind of motions ? Thank you so much for any advise
