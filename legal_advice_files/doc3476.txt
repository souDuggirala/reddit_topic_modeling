 Hi, so I've been going to tournaments for a video game and recently learned about public performance copyright laws applying to video games as well. I was wondering if simply attending a tournament that doesn't have a public performance license is illegal or not. I'm in Florida, and the tournaments are in the Jacksonville area. Probably still on the organizers, not the participants. Let me re-phrase that, not just attending but participating. I thought it might involve contributory copyright laws, but I'm no lawyer.  Okay, I was concerned because it's not like a movie where you're simply watching. You are playing the game.   't have a public performance license is illegal or not. No. The license is the tournament organizers' problem, not the attendees'.
