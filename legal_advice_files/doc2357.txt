 I was driving in Florida and got a speeding ticket in my brother's car. The problem is the ticket is in my brother's name, not mines. I believe since we have similar names the officer mistakenly but his name instead of mine. He is mad and doesn't want the ticket on his name, can I fight this and put it under my name instead. sorry for the bad punctuation. thanks will do Thank you for the advice NAL. You have the option for a court date on the ticket, use it. When you go to court, bring your brother (since his name is on ticket). Tell the judge that the officer wrote the ticket up incorrectly. Judge will probably throw the case out since ticket was incorrect. Your brother can also argue that his name should (at the very least) be removed so he doesnâ€™t incur any penalties / record for a mistake the cop made.  You should go to court and tell the DA the ticket is in the wrong name and it should be dropped altogether.
