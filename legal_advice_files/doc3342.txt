 As title states, what happens in a divorce resulting from the non-working significant other cheating? My biggest question is, would the working SO, that was cheat on, have to pay alimony/spousal support, even though non-working SO was at fault? Also, are assets split evenly? Would the working partner being male or female have effects on the answer? Notes: just make general assumptions here, no-prenup, married man and wife, two young children. One partner works. One partner at home with kids. That's unanswerable. It depends on how fault is found. Just because someone cheated doesn't mean they'll get fucked in a divorce and walk away with nothing. In fact, that's almost unheard of it's so wildly rare.  I don't know the specifics, but I would suspect it's related to the general societal shift in attitudes to sexual mores. [deleted] Most places have moved to a no-fault divorce system, so unfortunately infidelity doesn't factor into the decision. Most of the financial decisions will look at the standard of living set during the marriage. Minnesota doesn't do fault based divorces so that's not going to count for much. You could try it in ND, but it's a horrible, long process that both parties often regret in the end.  Family laws are state specific. The answer to this question depends entirely on the state this happens in.
