 My TTP global entry application is on hold and in order to get approved I need to provide the CBP office with documents relating to my criminal case (arrested, I was mistakenly identified as a suspect, released, no charges filed). An online search (I searched for case number by my name and a 4-year filing parameter) of my county's court system returned nothing! What do I do? Thanks!
