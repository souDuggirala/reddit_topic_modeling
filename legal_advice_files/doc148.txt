 I have a legal question. My ex-wife and I bought furniture a year before we divorced. It was not written into the divorce (I made a lot of mistakes durning the divorce, mainly due to trusting her). She stopped making payments on some furniture, and I got a collection letter. The furniture is in my name. I contacted her, who now lives in another state, via text and she stated in the text that she contacted them and everything is in her name now. Again, I was dumb and believed her. Now, I just got a summons where I'm being sued for the full amount. I still have the texts she sent saying it's her responsibility. I cannot get hold of her and would like to know what my legal options, if any, are. Thank you... Who has the furniture? You're welcome and good luck. Thank you You can only file in the state where the damage occurred. Suing someone out of state depends on where you are, some states will allow it but some won't. Depending on the amount you're trying to recover, it may or may not worth your time, effort and money to get an attorney if you can't do it in small claims court. Where does one file a small claims if the other person is in a different state? If your name is still on the bill, then you are legally the owner of the debt. See if you can work out a payment plan with the collection agency and plan on paying the bill. Save the text and check your local small claims court and see if it would allow you to sue someone out of state since the damages occurred in your current state.
