 I was rear ended in early December while on the clock and went to the emergency room for neck and back pain. Was given a prescription and sent home after a few hours. Waited almost a week after not receiving any follow up information and returned to the emergency room with the pain having become much more severe. I was later contacted by the case worker and told I should not have returned to the emergency room and should have contacted them for follow up information. I finally received a follow up appointment after Christmas and was given a return to work slip and another prescription which my pharmacist refused to fill due to an interaction with another medicine I had already been prescribed and causes seizures. I scheduled an appointment with my personal doctor after still not receiving any follow up information and they suggested I request a new case worker. I have spoken with a lawyer and he claims he will contact them personally after today where I have still yet to receive any follow up appointments or details. I am unsure of what to do in this situation and am very uncomfortable with how Iâ€™ve been treated so far. If anyone could please give me some advice on this matter I would be grateful
