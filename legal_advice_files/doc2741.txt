 I very recently checked my credit report and was very surprised to see a credit account open since 2007 under my name and ssn. I've never had a credit card and I would have been 17 in 2007, yet it reflects over 100 on time payments of a $0.00 balance and yet is apparently helping my credit score? Do I have some sort of dormant identity leech or what's up with that? It said the most recent payment of $0 was this month.  I hadn't considered that someone may have been looking out for me.  Ask your parents if they got a card in your name. They may have built you credit history intentionally and forgot to tell you. If not, you'll have to dispute it with the credit reporting bureau. File a dispute with a credit reporting agency (Equifax, trans union). It doesnâ€™t necessarily sound like identify theft to me, probably just a mix up which happens all of the time especially if you have a common name. The fact that they got your social security correct is concerning though.
