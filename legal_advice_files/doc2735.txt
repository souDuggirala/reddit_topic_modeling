 I guess I am not good at looking for real lawyers. I know I need an attorney but how do I find them. I hold a CDL for work and I don't want to lose it, I am the sole provider for my family. This is in Texas, city of Corrigan is who issued the warrant. The reason for the ticket was driving too fast by a parked police car. (I was driving 10 mi under the speed limit on a busy highway, speed limit 45. There is a new law that you must be going 20 under while passing emergency vehicles.) Thank you for any advice you can give me. Call the lawyer you originally had and find out what happened. Call the lawyer and ask him WTF?
