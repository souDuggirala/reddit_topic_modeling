 If my ex's lawyer is a mediator, can I contact her and have her act as our mediator?  You can ask for a mediation process, yes. This doesn't necessarily mean you drop your lawyers; mediation might fail. It could mean you go to mediation without lawyers though.  Am I allowed to suggest to my ex we drop lawyers and go through a mediator?  More context is needed, but generally speaking if an attorney has represented one party they will be ethically prohibited from serving as a mediator for that party and another adverse party.
