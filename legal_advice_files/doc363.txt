 Hi, I'm an Etsy seller. I draw and sell celebrity portraits using vector graphics. Personally, I thought this was legal, as long as I added my own style to it. I got one of my listings removed due to IP infringement, and this made me rethink my position. I've been in eCommerce for a while now without much success and I finally see some traction with this project, but I can't help to feel a bit worried about potential legality issues. \- Where does the line go between legal artwork and copyright/intellectual property infringement? \- Can I use a celebrity's name in my artwork listings? \- Am I risking a lawsuit by drawing and selling celebrity portraits? I really appreciate any help clarifying this issue.  It’s not a copyright issue (unless it’s copied from a photo) - it’s a right of publicity/personality issue, insofar as you’re using their image for commercial gain. US law is extremely variable on the subject (competing first amendment/free speech rights versus assorted state-based publicity rights), and I’ve no idea about Norway. The general rule is that the closer you get to “fine art,” the more favorable US courts will treat you. The likelihood of US-based celebrities/lawyers suing you is low - it’d be hard to recover damages and it’s a lot easier to send a series of takedown notices - but it’s within the realm of possibility.
