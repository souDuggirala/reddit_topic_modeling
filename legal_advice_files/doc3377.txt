 I rented a vehicle. When I first got it, the customer service agent never provided me a damage inspection form and when I asked, at first he claimed there was no damage on it and no need to get a form. After I insisted, he finally gave it to me. There were a lot of scratches, dents, pings, and even hail damage. I notated all damage on the inspection form and took photos which included scratches on one of the tire rims (the driver right side tire) After I drove off, a few days later, in the sunlight I saw a few vertical cracks and a little nick in one the tire and scratches on the tire rim that were much less than the one I had seen on the other tire during inspection. This was the right side passenger tire. I obviously missed it during the initial inspection. All of the tires had very worn tread, in fact it was bigger than the width of my middle finger. Even though I had proof of scratches on the rim of one of the tires before renting, I figured if I said anything about the tire when I dropped it off, the rental car company would of course try to charge me for it because we all know how rental car companies work and that damage claims bring in prob most of their money and theyre notorious for these claims being scams. During the drop off inspection, they did not notate the cracks in the tires or the nick. On the one hand, I didn't want to say anything in case I was blamed for it and forced to pay but on the other hand, I think that they should be aware so that whoever rents it henceforth isn't going to get a blowout. I'm not sure what the ethical or legal way to proceed is.
