 A stranger I helped move was evicted and the apartment building we live in is going to throw out everything that was left in the apartment. I know a bit about evictions and most of the time they get the county sheriff and a crew to just move all the stuff out of the property. Is this different because itâ€™s an apartment? It just seems not 100% correct to me.  The location is entirely relevant
