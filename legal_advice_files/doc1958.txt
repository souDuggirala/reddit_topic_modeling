 There's a huge gap in my employment now because of an open heart surgery I had back in September, so I feel like I have to explain what happened to employers. It has felt like a lot of employers have been afraid of hiring me because of it (I work in sales). Interviews that I have typically breezed through and have received offers have gone cold. One guy even asked me if I could handle the stress of a sales job again because of my heart. This seems like a red flag. I'd love to just not bring it up, I know I technically don't have to, but then I have no way of explaining this huge gap in my employment which looks really bad. I'm trying to find some middle ground as to what I can do in this situation, but I'm at a loss. Any help is greatly appreciated. I'm trying my best to get back on my feet, and i've got a lot of new medical bills to pay I'm getting later on every month. My condition is congenital and very independent from the lifestyle I live, but employers seem to still not want to take the risk.  Say you were building a school in South America. Instead of explaining the heart surgery try to be more vague with it. And Iâ€™m not sure but that really does sound like discrimination against you as well.
