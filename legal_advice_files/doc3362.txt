 Step-Father arrested (CA) for continuous sex abuse of a child (another family member). Step-father will likely bail out of jail and my mother is scared for her safety and that he will try and return to the home that they both own. Is there anything my mom can do to keep him away from her or the property? I’d also like to note, their is a marriage dissolution in progress. The child is his granddaughter whom would frequent the house with my mother. As part of the bail there may be a stipulation regarding where he can live, say, if that minor had residence or partial residence there. If that is his house and the affected child is not living there he would have access to his own home. Your mom will need to work with her divorce attorney regarding residence for him. No, but that is not what I asked. If the answer is no, then that would have been an acceptable answer. Has he done something to her? Yeah, she will definitely do so. I was just wondering if she has any grounds for a restraining order based on the accusations. She should review with her lawyer to see if anything can be done. For the most part it’s his property too until/unless it becomes otherwise in the dissolution. And he has an equal right to access it.
