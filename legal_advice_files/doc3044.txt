 I became a citizen of the US early this year and did a name change that was approved. It was very simple, let's say my old name was Sara Belle Davis Parker and I changed it to Sarah Marie Davis Parker. When I got my driving license in CT, I just used Sara Parker, I have two last names but I never bothered to put my full name on any documents. I am seeing now that I made a mistake. When I went to the DMV to update my information, I was told they could not help me because my name change order reflected two last names while my license only had one. According to that, it was technically a new identity. They told me I needed a court order saying that I was changing my last name from Parker to Davis Parker. I don't know if this belongs here but I didn't know where else to ask. How would I go about doing this? Do I go back to the courthouse where I had my ceremony and ask them to give me a new document? I already have one reflecting my proper name, this would just be for the DMV's benefit? Thank you please.
