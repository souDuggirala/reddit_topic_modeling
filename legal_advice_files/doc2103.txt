 A friend of mine has a form in front of me that I am being told she has to sign regarding her employment. She works at a bar, and the rules are pretty vanilla. They are paraphrased below. 1. Don’t use excessive force. 2. Cannot use weapons under any circumstances. 3. Call “911” immediately if anything happens. 4. Separate the violent parties as best you can until the authorities arrive. Question is, how enforceable are these against employees? She’s being told that this is for insurance purposes, but this bar has been known in the past to have problems with drunk and disorderly folks. Location is CA. Thanks.  She can be fired for not following them, wether she signs the form or not.
