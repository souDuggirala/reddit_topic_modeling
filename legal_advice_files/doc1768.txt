 Hi r/legaladvice I'm curious to know if I can legally use an image taken in a grocery store with cereal boxes etc. in it on a website I've made? The website is for a brand to do with environmental food branding, hence I'm concerned that there may be a misrepresentation of the products in the image. I took the photograph. Cheers!
