 With the FDA recently granting psilocybin "breakthrough therapy" designation for clinical depression (essentially that means it has the potential to be better than existing treatments available today), I'd like to to try them for my treatment resistant depression. I'm wondering if it's safe to tell my psychiatrist of my plans. Where I live, possessing them (in Nevada, USA) is a felony. I know about doctor-patient confidentiality. But I also know there are exceptions to said confidentiality. Would this still fall under the umbrella of doctor-patient confidentiality?  Listen it’s a bad idea to use them. But likely you are going to do it anyhow. Tell them. Why? They are going to affect how your other medications work. That interaction could be very bad and you may find yourself on the locked unit with no memory and a police charge when you wake up. So be honest so he can make a good informed decision on your medications. Patients tell us they use drugs. We ask because we need to know. You use cocaine? I’m not running that IV wide open. I need to know you took viagra before I order drugs for your chest pain. This is a need to know thing because the mushrooms and your depression medications affect your brain. We don’t call the cops. We aren’t cops. We will call CPS if you have a kid and you do because it makes you impaired if there is a emergency. We won’t let you drive home if impaired. If you want a good relationship with him be honest. At the most he may say he won’t see you if you use them. He’s definitely going to try to talk you out of using them. Seriously he went to tons of school and training to do what he does. He’s a expert. Don’t listen to Dr. Google.  I can think of a dozen ways telling could bite you in the ass. I can’t think of one reason it would benefit you to tell your Dr.  The legality of your actions is not protected by doctor-patient confidentiality.
