 So before anyone tells me, yes I know I fucked up. So a few months back, I started texting this girl who I believed was over the age of 18 but didn't ask for her age at the beginning. As we talked, there were occasions in which the messages became sexual in nature (No pictures, videos, or anything of that sort). One time we got in an argument and when I tried to stop talking to her, she told me that she is only 15 and that she would go to the police with our previous messages if I didn't keep talking to her. So I agreed but told her that we could only talk as friends and nothing more. This worked for awhile until today, which she decided to try and extort me for money in exchange for deleting the messages and I don't know how to proceed from here. I would think that her admitting to extorting me would be just as bad as what I did and that she wouldn't try to go to the police out of fear of being involved in a situation where she could be charged as well. But since she is a minor, I would assume that she would basically get off with probation and nothing more. I also don't want to give her any money because she could just come back and keep asking for more. I also believe that she would actually go to the police with the messages if I don't go through with it. I am also not in a position in which I could afford a lawyer because I am only a college student(21 years old if that matters) so any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks I have met this person in real life It's a very popular scam. Your "girl" is actually a 48 year old guy in Nigeria or Albania. Block and move on.
