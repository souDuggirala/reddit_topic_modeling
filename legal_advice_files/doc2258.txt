 I got in a car accident about 6 months ago, and had a surgery next day. Since I was uninsured, (non-profit) hospital I was treated in provided 100% financial assistance to me. I had no idea that ER, anesthesia and radiology departments are billed separately, therefore couple weeks ago I started receiving phone calls from debt collectors. ER and radiology turned in the financial assistance letter from the hospital and the issues with those collectors resolved. But today I was informed that now is too late for me to provide the letter from the hospital, because that bill is owned by collectors and I have to deal with them. Those collectors didn't give me any options to reduce the bill, or pay in parts, they want the full sum (it's about $2000, but I'm too broke even for that) right away and also threatening to sue me. My questions are: What do I say to them next time they call? Obviously, I don't want to pay anything, is such outcome even possible? Thank you for reading. I will appreciate any advice/help. P.S. I don't really remember mails from debt collectors, because I had a lot of bills coming all the time, but most definitely they sent me something. I already feel super stupid for not taking care of it in time (the financial assistance letter literally said I'm 100% covered, and even all my doctor appointments and all physical therapy was free after, so I just ignored all billing mails).  I could negotiate it with other collectors, but they actually resolved. The only remaining one doesn't want to negotiate and asks only for payment in full. Try to negotiate a payment plan.
