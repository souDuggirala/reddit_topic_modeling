 My former stepbrother sent my ex girlfriend a Facebook message back in September letting her know that he had her only copy of her Social Security card and birth certificate at their house. We accidentally left it behind when my mother, brother and I moved out of the house back in April. Since then, we have both made multiple attempts to message him and set up an arrangement to come get them. He has seen every message that has been sent, but has been radio silent otherwise. My ex starts a new job soon and needs both of these documents within the next week or so. Yesterday we left a note in the mailbox, asking if they could just leave the documents there and I’d pick them up after work. Today the mailbox was empty and no documents were there. At this point, what are our options? We have all of the messages saved, so we can prove they are keeping her things there and making no attempt to communicate with us. Would we be able to involve the sheriff given that they live out in the township? We didn’t want things to come to this, but they’ve given us no other options. Your options are - Go to your county records office and request a copy of her birth certificate ( assuming she was born in ohio ). Go to your local SS office and request a new SS card. You might have to pay extra to expedite the process since she is going to start the new job soon. The former stepbrother has no fiduciary duty to store your forgotten belongings. Back in september he was probably more than happy to help out, now we are in january and he might have thrown all your stuff away 2 months ago, and there is nothing illegal about that.
