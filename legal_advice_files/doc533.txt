 A cop/detective and two people knocked on my door, I answered the door and was immediately scared and attempted to close the door and she said “if you close that door I’ll go get a -“ and I opened the door and said “what?” And was bombarded with questions about locations of people whom I’ve never heard in my life. I told them frantically it was just me and my 2 siblings here. She replied with “I can see that” looking through one of my windows where my siblings were. A women who was not a cop and another man showed me pictures of several girls with Snapchat filters who I’ve never seen/met in my life. It was enough for them to apologize and leave. All the names of the people they asked about I had no clue who they were or where they were. Should I be worried about them coming back? Sorry if this is hard to piece together I’m really shook up. Sounds like they're looking for someone and are canvassing the area. Had that happen here (just one cop and not as rough about it) when they were trying to find a girl a couple years ago.
