 Location: USA, California I want to get my name changed (for many reasons) but I know in California it costs about $500 just to have it filled. I also plan on getting married next year, so I was wondering if there’s a way to change my first and middle name along with my last name when I get married. I tried googling it but didn’t really find any concrete answers. Besides a few people saying they did change their middle name when they got married. So basically is it legal to change your full name when you get married? Or do you still have to file it and have the court appearance to change your full name?  My wife did.
