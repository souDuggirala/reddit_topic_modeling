 My mother is unemployed and she can’t pay back my student loan. I’m in between jobs but I’ll resume paying soon. Can a debtor garnish my fathers wages just because she’s his spouse? His name is not associated with the loan at all. Has anyone heard of this happening. The reason I need this information is because he refuses to give his information to the loan company because he thinks that makes him liable. I’m just trying to moVe things along so that my mother doesn’t stay in default on the loan and so that her co-signer doesn’t have to be financially responsible. Thank you.  Parents seldom listen to their kids for advice. It's a generational thing.  Thank you, I knew this but he’s not the one to listen.  It doesn't make him liable if he's not contractually obligated on the loan.
