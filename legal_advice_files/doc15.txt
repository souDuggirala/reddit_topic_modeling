 My school has two main parking colors, yellow outlines for staff and white outlines for everyone with a student parking pass/temporary paid pass. Behind the Olympic pool there is 3 white lined parking spots that say Maintenance. There are signs posted all around the structures saying not to park in yellow outlined staff parking. So my question is, can I park in Maintenance? And before its asked where will Maintenance park as a moral question, they park in the actual numerous yellow staff parking spots right next to their building I have never seen them use these spots in the 2 years I've been here unless there's pool trouble. Today I received a parking ticket for using these spots for the first time, is it valid if it's not one of their yellow designated staff marked spots? This is in California. What law were you cited as violating? So is the reason for this because of the painted "maintainence" under it? Are there state laws around it? I ask because every other spot is yellow side parking lot spots, with signs citing parking in yellow spots is punishable, and that student parking is white outline parking only. Even the spots for the dean, president etc all have the above. These 3 spots have no signs and white outlines like the student parking spots. If you aren’t in Maintenance, you can’t park in those spots. They may be open for deliveries or contractors.
