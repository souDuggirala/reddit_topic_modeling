 Pretty much as title explains, I got a ticket in PA for running a stop sign. I paused/slowed, but didn’t come to a complete stop, no denying it. Officer explained how the ticket works and said it would be 3 points on my license and a fine. I told him I would plead guilty (stupid I know), since I knew I messed up and don’t want to lie about it. Ticket is $150 which sucks, but not impossible to afford. Just wondering if there’s something I should/can do to get it reduced or keep points off my license? If I get the points will it mess with my insurance? The cop said if I plead not guilty at court I would probably get the points removed. Just not sure if the price of a lawyer and court fees would be worth it? I always get an attorney, he keeps stuff off my record/lowers fines/keeps points off ect. I don’t know if running a stop sign is as big a deal as speeding though.  You can plead no-contest and ask the magistrate to withhold the points if you have a decent driving history. Then your insurance rates may not go up. You don’t need a lawyer for this, just a day off work to show up at the courthouse on your hearing date.  Just plead not guilty. The court usually lowers it to just a fine. You do not want points on your license, even just a fine can raise your insurance. You can talk to a paralegal about this but you probably don’t need a lawyer when you go to court.  You have no defense. This is the penalty. Pay it and pay more attention when you drive.
