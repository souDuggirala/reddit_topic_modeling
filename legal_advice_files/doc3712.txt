 Location TX Okay this is long. And this is a throw away account ... also Maybe confusing but definitely stupid on my part for trusting family. I had a vehicle loan. My mother was the primary and I was co-signer.. earlier this year my mom went bankrupt so this loan fell on me... Which is fine.. she got the car for me.. i was paying it not her... Me and husband are trying to save and i was looking to get rid of the car payment.. so my cousin agreed to take the car and pay.. which he did for a while..he paid me - i paid the bank.. Fast forward a few months... he started becoming behind started not hearing from him... his wife started communication with me and paid me ... late but was starting to pay.. long story short It was repoed last night. $56 was due in sept still.. oct nov and now officially dec... I don’t wanna get into what i need to do about my cousin owing me money I’m looking for advice on what i need to do on my end Will it impact me significantly on my credit? And legal actions? Does it matter that I’m just the co-signer or still the same impact? Honestly don’t know what I’m trying to ask I’m so pissed but would appreciate any advice Tl;dr Repoed car i am a co-signer on.. what impact does it have since I’m a co-signer and primary is bankrupt.  Exactly this.  Your credit will be damaged significantly with a repossession on it. You can try and contact the bank and see if you can pay off the car or get it current, but your credit is probably already pretty damaged since you have to miss a few payments to get a car repossessed. Still, fixing the repossession is better than not. If you cannot afford to deal with it the bank will sell the car and you will owe whatever is left between the sale price and the loan.  This will definitely impact your credit, just as much as if you were the primary signer.
