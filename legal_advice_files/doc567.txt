 Hey! Long story but I’m an Assistant principal at a public school. Before I was hired the HR director and Super asked me some questions that had negative racial implications. Like “I heard you said this” and THIS would make me a racist. I denied it. Never said it. They said they wouldn’t investigate. Few weeeks later. Bring me back in. HR director says “if it looks like duck quacks like a duck it’s a duck” calling me a racist. The year since they continue to Persecute me, ignore their own policies etc. I’ve gotten lawyer but lawyer says I should just settle and resign. What do you all think?? Sorry. Not trying to divulge all the details. INFO Bro this is the the long version of your story? I don't even know what's going on. Except that maybe English isn't your first language. Even though I’ve done nothing wrong? Just curious.  That you should listen to your lawyer.
