 Hey guys, I am having an issue with this bloke who I dealt with recently. To paint the picture lightly, I bought second hand parts off of him from Facebook, made payment and confirmed that the items will be posted in the next two days. Three weeks later the bloke keeps making excuses as to why he has not posted them and I had enough. I posted on similar facebook groups calling him out and explaining my side. This reached hundreds ANd the guy I bought from. He posted with an attack too and now wants to get a solicitor involved for "defamantion of character". Still no word on any of the parts however.. Im stumped as to where to proceed from here. Thanks mate! I see! Thanks for the advice, it should be all good then  He’s very unlikely to want to pursue a case of defamation anywhere in Australia, given the costs involved. As long as what you posted is true as far as you’re aware, and you haven’t posted details that are untrue and / or irrelevant, it’s unlikely that this will go any further. If you’re contacted by a solicitor, or FaceBook, speak to Legal Aid in your state or territory for some advice. Contact your credit card provider, bank or online payment system about the fact that you haven’t received goods you’ve paid for. You can also contact the relevant Consumer Affairs department in your state or territory.  Defamation applies if the statements you made were untrue. As long as what you said is factual or an opinion you are fine.
