 My husband passed (Intestate, not in Probate) June 17, 2018. He has five children, we had three and two oldest are from a previous (all are over the age of 18). The only thing my husband owned was a vehicle, and the miscellaneous items left behind in the Mistress's apartment. After the 40 day waiting period, I went to the DMV with the DC filled out the required forms, just to find out the car was already transferred into the Mistress's name. My next move is to forward a Demand Letter, unless I can be advised something different with effective results. The 40 day required waiting period has been violated (Title transferred one week after date of death). I suspect the act of conversion, forgery providing false info to the DMV took place. Her first defense was that his mom gave her the car (his mom is not on the Title), and her second defense is that he signed the car over to her while in the hospital (my husband was heavily sedated the entire time), how shall I approach this situation. What are my options?  Probably the best thing to do would be to file the paperwork for handling small estates with the court: []() This would give you the right to act on behalf of your husband's estate, and put you in position to obtain the car, sell it, and distribute the proceeds accordingly to all the heirs. From a quick read of DC law, you'd get 50%, and all the kids would split the other half (so they would get 10% each). Unless all the kids decided to just let you have the car, anyway. Would you happen to know if there are any particular forms that I need to have filed and served in order to begin the process of obtaining this property? [removed] You need to consult a civil attorney, perhaps one specializing in elder law. Even if your husband was not elderly, similar laws would apply if she forged his name or coerced him to sign something while in the hospital.
