Hi Reddit. 

So I have narcissistic parents, always devaluating me, wondering why I have depression and telling me I can never be successful enough with my work ethic. In reality, they have been using my name in tax schemes claiming from the government my dad's business pays me a salary of 15-30k a year depending on the year to receive tax bigger tax break for my dad and this was done since I was 17 years old for the last 7 years. My parents never asked my permission for this and then started claiming I need to be paying rent, making me apply for student loans, meanwhile receiving this money on using my name. In third year of university my student loans got denied because of a slip up from my moms part of reporting my income inaccurately she forgot on paper I was actually receiving an income, this is when I first found out about this. My parents then said they will pay for my school if I don't say anything about this. So I'm wondering is it me that has a right to sue them? Or is it just something that's reportable to the CRA (canada's equivalent of IRS). Truth be told I just would like to get compensated if I was supposed to because i'm tired of the emotional abuse from my parents and I really put it on myself that I am not successful not that I was raised to put myself down. I currently hold a stable job and have an income and this would be the last year my parents use my name for this and the money that I have no clue is how much or where it goes.
