 Three of us are renting a house in West Virginia while here for work. We took the first place to answer us back cause we were coming here on short notice. When we moved in they told us the heat needed to be fixed and that it would within the month, that was October 13. They called back on the 17th of October and said they would be coming next week to fix it. They first showed up the day before Thanksgiving and still to this day haven't finished. Meanwhile the temperatures have been as low as 18 degrees here. In order to remedy the situation the landlord brought us 3 space heaters. The wiring prevents us from using all 3 heaters AND just about anything else at the same time otherwise it kicks the breaker. The one morning it was 39 degrees INSIDE the house. As a result of the heaters our electric is $228. Do we have any legal recourse? Thanks in advance. Lol I'll give ya that one. Iâ€™m sorry I have to do this COUNTRY ROADS TAKE ME HOME TO PLACE I BELONG WEST VIRGINIA...
