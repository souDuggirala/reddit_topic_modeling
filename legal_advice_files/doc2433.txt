 Hypothetical situation here. A man is shopping for a used car. He has a friend who owns a used car dealer. The man finds the car he wants from a private party online. He wants to get a loan from his bank, but they only finance purchases that are from car dealers. To circumvent this issue, the man buys the car in cash but assigns his friends car dealership as the new owner on the title. He then gets a loan from the bank and "purchases" the car from his friends dealership. The dealership gets the money from the bank, then writes a check to the man who bought the car. What do you think? So the problem comes with the friend's dealership. They're going to be putting out some costs and taking on some liability, with nothing in it to wet their beak.  It's legal. That probably adds a not-insignificant amount in fees and taxes though.
