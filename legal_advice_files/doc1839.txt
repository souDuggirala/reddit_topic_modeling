 Hi /r/legaladvice, I have a situation I've found myself in over the last few weeks. Went through the process of buying a used car from a private seller (lets call him Tom) in Texas. Car looked great, exactly what I wanted, and the seller was moving to California for work, so he was easily motivated to come down to the price I wanted. Here's where it gets a little weird. We filled out and both signed/dated the [Application for Texas Title and/or Registration (Form 130-U)]() (link to official form) and a bill of sale declaring the sale price of $1000. I then asked for the title for me to sign (expecting _his_ name in the first box). Well, apparently, he never transferred the title into his name/got the car registered under his name. He then proceeds to pull out the title, and the _original_ 130-U, signed by the original owner (lets call him John), both with NO DATES (Tom told me the original sale date was July 2016). The original purchase price was $5500. Still really wanting/needing the car, and understanding that I would probably be on the hook for the taxes on the $5500 sale at some point, I asked him to "gift" me $300, the difference between the 6.5% tax on 5500 and 6.5% tax on $1000. He left me his phone number and told me to contact him if anything didn't seem like it was going to go smooth. Well, it doesn't seem like it, because now, having the title _and_ 130-U in hand (signed, not dated, by John), it seems that Tom might be on the hook for some not light fines for [title jumping](). I've asked Tom if he could get in touch with John to possibly get him to "agree" to a purchase price of $1000, but haven't heard back from him in a couple days. So now I want to list what I think are my options... 1. Take the original 130-U and Title, signed by John, to the tax office and pay the tax on 5500 (is this fraud since John didn't _technically_ sell me the car?) 2. Alter the original 130-U to indicate a purchase price of $1000, and take that and the title, and pay the tax on what I _actually_ bought the car for (this seems more fradulent, but more appropriate? Would John get some notification about this?) 3. Destroy the title, apply for a bonded title, and paying the tax on the Standard Presumptive Value (SPV) of the car (probably in between $1000 and $5500). More info [here]() 4. Other options I haven't thought of. Thanks for the help in advance, and I'll try to respond quickly to any questions! huge pickle
