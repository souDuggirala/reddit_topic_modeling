 I just received a traffic ticket in the mail saying I ran a red light in Culver City, CA (code 22101(d)VC - Failure to obey a sign or signal), but after reviewing the video online it is clear that I did not actually run the light. I want to fight the ticket, but my only worry is if they could respond in court that I did not run the light, and instead charge me with some kind of lane violation or something else instead. Details of the video/incident: There are four lanes on the city street. Lanes 1 2 (counting from the left) are left turn only lanes and have a left turn light that is red. Lanes 3 4 are normal lanes and the light is green to go straight or turn right. My car comes into the frame in lane 2 (left turn lane), then I clearly turn on my right turn signal and merge into lane 3 to proceed straight through the intersection (there are no other cars nearby in lane 2 or 3 as I do this). I clearly did not disobey a "sign or signal," as I did not turn left on red, but my car was overlapping w/ lane 2 still as I crossed over the "stop here on red" sign while I was merging into lane 3, which is what caused the camera to go off. I am looking for answers to the following: 1) Does this sound like a lane violation or other citable offense in CA? 2) If it is, are they able to switch my citation from one thing to another (i.e., from a red light violation to lane violation) if I contest it in court?  You don't even need to get to the merits of the ticket. Los Angeles courts aren't enforcing red light tickets issued by camera. Sure, the agencies continue to send them out but the court has announced publicly that they don't report it to the DMV, they don't enforce collection and they don't issue any kind of failure to appear.
