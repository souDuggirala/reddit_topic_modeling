 As the title says I’m looking to move out of my current town where my ex and I both live to get a fresh start and get out of a small town with little to no job opportunity’s and housing. I would like to move me and my son to a bigger city that is about 30-45 minutes away and have been told by my ex that it’s too far and she won’t drive to do switches with our son. I’ve suggested meeting half way or even driving up to her when I pick him up and her doing the same when she picks up. Before I talk to an attorney about this does anyone know the distance I’m allowed to move without going back to court? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!  If it's not in your agreement specifically, there should be some language about working together for the best interests for your son. For example, your son can't attend two different schools, he has to pick one. So that would result in a rather long commute to school for the time he is with one of you. A judge may not consider that in your son's best interest. My custody agreement is pretty loosey goosey because we had been doing the same things for years without issue BUT I did add that he was responsible for travel for visitation, as he had moved a few states away. For many years I drove them and it was a pretty hard, and when they got old enough to fly he was responsible for the plane tickets. I wanted that in there because I couldn't afford tickets and he wanted to stop driving and have them fly. If you guys end up negotiating a new agreement, you may be asked to agree to provide the transport since you are the one moving.   This for the most part isn't a question of statute, but one of the terms of your parenting plan and how those terms might be interpreted by a judge. Ultimately this is a discussion with your attorney as to how the specifics of your situation and agreement may be interpreted and applied.
