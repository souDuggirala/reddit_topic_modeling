 I had a lawsuit with a previous neighbor regarding property line which I won. One of the outcomes was a court order for the neighbor to not use my property for turning around vehicles. Any guests of the neighbor were also to abide by these rules. I now have a new neighbor that uses my driveway and so do his friends and contractors. I have repeatedly told them that they have no business on my property and even called the police. Where should I go from here? The court order was regarding my previous neighbor, but it still established the rules of staying off my property. They have damaged vehicles parked on my property before and I simply want them to stay off.  Thank you Thank you Start with a cease and desist. I would also post a No Trespassing No Turning Sign. Then sue if you have to.  I would start with a simple cease and desist from your lawyer. The lawyer can add fancy words and make it all very intimidating. You've asked, they've ignored you. Now you get serious.
