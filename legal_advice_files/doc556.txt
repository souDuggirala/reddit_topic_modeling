 I just received this notification from Comcast, first time ever getting one. Lets say hypothetically I may have been torrenting and my VPN disconnected for a moment and used my actual IP for a brief time, and within minutes I had the email. It basically sums up to, the copyright owner identified me by IP and goes on about Comcast's Acceptable User Policy and that they may terminate my service. Since this is the first time I've ever gotten one of these, is this just a warning? Should I be expecting legal recourse or anything? Allegedly, I had just been torrenting season 2 of Brooklyn Nine-Nine I would imagine that's not likely to have the police knocking on my door or anything, but I wanted to ask since I'm sure plenty of people have dealt with this situation. Is this just more of "hey cut that shit out or you're gonna lose your internet"?

With Verizon, they had a "five strike" system, with the first couple having no penalty whatsoever. If I remember correctly, it was for within a two year period. Third strike, they throttled my internet for a week. It was at that point, I got my brother set up on a VPN so I'd stop getting them.
