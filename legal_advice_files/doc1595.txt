 Hi All - a close friend of mine has been working in a company in New York City for \~5 months now. She has not taken a vacation day nor a sick day yet. She has very recently come down with bronchitis and needs a day or two to recover, she's not doing well and not getting better. She's very afraid that continuing to go into the office and trek around in the winter will make her worse and could lead to really bad case of lung infection and going to the ER. The company and team culture are very rigid and heavily looks down on anyone that takes time off. She approached her superior about taking a day and the response indirectly mentioned a threat to her job security if she were to take the sick day, even though her performance reviews are very strong. Very recently, in the same team, my friend's colleague approached the boss to discuss the team morale and mentioned something about feeling uneasy with the "cut-throat" approach. She was fired the next day for "under performance" even though she had been top three in the KPI reports for several months. Another employee is on the chopping block for being in and out of the ER over the last couple of weeks due to serious health issues. These two cases only make the thread made to my friend regarding her job security if she takes the sick all the more real and possible. Is there anything she can do or anyone she can approach? Not sure if she has any legal backing if she is fired due to sickness in the city of New York, but any corporate/employee legal advice around this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advance. Yes. She can be fired for missing work. However she may qualify for FMLA of she's worked there over a year and more than 1250 hours.
