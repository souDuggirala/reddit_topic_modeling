 Myself (20) and two mates (20,27) moved into a flat about a week ago in Sydney. Before moving in she stated that everything was included and working well, such as oven and WiFi etc. However since moving into the flat the oven and WiFi has not worked once and we've had to pay extra for our data plan. We've asked several times over the past week if she can get these things sorted and she either responds saying it'll get done the next day or ignores us completely, English is her second language so it's difficult to talk to her face-to-face. I was wondering if it's legally possible to get cheaper rent for the mean time while these things are still broke or get compensated in any way whatsoever?  And call Fair Trade.
