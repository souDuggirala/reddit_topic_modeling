 Hi! I want to change my last name to my father’s last name, however he isn’t in my birth certificate. We connected later in my life at the end of high school. Will the fact that he’s not on my birth certificate pose an issue when changing my name? Thanks! That Southwest Airlines situation is fascinating to me because I know TWO people in their 30s with that name and yet I still find that name, the name only, atrocious.  Or even abcde! Crap, I was just on a thread about alcohol. Fml You can change your name as a minor with parental/guardian consent, and typically at 18/19 in most places. So that is incorrect Nope, as long as you’re over 21 you can change your name thru the courts however you want. Good luck! -Scruffy McManus  No there shouldn’t be issues (in the US). In some states you don’t need to provide a reason. You could even change your last name to “Hello-Kitty” legally if you wanted to.
