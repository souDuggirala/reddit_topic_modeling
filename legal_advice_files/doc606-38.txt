So I just had some friends that went to jail for life. There house is still under police possession for investigation purposes. And there is some stuff that I had lent to them. Now that they are going to be put away for life is there anyway I could get my stuff back? How would I go about doing it?  [removed] Does this person have a lawyer you could talk to? If the house is still under police possession after the trial/sentencing, that is unusual and suggests there's more going on (or, alternatively, that the police are going to attempt to use civil forfeiture to seize the property permanently).

If the property is worth money to you, you could also hire a lawyer of your own to file a motion with the court to have the property returned. Well once the police are done with the house your friend could have whoever is going to take possession of their property let you pick it up, that is IF he lets you. If he doesn’t then you’ll have to sue him. If the painting is less than five thousand dollars you can sue him in small claims court. It’s a painting, I lent it to him. As a friend thing I was like “one day I’ll be back for this but until then I want you to keep it. It has my signature on it. Do you have any proof of ownership/would these people say that it’s yours?
