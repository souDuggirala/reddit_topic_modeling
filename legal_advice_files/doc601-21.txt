Is there any recourse against the supermarket or the farm itself?  How would one proceed?  It sucks to have a lifelong disability after consuming a nationally recalled product.  I understand it's probably fact specific like when the lettuce was pulled from the vendor/when it was consumed.  I was hoping for some legal guidance. Thank you. There's something fishy going on.  Last time I checked, there was the E. coli responsible for the romaine lettuce outbreak (O157:H7) which isn't known to cause lifelong ulcerative colitis (but can cause things like HUS), and there is the salmonella outbreak related to beef. Don't think there was a recent salmonella outbreak regarding iceberg lettuce.  [deleted] [deleted] “Colitis” and “chronic ulcerative colitis” are not the same thing. What’s the actual diagnosis? He could try contacting a personal injury lawyer.  They would know whether he would have a case or not.
