My boyfriend \[23, Russian, MRes\] and I \[24, British, BA\] want to live in the same country as each other. This is proving harder than expected. I can't get a Russian visa, and his British student visa is expiring next month.

  
We've been searching for a country that would be easy for the two of us to move to, but we haven't had much luck yet. New Zealand, for example, would be easy for \*me\* to move to - it offers a year-long working visa for British citizens. However, for a Russian, this type of visa would not be available.

&amp;#x200B;

We were hoping that you could help us out. Are there any countries which have equally relaxed immigration laws for British citizens AND for Russian citizens? Ideally, the country would have to be English speaking, or failing that, somewhere in Europe.
