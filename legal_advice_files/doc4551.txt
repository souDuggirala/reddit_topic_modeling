 We live in Canada, my cousin was drinking and involved in a collision where a mother and her child were killed and the father is in serious condition and still in a coma. He was charged with 2 counts of criminal negligence causing death and 1 count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm. He's 18 and this is his first offence. In no way am I defending his actions I just wanted to know if anyone had a rough guess on what his jail time will be.  In theory, he's [facing up to life](). He was driving drunk and killed at least two people. I'd hope he does a hell of a lot more than six months per dead person.  Bodily Harm: Causing death: Sources: Don't have an immediate answer for you on minimum sentencing, but he needs to get the best possible lawyer for this. This is an extremely big deal.
