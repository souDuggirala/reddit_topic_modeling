 Hey r/legaladvice, Long time listener, first time caller. My wife and I are about to sign a lease stating that we must pay for professional carpet cleaning and professional cleaners prior to turning in the keys. My nonexistent knowledge of law and Googlefu powers have led me to find that landlords in Florida are responsible for normal wear and tear, and cannot charge tenants for such repairs and cleanings. My question is of the legality of this clause within the lease. Thanks for the help! Would it make you feel better to think about it as a charge to move into a place thatâ€™s had its carpets freshly cleaned? You have two options: sign the lease and accept the clause or don't sign the lease and find somewhere else. Yes landlords are responsible for wear and tear (in that they have to accept that if you live in a place carpets are going to get walked on etc) and repairs (assuming you didn't cause the damage that necessitated the repairs) but I'm not sure why you think cleaning isn't something a landlord can charge you for. And that's what this is - cleaning on move out. If you have a source that indicates that says that post move out carpet cleaning is not something that a landlord can charge for even if it's stipulated in the lease then maybe . But I haven't seen anything. If it's not mentioned in the lease carpet cleaning is generally on the landlords dime, but that's not the issue here. Live in Cali. Standard. Used to live in Florida. Standard thing.
