 I'm am trying to get health insurance on my son from a previous marriage who lives out of state. I have called health network they directed me to blue Cross blue shield. blue Cross blue shield denied due to the fact I don't claim him on my taxes and he is not a dependent and referred me to medicare. Medicare does not cover because he is not in state. Can you guys help me out on where to try next.
