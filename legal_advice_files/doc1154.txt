 Basically. I used my Jeep to do some donuts in the snow (3-4 inches) on a park soccer field. It’s not private property so I can’t get trespassing. They said I’m going to have to pay to replace the damages that I did to the field. But there isn’t much damage. What kind of penalties am I facing. Cops said court and magistrate. Nope. They just came to my house  Were you arrested or issued any citations by the police? You may very well face criminal charges, for example, of vandalism or destruction of property.
