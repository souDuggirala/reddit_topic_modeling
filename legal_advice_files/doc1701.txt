 I live in Orlando and I recently got into a minor fender bender, there was no major damage to my car besides a tiny dent to the front bumper. The other vehicle a very beat up work truck had no real visible damage to the bumper, but did have a cracked tail light, the plastic was turned white in some places but mostly intact. To me it looked like the light had been broken for some time. We exchanged drivers licences and took pictures, although he didn't ask me for my insurance and we did not file a police report. It had been 2 days and the person just texted me and said he just received a ticket for a broken tail light. I have not answered him at this time, people I have asked in my family say that he is most likely trying to scam me. I am very nervous as I don't really know what to do as I am young and this is the first time anything like this has happened to me. I would just like to know what to do or not to do from a legal standing. Thank you very much! Ya I even removed my voicemail so it's just the number. So that could work  Sounds like he’s scamming. If you say anything back to him I would say “sorry, wrong number” and wouldn’t answer again. Scam a scammer.
