 Hey all, I'd like to apply for a pistol permit, but I have a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. Nothing severe, and it's well controlled with medication. No history of institutionalization or anything like that. Is that going to prevent me from getting the permit? Thanks! Thanks, I'm just concerned because the application asks if you have a history of mental illness.  Generally if you lose firearm rights in the US it's because a court did it. I'm unaware of an anxiety disorder having any bearing on getting a firearm on its own.
