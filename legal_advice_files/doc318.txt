 On 2018-09-24 I sent a letter to their office requesting a copy of all of my medical and billing records. On November 10th, after hearing nothing, I wrote another letter, again requesting a copy of the records. November 21st I sent another letter. On December 5th I was provided with a tracking number and a few days later I received a complete copy of psychotherapy notes without any other records. These are not the records I had requested. As I recall, I called or emailed back (can't find record of this), clarifying that these were not the records I had requested. Around December 17th the psychologist called my father and asked him if he thought it was ok for me to see the records. My dad told the psychologist that he believed that me being an adult (I'm 25) I should be able to see whatever records I want. I felt that this was inappropriate and emailed back asking to revoke the authorization for them to speak with my father and again requesting the correct records. I've sent a couple of emails since then, each time saying they're going to get them to me, or that they're working on it, but the never do. The staff at the office and my former psychologist are all really nice people. I don't want to take legal action but at this point I'm not sure what else to do. I forgot to mention, I moved 2 hours away. I’m not totally opposed to driving 4 hours, but do you have any other ideas? That’s a good idea. I’ll do that. Ahh I see. Could you maybe call to set up an appointment to stop by to get them? It’s a private practice at the psychologists house. I’m not sure how appropriate it’d be to show up unannounced.

Can you go to the office to speak with someone in person?
