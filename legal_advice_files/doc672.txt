 ,84ypDat I bought a house and moved last summer. I just saw my old roommate who said someone left this business card on his door for me. Not sure if this is legit or a scam... the only thing I can think this could be from is an auto accident I was in from a year and a half ago. But last I checked, my insurance company was no longer listing it as a claim... Process server here. Although I personally don't do it, a lot of other process servers definitely leave notes or business cards at a failed attempt to serve. It's probably legit even though it's a gmail address. They will keep making attempts if you try to dodge service (sorry, thats just our job). If I were you I wouldn't do anything about it. Just wait for a knock I guess. That company has a website. You can contact them and ask if that individual is an employee of theirs. If it's legit there isn't really any upside in trying to dodge service. It's a gmail address. I call total BS. I'd chuck the card and never think of it again.
