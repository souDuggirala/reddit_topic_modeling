 My home is currently 10 years old. I purchased it 2 years ago and the inspection shown that it was in excellent shape with no structural damage. About 3 months ago, construction for a new 'mini mall' started in a plot of land that is around 35 feet from my back yard. Ever since I keep being awoke to my house rattling from something from the construction site. (Heavy machinery, tree removal, etc). Today I noticed a crack above my garage door frame that goes all the way up to the ceiling. I asked my friend who is into house repair what he though it could be and he told me the issue was from Foundation Damage. He also suggested that since this happened so suddenly that its probably from all of the construction going on. My question is this, What should I do? What are my legal options? How can I stop this from destroying my home? Thank you all
