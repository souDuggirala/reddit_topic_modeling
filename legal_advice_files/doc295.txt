 I'm not worried about the spot, I'm all set up, have police permission, and do it all the time. My problem is that the spot I'm at is at an intersection and it's very loud, and I'm having trouble getting my voice loud enough. My plan was to take my laptop and computer speakers, and use my USB condenser mic to pick up my singing and playing. I just don't know if I need some kind of a permit for this? and if so, I would have no idea where to go with that. I live in Cincinnati Ohio thanks guys You need a permit from City Hall. However there is a general “quiet enjoyment” clause that can be enforced. You cannot play after certain hours, blocking egress of buildings, or private property. Police do not give you a right to busk, city hall does.
