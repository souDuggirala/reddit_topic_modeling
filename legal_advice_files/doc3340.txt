 Happened just yesterday and it was only for $750. I immediately regretted my decision and have yet to receive the money (its not like I went out and spent it) Also I'm from MN if that helps.  If you haven’t cashed the check or otherwise gotten the money then you haven’t double dipped. I’m guessing what you’re saying is you’ve committed unemployment fraud in that you filed saying you weren’t working when you actually were? This is a bit more tricky than simply collecting unemployment for too long. They are much more likely to come after you for that. I recommend getting a consultation with an employment attorney, these are usually free or low cost consultations, and they will be able to tell you the best ways to unwind all this yourself if you can’t afford their rates.  Best bet is to call and report your 'mistake' before the state considers it 'fraud'. http://www.uimn.org/applicants/needtoknow/fraud/index.jsp
