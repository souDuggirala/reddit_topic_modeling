 Hi I’ve got a company car, however some low life scum decided to put a paving slab through the window to see what stuff I had inside. At the same time damaging the door and interior leather, so it had to go for repairs. In that time I had a hire vehicle from a company for 10 days. In that ten days I fuelled up 4 times and put nearly 2000 miles on it from brand new. On the tenth day it completely cut out on me whilst I was doing 50mph on a national speed limit road. I had no issues up until this point and I absolutely loved the car, I did not abuse it in any way either over the course I had it. However the car had to eventually be towed away because it wasn’t repairable. I was issued another hire car which I was in for a month whilst waiting for my company car to be repaired. Two months later the rental company are accusing me of abusing the rental car and using incorrect fuel. It was a brand new car with only 4 miles on the clock when it got delivered to me and was a petrol engine. I have got a receipt for the 4 times I refuelled the car and have proof I only used unleaded fuel to fill up. And they are trying to charge me for the damage caused by incorrect fuel type. Other than showing evidence of the receipts what else can I do? Thanks Sam
