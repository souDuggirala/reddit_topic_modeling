 So I recently bought an orangepi loaded with different console emulators and games already loaded onto it. There's about 40,000ish ROMs and about 15 different console emulators. Basically my question is, have the managed to get the rights to legally distribute all those games, or will have they obtained then online? If they have obtained them online, is it legal for them to distribute them? Copyright infringement is like speeding: lots of people do it, only a lucky few get caught, simply because it's logistically impossible to catch them all. Also, there are no "copyright police" that go around looking for infringement -- it's up to the copyright holder to take action against infringement. I've seen it's a pretty common thing, is there just too much of it going in for anyone to be taken to court?  RetroPie [themselves]() do not have a license to any game ROMs or system BIOS images, and as such explicitly refuse to distribute ROMs. [OrangePi](http://www.orangepi.org/) do not appear to make ready-to-use gaming systems. I strongly suspect that the seller prepared that, and you'd have to ask them whether they negotiated licenses or not. However, I'd be stunned if they did - console vendors are waking up to the revenue opportunity represented by retrogaming, and have been systematically preferring first-party platforms over licensing lately. It's more likely that the seller is infringing on 40,000 copyrights and hoping nobody notices. Assuming those ROMs are copyrighted games, you don't have the right to distribute them, and the entity that sold you the pre-loaded OrangePi likely did not either.
