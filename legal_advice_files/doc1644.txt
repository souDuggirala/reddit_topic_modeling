 I have had a lot going on lately and have finally decided to share it publicly in hopes that someone might have some advice or experiences they could share. It is a very long Lifetime kind of movie story so I will just summarize. Unfortunately my father was sick and went to the hospital back in October and then was admitted to a nursing home on November 9th by his wife. She has not seen him, he had zero personal items with him and I knew nothing about any of this. My name was left off of everything so the home had no idea I existed. Drove down to see him and deal with it. We are in the process of having him transferred closer to me and get him in the best position legally. He has dementia and as you can guess is extremely upset. If you have any experience with any of this or have a friend who might have some good advice please let me know. Also prayers would be great!
