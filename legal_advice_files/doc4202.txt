 My current employeer is only looking to hire from outside and will not promote anyone from inside, even if said employee has meet all the required qualifications for the job posting. They won't even interview anyone and decline all internal applications. I was trying to read through: =C34A-5-S107_2018050820180508 but I will admit, most of this is over my head for understanding. Do the employees of this company have any ground to stand on to file a complaint? Appreciate any advice.  Perfect, that is all I wanted to know. Thanks :) While this may be discrimination, it is not illegal discrimination. The statute you quoted is recourse for illegal discrimination. if you read (15), you will see the type of discrimination that is illegal in Utah. Therefore, it is illegal to discriminate based on candidates being internal to the company. You are free to quit and see if you can apply once you quit.  This is perfectly legal.
