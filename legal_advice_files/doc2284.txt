 My father bought a house ten years ago before he gained his citizenship and changed his name. He now wants to place the deed under his new name. How would he go about doing so? Most local title companies will be able to prepare and record a deed for him. They usually charge much less than an attorney. Like the other commenter said - he'd just sign a deed from old name as grantor into his new name as grantee. He'd just need to show proof of name change for the notary.  He can give himself a deed. It won't have any legal effect, mind you, but that's the only way to do it.
