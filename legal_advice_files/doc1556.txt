 I'm from Canada (winnipeg to be exact) and Canadians are pretty nice, but there's this phrase that goes "it be ya own". This guy keeps harassing me and messing with me at the gym and I asked him if he was making fun of me. He told me some bullshit and made fun of me again and then left. I let it go I'm a pretty chill dude and I don't care, but I got home and it kinda bothered me. If he does it again and he doesn't stop can I fuck him up? What are the repercussions? Will the police take my side or the management of the gym? I just wanna beat him up, but he's like rich or something and if he's "connected" I am fucked. BUUUUUT... that's not the issue. I just wanna know if I'm going to face any backlash. Trust me if I wanted to take this to court I would win LIKE easily... (although i just started my new job and i am broke and i dont wanna go through that bullshit) r/iamverybadass Hahaha well i got some verbal ticks and hes making fun of me im larger and stronger than him even tho hes been working out far longer than me. I would actually fuck him up but idk if he has backup or something. So yeah but im pretty chill tho but hes getting to my nerves and ive told nobody about it coz its not my style.  The repercussions of assaulting someone is... being arrested and charged with assault. What did you expect the answer to be? Seriously, I genuinely want to understand.  What would you take him to court for exactly? It's not illegal to be an asshole. It is illegal to assault people though.  Ok gotcha Assault is a crime with both criminal and civil liability possibly, with a slew of other damages they can levy against you, so no...don’t assault someone. The law doesn’t concern your feelings of being hurt by some idiots remarks.  Yes but it’s not politically correct.... any other advice you can give me? hahaha Just leave it alone and no you can’t attack your harasser.
