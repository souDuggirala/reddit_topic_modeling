 Good morning everybody, my mother fell for a scam yesterday where she provided the scammers with her SIN. My family doesn't know what to do. We cancelled the credit cards. My dad is going to the bank now to speak with them to see what he could do. We live in Canada if that helps.

[removed] [removed] Yeah, there's no real point in getting rid of your established credit lines. You want to have those to prove you're you.  I’m not sure if it’s the same in Canada, but in the US if this happened you contact the Credit Bureaus (Equifax, Transunion, Experian) and can put a lock so no one can open new credit in her name.   What you should be worried about is that the scammers start opening new lines of credit with her SIN, not that they access her existing lines of credit. You need to monitor credit reports very carefully to check for new lines of credit. If you do see lines of credit being opened up in her name, contact the authorities and report identity theft. EDIT: Now that you've clarified that she provided both her SIN and CC information to the scammer, things are making more sense. You didn't need to cancel her line of credit, only shut the card down and have them provide her with a new CC number.
