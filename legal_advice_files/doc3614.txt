 I (17) am the son of my father who was arrested for supposed destroying/obstructing police help from my stepmom due to accused assault. We live in Loudoun County, Northern Virginia. Part of the defendant's side, as I believe my father did not injure this women, and likely faked injuries. He was charged with Assault on family member, and destroying a wired/wireless device to prevent help. During the night of my father stepmoms argument, my father put her phone in the drawer (non locked) due to him getting mad for some other reason (her being on her phone too much) but did not destroy, nor disallow her to call the cops. She had complete access to her phone in the drawer, and full access to the home phone (landline), which was not guarded nor blocked My question is, the police never confiscated her device as evidence and I could remember that it was not destroyed. The device is currently in my stepmoms hands, but it is not available to be seen. If she were to destroy it, how could I get any evidence that she did so, and prove that no device was confiscated. THANK YOU SO MUCH REDDIT!!! This is the crime code for destroying a wired/wireless device preventing help in Virginia. []()
