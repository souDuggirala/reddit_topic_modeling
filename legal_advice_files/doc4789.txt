 Quebec, Canada Almost 2 months ago I had a tiny leak in a pipe that dripped down into my downstairs neighbor's bathroom ceiling for less than 24 hours and ended up dripping through the bathroom fan. No damage seems to have happened to the ceiling. The neighbor complained (1 month after the fact) that her fan doesn't suck as much as it used to, which is surely not due to the leak as the building fans are very old and very dirty. However I don't mind replacing her fan if it can buy me peace and avoid involving management and insurance companies. Is there something we can sign that states that changing her bathroom fan frees me from futures claims related to the dripping incident? Any templates I can copy? Otherwise what should this document state? Thank you! Quebec law is very different than anywhere else, and the advice you get may not be relevant. What you are looking for would normally be called a "release" but I have no idea what the equivalent is under civil law.
