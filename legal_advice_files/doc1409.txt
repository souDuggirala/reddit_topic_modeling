 So I have a friend who works as a contractor sterilizing clean rooms for a pharmaceutical company. They often divide their workforce between buildings on their site, all under on contract, and they also offer extra work under another contract at another site. The other contract site has an hourly wage of $17/hr. The employees home site wages are $13/hr. Lately, if the employee has not reached 40 hours at the main site, they take hours worked from the other site to meet that 40, and only pay the $13/hr. I feel like this is illegal not only for reporting purposes by internal accounting, but also because the higher wage was promised at the one site, yet it is not being paid for all hour worked at that site. Can someone help me out in identifying the legality of this practice, and what law covers these actions? Thanks!
