 5 months ago, my boyfriend said he wanted to get a ring but couldn't afford one, so he asked if I would buy it and let him surprise me when the time was right. I thought it was a great idea, and we picked out a $7000 ring. I was so excited knowing we were finally going to get married (we'd been together for almost 4 years at the time), and so I waited. We had went on some romantic outings where I'd assumed it would be the day, but nothing happened. I asked him early last month to make sure he hadn't forgotten, and he said he was still waiting for the right moment. Christmas passed and New Years, still nothing. 3 days ago, I asked again to make sure he hadn't forgotten, and he acted as if there was never any ring. I got a bit suspicious and looked at his texts while he was asleep and found messages from someone else he was seeing, and he gave the ring to her! I confronted him the next morning and he claimed he was called into work and left, refusing to answer me from that point on. He's blocked my number now. I am beyond angry, I was lied to for months and now I'm out $7000. I tried going to the police but they said this was a domestic matter and they won't do anything. What can I do? I want to get the ring back, but I know that if I get it back, the value will be nowhere near the original price. Can I sue him for the difference? Can I get anything for all the time he led me on while he gave it to his mistress? I want to go scorched earth on his ass at this point, and I have the money to lawyer up but I have no clue where to begin, or if there is even anything I can do. You can sue him for the value of the ring when you had it, which as you seem to know wont be full market price. You cannot get compensation for him being a shitbird for any period of time, just for the ring.  The police said a $7000 theft was a domestic issue?
