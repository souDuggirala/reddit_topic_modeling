 Is it considered transformative work to paint a licensed character in the style of an artist for commercial use? E.g. paint a famous mouse in the style of Van Gogh or in a stained glass style art This is especially true when talking about a "famous mouse"... You might be 100% in the right and that may not stop their lawyers from making you spend 6 figures to defend yourself. I’d think no as long as you don’t advertise it as said character.  Probably not. Only sure way to find out is on the other end of an expensive lawsuit.
