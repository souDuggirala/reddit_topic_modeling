This is my dream job, Ive wanted this job since i was in 6th grade. I called my family, gave my two weeks, etc. Then they said they changed their minds. A company I worked for in CA did this and the guy sued and received a settlement. Unless you signed something where your employment was conditional and you didn’t meet that condition then I would strongly urge you to consult with an attorney.  From ops other thread it seems they changed their mind because he didn’t have a college degree even though they initially said that wasn’t a problem.  Did you sign a contract or did you just accept a job offer?  Did you fail a drug test or background check? [deleted] Promissory Estoppel/Detrimental reliance is a tricky area when it comes to offers of employment. I would take all your documentation and receipts to an attorney to review.
