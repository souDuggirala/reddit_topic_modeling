 Hey all, I was up Fromm San Antonio visiting a friend of mine. We are both big car enthusiasts, and decided to go cruise some roads near his home, near Killeen, TX. I received a citation for “exhibition of speed” for what the officer claims was me “chirping the tires.” There have been many times in my life I’ve deserved a ticket, but honestly I don’t believe this to be accurate. I was in a 30mph zone with my friend in front of me. Both of us were in relatively high horsepower cars, and he did indeed hit the throttle in a corner and lose traction slightly. I was behind him. Within about a minute I had an officer behind me with his lights on. I pulled over and complied with everything. His explanation was that I chirped my tires. He did not hit either of us with radar and the citation has no other explanation written other than “exhibition of speed.” I looked over the statute and I don’t think it matches what I was doing. I’m not opposed to defensive driving or deferred adjudication however I won’t have any information on that eligibility for this citation, or fee until after the holidays. Does anyone have any insight into this?
