 (I live in Texas) I was recently backed into by another person who did not have a license and only had a paper printout proof of insurance. He said as long as he showed me insurance he did not have to stay to have police file a report on the incident which was later corroborated by the officer that it isn’t technically a hit and run if he gave me his info. Since the incident I have been in talks with my insurance and they are telling me that the other party’s insurance has not been able to contact them. My insurance is telling me I may have to seek other methods of collecting money for my car bills which I’m assuming means that they are alluding to me settling this in court. If anyone has any advice on what the procedures are in this situation I’d greatly appreciate it! Hey thanks I appreciate the help it means a lot! If you only have liability insurance (minimum coverage), your own insurance company won't be much help. His insurance company failing to respond is a problem. You'll probably need to sue both he and his insurance company. You should probably start with a call to Texas Department of Insurance. 800-252-3439.  I do not have uninsured motorist coverage and the police did file a report for this incident and acquired the other party’s info. I haven’t had to sue anyone so sorry for my ignorance but is it as simple as filing paperwork at the court office or am I missing some key components here? Thanks for help btw What you do depends on what kind of insurance you carry? If you have collision or uninsured motorist coverage, your insurance should be compensating you if the other is unresponsive. If not, you may very well have to sue. Always ask to have a police report filed.
