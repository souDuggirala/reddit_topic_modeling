 Iâ€™ve recently had the idea of buying and reselling items from my place of employment. The items are usually deeply discounted and I think I can flip them for profit. Are there any things I should be aware of or any issues I might have before I move forward? I live in Ohio.  No. Millions of people resell items online. I do full time. Perfectly legal. Your company may not approve and it's most likely against a policy so they'll probably give you the axe.  What kind of contractual obligations could the buyer have? Maybe, maybe not, typically you can resell products you buy, but you might have contractual obligations based on your purchases from the company. Are there any concerns on the side of reselling a retail product? You could be fired for it if it goes against your company's policy. You could and likely would be fired for running a business that is in competition with your employer.
