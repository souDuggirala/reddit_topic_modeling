 My girlfriend works at a restaurant in town, (privately owned, not a chain) and recently found out that one of her coworkers who is 19 is sleeping with their boss, who is 37. Because of this, she has been getting preferred treatment in the workplace, and my girlfriends boss found out about my girlfriends knowledge of their relationship, and has been drastically changing her schedule and hounding her around work over small unimportant things, making my SOâ€™s job very difficult. Is there anything that can be done from a legal standpoint? This sort of behavior is not okay.  Nothing illegal about this. Boss can give preferential treatment to his girlfriend all day long and could fire yours if she doesn't like it. They may be self-conscious about the overall situation and overall age gap. If your girlfriend wants to salvage this job she should probably back off and avoid any appearance of judgmentalism. If she had said or done anything cross, an apology may be in order. It sucks to have to do, but practically speaking, it's a way out of the conflict that preserves the working relationship. Legally, unless the coworker were a minor, or there was some sort of discrimination against your girlfriend specifically know the basis of something like gender or disability or race, there's nothing amiss. Nothing in your post suggests any laws are being broken. She can find a new job.  Assuming you're in the US: It's not illegal for consenting coworkers to have a sexual relationship. Nor is it illegal for one's boss to be a dick.
