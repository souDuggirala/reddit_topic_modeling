 For the last year my apartment complex has experienced a vehicle burglary/theft almost monthly in the same area of the complex. The area has a gate that has a lock on one side of the handle but anyone over 5'1" can reach over the gate and unlock and a second gate that is missing a latch completely. There is very little lighting in the area and no apartments face the lot. They have been informed of each break in and the only step that have taken is to ad the locked handle mentioned above about 6 months ago. They have been informed that the lock in ineffective and changes need to be made. They have not taken anyother action to rectify the situation. What( if any) legal action can taken against the complex in order to get proper securities set up to deter crime? This is in California. I also have state statute but am unsure if its usable. Landlords have a duty to take reasonable steps to protect tenants from the foreseeable criminal acts of another. CAL. CIV. CODE ยง 1714. Criminal acts can include conduct such as assault, battery, robbery, murder, rape, drug abuse, and property damage. When a landlord fails to use reasonable care to protect their tenants, they can be held liable for the negligent or intentional criminal conduct of a third party. CACI NO. 1005. Not much. Some states or cities will require them to take action or expose them much like health departments do restaurants with a rating etc, but in the end very little can be done. They do have an obligation to inform tenants of crime that has happened on their property in most states, especially if it is violent. "reasonable steps" has a lot of wiggle room in it. This is the bane of apartment living, I am afraid. Sadly, most apartment community management is based more on herding cattle then protecting them. Be care of you poke them in the eye by being too vocal etc as they can be vindictive. They are corporations and behave as such.
