 A gym promised certain amenities when they originally convinced me to join. However, for a while they said that they were working on it and admitted that they under delivered. Today I asked and they said that they will not be delivering on that amenity. I saw somewhere that I could get money back to the value of that amenity. I am in California. Thanks!
