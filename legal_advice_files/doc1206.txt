 I got arrested for public intoxication and got ordered 35 hours of community service with no fee. My court date was January 4th and when I left I looked and saw my new court date was May 23rd so I kind of brushed it off. 35hours between then and may 23rd seemed easy. Apparently I was supposed to email one of the community services site within 9 days of the date listed on my court papers (which is January 4th) so, on the 18th, I emailed the lady in charge of one of the sites and she told me to come in on the next orientation date (tomorrow) So, my question is, am I in trouble ? I'm kind of scared shes gonna see i was supposed to come by before the 13th and report me and I'll go to jail for contempt of court. Not sure about your specific state but for the most part just get your hours done before your court date and you'll be fine.
