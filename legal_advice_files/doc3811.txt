 There was a local event at a park and the event host had laid those plastic interlocking tiles to form a pathway through the event space. The event was at night so the pathway is not properly lit up enough to see that one of the tiles has disconnected from the other tiles and was raised up enough that an individual tripped and fell from it. The individual suffered a dislocated shoulder, torn tendons and rotator cuff resulting in being in a brace , unable to reach for items and physical therapy. They are now also unable to work (possibly getting fired). What are my options? Iâ€™ve never dealt with anything about trying to take legal action. Contact the company who organized the event. They likely have insurance you can file a claim with.  The individual. Didn't want to make it too obvious.  Are you the individual or one of the event organizers? The organizers of the event should have had some liability insurance. Find out who to talk to to get this info.
