I don't know if this right for this sub but, I have a question. I will try an explain the situation as best I can but, it would be better if you could watch the episode. So a little girl is kidnapped, witnesses see a dark green SVU leaving the scene. Another witness says that the suspect approached her and asked for help finding his dog named Candy. Profilers profile that the dog has died. Then they get a tip about a guy the neighbor says that the guy has a dark green SUV and that he had a dog named Candy that passed about 6 months ago. The detective said they couldn't go into the suspects house because they don't have probable cause. I just don't understand how they wouldnt have probable cause. Wouldn't there be enough cause if they believed there was someone being held against their will. Did they just add this aspect for drama.  Wtf lol
