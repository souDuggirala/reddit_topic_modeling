 I’m using fake names. James and Clarissa were married for 10 years and had two sons named Brad and Kent. Clarissa died in 1984. Clarissa never made a Will. He and the children continued to live in the family home. In 1995, James re-married with a woman named Elizabeth. Elizabeth immediately moved into the James’ home with her 7-year-old son. Within one year, they had a daughter together. James died on January 2, 2015. Elizabeth and the daughter continued to live in the family home. A few years after Clarissa’s death, before he was married to Elizabeth, James made a Will giving his entire estate to his older son, Brad, and naming Brad as his executor. Brad wants to sell his deceased father’s home. Can Brad sell the house even though his father’s wife and child still live there? I don't practice in Texas, but my quick read suggests that the homestead rights apply only to the homestead, not the entire estate. Talk to a local lawyer. So, even if they husband specifically said in his Will that his son would retain his entire estate, the wife will retain the entire estate under the homestead act? I don’t think so. It appears that the wife has homestead rights.
