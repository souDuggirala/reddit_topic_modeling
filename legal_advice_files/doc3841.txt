 About three weeks ago I deposited my check through a mobile app my bank offers. It did not go through immediately and I needed the money. I called the bank and I was told I could cash out the check and receive a fee for cancelling the deposit. I cash out the check and notice a couple of days later that the check also deposited. I called the bank immediately to let them know. It still has not come out of my account. Yesterday I called again and they said it's a waiting game at this point. Should I let my employer know at this point? I didn't think it would take this long and I don't want to look like I'm committing fraud. If you want to be extra safe, notify the bank in writing about their error and save the documentation. This is a bank issue only. This wouldn’t effect your employer at all since you already handled the reverse, they’re not out the money, the bank is. It goes without saying but don’t let yourself spend that extra money that’s in your account. They will sort it out eventually whether you told them or not. Yes, let your supervisor and/or HR department know. Your employer may notice the mistake if you don't and start the process themselves. If so, you could be debited by then AND when your bank makes the correction.
