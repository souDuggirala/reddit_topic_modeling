 I’m worried, it’s about to get cold again and I don’t trust this building to hold any heat. What do I do? I’m worried it’ll be unsafe and frankly extremely uncomfortable to sleep here tonight Is my landlord obligated to put me up somewhere or reimburse me if I go somewhere? It’s me and my dog I’m really worried that it won’t start working again and the landlord said they’ll come tomorrow morning not today
