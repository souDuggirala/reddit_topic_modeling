 Hello all. I've been employed part-time at my company for about 2 years now. I was employed all of 2018 and had about 1591 hours which averages to 30.5 hours a week even though I'm scheduled to only work 25 hours since they are always asking me to stay late. The company sent me an email on November 2018 stating that I could now sign up in open enrollment which I did. I got a card on January but later the health insurance told me it was invalid because I was switched from part-time eligible to part-time non-eligible in an audit. I emailed my HR today about it and in a CC'ed email, my supervisor told her that it was my responsibility to manage my hours. Is there anything I can do about this? Assuming your employer is a large employer subject to ACA, it does not create a right for you to have health insurance from your employer. If they fail to offer insurance when required by the law, they simply pay a penalty under ACA. Having said that, the Plan Document (if it's covered by ERISA, which most employer-provided health plans are) for the benefit plan is the authoritative document for who is/isn't eligible for insurance. You need to read that and see if you are eligible. If you are eligible and it's not being provided, it may be an ERISA violation. it is ur responsibility to manage your hours. if they ask u to stay late, but they don't require you too, then don't stay late. if u were to get 25/hours/week then you wouldn't be eligible in the first place  It is legal for your employer to require that your hours stay below 30 or some other threshold in a work week. And to expect you to decline "staying late" or other overages when you would violate that.
