 At my sisters birthday party at her boyfriends house. He jokingly pushed me out of the door and I slipped, fell down 3 stairs, and broke my patella and tore my patella tendon. It was an accident, not malicious. I have health insurance so the surgery and all of the medical expenses are taken care of. However I will be out of work, I’m an independent contractor and substitute teacher, for 3 months as I can’t walk. I’m curious as to ways I can get my living expenses covered? Can I sue his homeowners insurance? How would I go about doing this? You can file a claim with his HOI to cover the costs of your injuries and also claim lost income as well. They should cover your injuries, but I'm not certain about lost income.
