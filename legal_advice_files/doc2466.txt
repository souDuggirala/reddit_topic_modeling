 I've been reading up on nominative fair use, and I think I am passing the three part test set out by US case law, but wanted more opinions than my own. I produce aftermarket accessories for various optics. On my website, the items are labelled as "widget upgrade for [trademark] [model name/number]". and the copy of each description clearly states: "[trademark], and [model name] are trademarks of [trademark holder] and are used for descriptive purposes only. Any [trademark holder] products pictured are for descriptive purposes only and are not for sale. This product has is not affiliated with [trademark holder]. These products are not manufactured or endorsed by [trademark holder]." In addition, I'm not using any graphic logos that belong to the trademark holder, only written trademarks. Am I in the clear on this,or at least using best practices? I'm in the US, in Florida to be particular. no, as it fails the non-obvious test. Levers and wheels for focusing turrets are common aftermarket upgrades. I will add the trademark holder does not make these items for their own products.  does someone else hold a patent on the "widget upgrade"?
