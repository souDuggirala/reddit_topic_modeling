 The story is length, but in a nutshell, my friend served his sentence for the crimes he had committed, bank robbery, and while incarcerated for a parole violation (quite serious, sentencing of a year) he was threatened harm and forced to wound another inmate. He had his hearing in the state of California with Judge Percy Anderson. Judge Anderson is the 6th worst judge in CA, and he upheld that rating in this case. So much was done wrong, from the judge denying the victims statement in support of my friend, to also disallowing the testimony of the Psychiatrist assigned to my friend. I have copious amounts of paperwork and he does have a lawyer but he is hesitant to have his parents pay anymore towards his legal case. He had been incarcerated for quite some time and had gotten out and was well on his way to reintegrating into society when this judge decided he would render the most severe sentence possible. We are trying to do as much as we can to help him, from raising money to legal advice from anyone willing. Rule 8. Stay or Injunction Pending Appeal (a) Motion for Stay. (1) Initial Motion in the District Court. A party must ordinarily move first in the district court for the following relief: (A) a stay of the judgment or order of a district court pending appeal; (B) approval of a bond or other security provided to obtain a stay of judgement; or (C) an order suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting an injunction while an appeal is pending. Does anyone know where we would start with this? Is this something that would really only be achievable with a lawyer? Any advice? Because it says right in the rules "no identifying information." This is a sensitive board and people could be harmed or harrassed when identified.  Why? Do not bring identifying information on judges in here, what the fuck is wrong with you??
