 Hey guys, wondering if anyone's ever received a court summons from GWR. I got £20 fine about 2 months ago, I moved house in between them contacting me and told them about it. They kept sending letters to my old house upping the fine and 2 days ago a final chance to pay the now £150 fine or go to court. I've just found out from a new tenant in my old house who contacted me via facebook. I'm not really sure what to do, I literally can't pay the fine, I don't have the money. I also don't feel I should as I told them about my new address. Sidenote: I've contacted their prosecution team through email and attempted by phone but their lines are closed until tomorrow. I was just wondering if anyone else has had a court summons from them? Ta guys Try /r/legaladviceuk
