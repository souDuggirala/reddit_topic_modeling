 I am leaving my current company in Florida and I have 4 weeks of accrued vacation. My employee handbook states: Unless expressly proscribed by statute or contract, employment with CompanyA ® is on an "at will" basis and may be terminated with or without cause or notice. Similarly, employees are free to resign their employment at any time. If at any time it is necessary for an employee to resign his or her employment with the Company, CompanyA ® requests at least two weeks’ notice. Failure to provide notice may lead to forfeiture of accrued vacation or other benefits at the discretion of CompanyA ®. Any employee who is discharged by CompanyA ® shall be paid only wages accrued to the effective date of the separation. I am just trying to understand. Does this mean that I will be paid for my accrued vacation? I am not relying on it, I just don’t know what leaving really means for me. No but you should get paid for those 2 weeks and all accrued vacation I agree... But worth considering that you may get walked out on they day you give notice, they don't have to let you work those two weeks and in my industry (IT) it is standard to not let people work those two weeks. As long as you did give two weeks notice then yes, it sounds like you will be paid that time.
