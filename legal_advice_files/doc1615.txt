 My question is, does the franchise have to be reimburse me for the amount of the phone? It was an iPhone Xr. Probably not, but you possibly could file a claim with your homeowners or renters insurance. You don't give enough info to give any good answers. Probably not though, your recourse is with the person that robbed you. I assume you already went to the police and locked your phone remotely. Without your employment contract, we have no way of knowing  The franchise only requires you have a device capable of a few basic functions. That could be a $49 special at walmart. You choosing to use a phone that's 15x more expensive was your decision. But it also depends on state, county, company, paperwork you signed, etc.
