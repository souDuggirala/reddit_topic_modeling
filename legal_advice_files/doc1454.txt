 EEOC ruled in favor of charging party in a recent determination; company won’t settle; can the charging party release that information publicly… Understanding that their (the employee/charging party) privacy would be exposed…all pre-litigation.  I think almost everything was exposed during the EEOC investigation… But I see what you’re saying If/when you do get to the point of filing a lawsuit then the court case filings, deposition transcripts, interrogatories, etc. will all become public information. Until then keep your cards close to the vest. Fair enough thank you  [removed] It's a stupid thing to do without your attorney's guidance. I'm not going to help you torpedo your own case. I just wanna know if it’s illegal to disclose… If I remember correctly the EEOC investigator said it wasn’t but I want to make sure there’s no backlash You should never "go public" without the specific advice of your attorney. No it was an actual determination letter saying they found likely cause that the employer violated three federal laws… And then asking us to conciliate… Employer is being an asshole about settling at an appropriate amount… Trying to determine if I want to go public for Leverage-Next step would be right to sue/lawsuit… Was the ruling in favor simply a right to sue letter?
