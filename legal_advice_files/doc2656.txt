 A city contractor is doing road work on our block. Yesterday my wife pulled out of the drive way and her muffler got caught on the steel plate, bending the muffler. They usually put asphalt to smooth out any difference in plane height but not this time. Our insurance company isn't covering it, comprehensive coverage doesn't cover hitting a stationary object. The contractor is suggesting we not file a claim with their insurance and is assuring us they will pay cash if we fix the car. Do we get it in writing? File a claim anyway? If we fix the car could they back peddle and never pay us? If you have their insurance info, keep that handy if they balk at paying when they hear the amount it'll cost. Yeah, they're gonna get sticker shock. Get insurance information from them just in case. Get their promise to pay the repair bills in writing. I don't have a quote yet, taking it into the shop tomorrow. I'll get the quote and then ask the contractor to get it in writing.  I imagine it's going to 3-4k, the bent muffler busted the catalytic converter. this whole situation is terrible  Abso-flippin'-loutely. Abso-flippin'-loutely; in fact, I would almost expect them to do exactly this once they get sticker shock on how much it actually costs to fix a car, like many people do. Do you have a quote for how much it would cost to repair? And is the contractor willing to sign stating they will reimburse you for the repair costs?
