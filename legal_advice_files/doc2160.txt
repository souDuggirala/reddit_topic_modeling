 When we were filling up the migration forms, we decided to be honest and included all of her previous jobs including those where she used a made up SSN. I am worried that that could result in a denial of our case. My question is, could that be an issue? And if so, what would be the best way to address it? Thank you.  If it's a valid SSN, then she was using someone else's. That person is going to have problems with the IRS because of her.  Most people are able to get past this but she needs a lawyer.  thanks for the precedent   doesn't Identity theft requires that the person knew that the information belongs to another person? My wife straight up made up a random number. She entered legally but she overstay her visa. We do have an attorney, however, he seems to be a busy for the moment. I figured I may a little research for the moment while I wait for his replay. Thank you for your reply. You need an immigration attorney. I wouldn't take a chance on anything in this climate. It technically would make her ineligible to adjust status under [INA 245(c)]() (and thus unable to adjust status), however there is an exception for “immediate relatives” of a US citizen, including a spouse. Still, you should consult with an immigration attorney - if she initially entered without inspection (“snuck over the border”) your options are more limited than if she entered legally and overstayed a visa.  Identity theft is a felony, so it certainly will be an issue.  [You should really contact an immigration lawyer]().
