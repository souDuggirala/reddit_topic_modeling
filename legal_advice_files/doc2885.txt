 Someone I had tried to help via treatment previously is now being convicted of murder due to a robbery gone wrong. He personally was not the triggerman. however everybody else is rolling over and saying he was. his mother said that she had a conversation with a girl involved and she told her everything. However nothing was recorded. I do not personally know the truth however what I am seeking is the best way to find him respectable legal representation. His family does not have money. his mother called me frantic and desperate and does not know what to do and is looking to me for help as if I have some answer. This is in Indiana. if anyone is aware of any defense attorneys that do pro bono or anything of the sort it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you If he is poor enough, the state should assign him a public defender.
