 I worked at ups since end of September and during the time I landed my dream job. They really needed me through the end of the holiday season so I agreed to work both jobs until last Friday the 21st. So I woke up this morning to find I hadn't received my paycheck. What are my options to pressure him to pay up if he won't respond to me?  Follow up with HR, it may either have been mailed to you or available for pick up. Some companies will turn off direct deposit after an employee terms.  Go by their office to pick up your final paycheck. If they don't have one or will not let you, contact your state's Department of Labor and open a complaint for unpaid wages. They should have had your final check for you as of your last day, but it looks like Kansas does allow for normal pay cycle payouts.
