 My brother recently got hired at a well known restaurant that i also work at, and today was his second day of training. He clocked in at 3:30pm, and later in the night our manager told him that she would be changing his clock in time to 5:00pm because they “aren’t busy”. he’s upset about it and i am too. is this legal? what can i do about it? i have no way of knowing if she’s done this to my hours without my knowledge because we can’t see the number of hours we’ve worked unless we ask a manager. our mom says this is illegal and wants to do something about it, and i do too but i don’t know if i have a leg to stand on. he’s making minimum wage until he’s done with training, in two days. hopefully he actually gets his minimum wage in the next couple days. Ahh. Maybe the minimum wage is a temporary thing. He can probably ask how long it will be. But yeah, make sure he gets paid during the slow period.  He doesn’t directly make any tips, only the servers do. He’s a busser so he gets a percentage of their tips. As do i, as a hostess. Either way, he didn’t get tip share or his minimum wage. It’s illegal to change the hours. But what happens if he gets tips right now? Does he have to turn them over? As a tipped employee, the employer has to pay any difference in case they don’t equal out to minimum wage. So if minimum wage is $10/hr, they worked 30 hours, their tipped income plus tips should be at least $300. I’m thinking the employer put them on minimum wage to make it easier to figure all this out. Thinking they may not get enough tips as he’s new.
