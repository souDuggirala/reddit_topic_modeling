 Step-Father is unfortunately going through a lot of medical things. He is going to have major surgery on his spine before the end of the year. He will be out of work 2 months minimum. I read that his company cannot take away his medical insurance due to the Federal Medical Leave Act. However, he only gets 3 weeks vacation and he is worried he won't get paid any after 3 weeks, so he is trying to withdraw his 401k. His company has been giving him the run around for a month now and is basically trying to prolong and avoid giving him his 401k. Can they legally do this? He had to go around his employer to get to the company that administers his plan just to get the form, but has to have the Trustee sign it in order for it to be approved. He is applying for a Hardship withdrawal. He has been paying into this for almost 30 years now.  No, he doesn't pay into it. Very silly, I know. We are working on getting him his SSDI right now given his doctors tell him he should not work anymore due to his spinal problem; he is a mechanic for diesel trucks. We just got a Probono attorney and are waiting to hear back on some things.  Does he have short term disability coverage on his insurance? If so use that instead of the 401k.
