 I work for small a very small business. In the past and present I’ve been using my personal vehicle to pick up and drop off client samples. They do reimburse me for the mileage/tolls with no hassles. However, this is my vehicle and have become quite tired of using it for work. In the last few months we’ve discussed obtaining a “new” vehicle for the company such that I don’t have to use mine. Sounds like they’re just about ready to obtain one, however I was asked if I could put that vehicle under my insurance and they reimburse me each month. Their logic was “because company insurance is not cheap.” I told them I couldn’t do that for a few reasons, and would like to know if it was it even legal for them to ask me that question? State is CA Likely the vehicle will only be driven by me but nothing is written in stone. I won’t, trust me. Really??? I want to dive deeper into this, glad I said no! Do not do that. That would be insurance fraud. If you wvwr did get into a accident, the insurance company could refuse coverage .
