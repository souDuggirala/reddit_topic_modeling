 I am wanting to somehow get access to records via a freedom of information act request pertaining to assault reports if this is possibly. Is there any information I can get publicly? Also, what are my rights? What should I do to not get in trouble? I live in Texas if that helps.  Texas PIA suggestions: If you are the victim of a crime, file a criminal complaint with the police department. Sexual assault is a crime. The school is not a police department.
