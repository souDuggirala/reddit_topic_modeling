 This family is all kinds of fucked up. My dads brother seems to be upset after getting a super small percentage from my grandfathers will. (He was NEVER around to help my grandfather). Needless to say, he sent a request to get a copy of the will via mail and used a signature confirmation etc. Should he have a lawyer send it over or just mail it registered to his brother?
