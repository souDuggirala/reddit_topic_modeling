 I have been a fool, one day i was stolen my whatsapp account, I gave an account restoration code by mistake. I have now recovered it but I'm afraid if they can keep track of my messages, can they? on the other hand, there's messages to numbers in Spain (I'm from Colombia) wich i dont know, i cant read them yet, because they are still loading, (don't know if they will ever end loading), my question is, can they access other accounts via whatsapp? if those messages have illegal content or something should i erase them/block the numbers? should i change my phone number? what actions should i take to avoid any repercussions of this(besides changing passwords and reporting to police)
