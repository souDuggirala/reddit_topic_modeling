 Sold a pair of off whites that i bought on ebay, the seller said he got it legit checked and they passed so i bought it. Listed it on GOAT and shipped it to their “legit check” department. They emailed me back that they’re fake so i paid the shipping cost to ship it back to me so i can ship it back to the person on eBay. They sent me tracking number on December 17th and it was supposed to be delivered on the 18th. It is now January 4th and i still don’t have my shoes and they aren’t responding to my emails. How can i threaten them so that they send me my shoes back?  Firstly, if they sent you a tracking number, have you checked that tracking number? The question right now is whether the shipping company has the shoes, or GOAT. What actions you take next (or what you ask GOAT to do) will depend on that.
