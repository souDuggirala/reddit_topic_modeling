 Hey everyone. So I bought a utility trailer in NH and left the title inside the trailer. When I went to grab it the next day so I can go to the DMV the title was fully covered in power steering oil which leaked from one of the cabinets above. Problem is that all the pen handwriting on it with the seller, buyer, lienholder signatures disappeared and it looks like shit but you can still read everything on it. I also have a bill of sale from the seller. What can I do now? Does the seller has to order a new one that the lienholder has to sign again and I have to drive 10 hours+ to the seller again or is there a better way to take care of this? Yes, it's a 7000 GW trailer. I believe NYS doesn't require titles for trailers under 999 pounds. Does your state require a title for a trailer? Some only require a bill of sale.
