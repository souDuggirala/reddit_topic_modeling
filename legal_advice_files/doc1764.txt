 Skipping past the relationship/hearing detail, I had an eight month order of protection issued against me a few months back. It is considered civil, and I know it only becomes criminal if I violate it, but I'm wondering if pre-employment background searches typically would pull this information out if it remains civil throughout. This is for a position within the finance industry in Illinois if that makes a difference. I have seen a little bit of everything with a general consensus of "it depends how far they want to search." I'm just trying to determine if it's something I should mention to an upcoming job I am interviewing for before they would potentially pull it up. Thanks Last state I lived in, it was common for employers to order background checks directly from the state. The state also allowed individuals to order their own background checks. You could order your own and see what it says. You could try figuring out which company they use to conduct the background check, order one through them for yourself. Although, I don't think I would want you to have any access to my financial information if you have impulse control and judgement / common sense issues stemming so deeply that your ex won an order of protection against you.
