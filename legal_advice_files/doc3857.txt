 I am not an employee so I own those designs right?  Hundred percent it was for I didn’t represent them anywhere. I wasn’t paid for it so I was never an employee. Just something I designed for them and they do want me long term but I’m not signing anything or associating with them at all now I’m done with them would rather kill myself than work with them What if OP fails to prove that he made those designs. I'm fairly sure that's the case but it's possible I'm wrong. There is a difference between "on behalf of" and "for" I think. It sound like you did the latter.  In case you can prove that they are your belongings, you can charge a file for them. I don't know much about law but I feel like that it would be by your side Exactly my point that’s what I’m asking  If they did it for the organization, without any pay or contacts, wouldn't OP still own the copyright?  There’s text message conversations that prove I do  I do own the designs I have the technical files. They just have the image.  As far I know, if there are no records or proof that you own those designs. I guess there's nothing you can do. There was no contract.  It depends on your contract with them. Does your contract state you retain the rights? Or did you willingly give it to them to use as they decided?
