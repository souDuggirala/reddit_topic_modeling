 Ok, so I have a roommate who asked me to ask you guys how she should handle this situation so here it is: She quit her job and received all the checks that she had earned, but then they kept sending her regular checks to her. The first extra check they sent to her, she cashed it and used it to help pay bills and then the second check rolls around and she realized it must be a payroll error so she calls her old employer to tell them to take her off payroll and they tell her she has take bring that check back as well as pay back that full extra check that they sent her. So, lawyers of reddit, what should she do?  -employer could sue her, and easily win. It would not be a stretch for a company to be convincing enough with the police to get fraud or similar criminal charges filed and have her arrested as well... It might not stick in court, but that wont stop it from being a hell of a bad time. Thanks for the feedback She should pay the company back any wages she did not work for and earn.
