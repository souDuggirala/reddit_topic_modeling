 When I was sent a marketing email I clicked on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the email, it took me to a page where I could "unsubscribe from cable promotions," "unsubscribe from all (INTERNET PROVIDER) emails," or "customize what I receive." Except none of the links work. They're not even links, they're just highlighted and underlined text. So I logged into my (INTERNET PROVIDER) account and found the "Manage Emails" link, thinking that might work. It brought me to the same page with the non-links. Could this be grounds for a class-action lawsuit? Not sure if I flaired this appropriately. Oh yeah, I know I can just send them to spam, which is what I normally do, but since this is a service I actually use, I don't want to have to check my spam for emails periodically since they may send something if someone tried to use my account or when my bill is ready or something like that. Because my email would just mark all emails from (IP) as spam. Could be a technical error, but I highly doubt it's an accident. Someone else suggested reporting them at but that's currently a joke since the government is shut down. I was just curious more than anything. Thanks. Might be illegal, might be an IT issue. Some options... 1) Find a lawyer who’ll take it on. I’ve no clue how to do this. 2) On their website, find a “Help” page and report the error. 3) In your email client, set up a filter to send their emails straight to the trash unread (or to an archive or spam folder if you don’t want this nuclear option).  Maybe. Who's going to bankroll a class action lawsuit though? Are you?
