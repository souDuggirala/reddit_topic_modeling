Hello, 

I want to start a business. I have an idea and a plan and Im pretty much ready to get started. However, Im also married and I dont have a lot of confidence for the marriage long term. I want to draw up a post nuptial agreement, but I could easily see her not signing anything of the sort. 

What, if anything, can I do to protect myself and my business should she refrain from signing the agreement? 

Thank you very much. Your state is incredibly important here. In some states, a post-nuptial agreement is not enforceable unless both parties have their own attorney. So this is not something that you can or should DIY.  Get divorced now. You should speak to a family law attorney about your options, but it's very likely that your interest in that business will be a marital asset. If you want to prevent that, and if your spouse isn't willing to cooperate, your only option will be to get divorced first.
