 Manitoba, Canada. I own a personal mailbox attached to my house and also an official multi-mailbox unit set up in the middle of our block that serves our block that has since replaced my personal one for all official mail. My province has moved onto using these "community mailboxes" now as they are less labor intensive. My personal one does not receive any real mail, just ads and flyers. I started getting a large hunk of fliers that filled my personal mailbox every day. I would empty it every day, then it transitioned to multiple times a day. I put up a sign that says no fliers please and I still get them. If I don't empty my mailbox, they then get thrown on the ground in front of my house. Papers end up everywhere especially on a windy day. Is this not littering? Is the only way to stop this to make a police report, get security cameras, the entire ordeal? Would I get in trouble for "littering" even though these people throwing garbage on my property? Thanks, I'm such an idiot Is there a reason you haven't just removed the box?
