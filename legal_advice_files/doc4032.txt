 So my girl was pulled over for not fully stoping and a stop sign. after all the papers were handed over he asked when she had smoked last. She told the truth and said about 16 hours ago. The cop asked if it was in the car, she said yes, however she just lost her medical card recently and cannot find it. After she told the cop that, she removed her stuff from the back seat. Nothing but shake in a grinder and a pipe. The cop recieved another call and said she will recieve stuff in the mail and let her go. Simply told Ali to reorder her card and show that during the hearing. Should she get a lawyer. The cop seemed fairly willing to work with her considering the siuation. She is terminally ill and he was awre of that after speaking with her. I just dont want to sugest to her a lawyer and ruin the hearing. I looked on the docket portal today. and she recieved 2 misdemeanors. But certainly she should until she provides a medical card. He was just taking her word for it. Now if she wants to request a public defender instead. and just get a lawyer consultaion. Would that be acceptable.  [removed] Yes she should consult with a criminal defense attorney, because she may very well receive a summons in the mail for a misdemeanor. Having a consultation with a criminal defense attorney that specializes in drug possession would be recommendable. While the police officer may have been friendly, and his/her advice may even be accurate- the usual rule of thumb is to not just take the word of a LEO, and take the most conservative approach (talking to your own lawyer).
