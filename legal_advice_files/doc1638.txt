 Ok so be nice to me because I am incredibly ignorant to legal talk. I had gotten a voicemail today from a woman in the leasing office of where I used to live (lease was done in December and I haven’t lived there since June but still paid in full up until the lease was done) and was told they needed my forwarding address (I forgot to give this to them when I admittedly dropped my keys off) because they were filing a second cause against myself and ex roomie. I googled what this meant (obviously) and the only things I’m finding are mainly talking about eviction but we paid rent all the way up until our lease was up. There were damages (broken outlets, carpet, blinds). Do we have to appear in court for this or will they just bill us? Can we just pay the sum in full that we owe or will our wages be garnished? Will they charge us rent until the apartment is livable again? Thanks in advance guys!
