 About a week ago someone I know stole weed I just bought legally where I live in Colorado. They know more about smoking so I just asked for their recommendation on what I should get. Right after I bought it I brought it over to their place just to show them what I got exactly. Everything together was kinda expensive and as I was leaving they took it all out of my car without me knowing. By the time I could go back to get what they stole they were already driving back home to Utah. If I reported them to their local police what could they do and since they’re only 20 and the legal age to buy it in Colorado is 21 would I get in trouble with the police? I am over 21 and bought the weed legally. I even still have the receipt. Yes, but I felt like I left some of the details out of that post that I should’ve included Are you the same person where it’s actually your ex who stole it when you went to “chill” with them?
