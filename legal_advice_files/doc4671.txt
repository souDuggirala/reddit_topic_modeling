 My girlfriend was in a car accident last week. Here’s what happened: she was driving behind a car on her way home, then (without a turn signal or any form of signaling) went over into the other (oncoming) lane. My girlfriend thought he was either slowing down to let her pass or turning left into a driveway so she didn’t slow down to get past him and get out of his way. He then turns back into the lane to do a wide turn into a driveway, she slams on her breaks but it wasn’t enough and she hit him. She got a ticket for failure to control vehicle and wants to go to court and fight it? Even the cop said she should since he technically “gave up his lane.” Are there any laws here in Texas that talk about giving up lanes and all of that TL:DR - Man goes to other lane, then suddenly turns back to make a wide turn into driveway. Girlfriend hits him, what can she do about it? Location: Texas, USA Precisely,in any case the driver should keep the distance . If the hit was directly from behind his girlfriend can't do nothing Yes, he shares a portion of the blame here, but that doesn't get her off the hook. Unless he swerved into the other lane and slammed on his brakes, she still should have had sufficient distance to stop in time.  No she wasn’t close she just didn’t slow down which caused her to be closer but not purposely. But even if the guy didn’t signal it’s still her fault? Can they not both be at fault. Yes she should’ve been more careful but shouldn’t have he practiced safer driving habits? She can go to court and fight it, but pretty much any time you run into a car that was in front of you, it's your fault. When you don't understand what the driver in front of you is doing, you need to slow down and be careful. It also suggests that she was following him way too close.
