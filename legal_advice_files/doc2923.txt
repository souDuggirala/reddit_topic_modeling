 I’m transferring to a University from a Community College and admissions are asking for my transcripts from High School. I know how this works already since I have done it once before for the community college so I do not understand what is happening. I ordered my transcripts from Parchment a few days ago and today I got an email back saying I owe almost $200 in fees, which cannot be true because I had to pay all my fees before ordering my transcripts to go to the community college. I do not know how to contest this. They’ve been known to do this in the past before, as my sister also had to go through the same thing but in her case she had receipts and in my case I do not. This feels like extortion. My question is: will I be forced to pay the fees or is there any action I can take? How is it not all computerized in the first place? Thanks in advance to whomever is nice enough to help!  Contact the school and find out what the fees are. Right now you have incomplete information.  I feel I should also point out that I transferred High Schools before junior year. This is my second attempt at ordering my transcripts from this high school. My first attempt, my order was placed on hold just like now but instead of telling me I owe them money, they said I needed to order my transcripts from the other school since that’s the last High School I went to.  They do not say, actually. What it does say is “owes fees to ____middle school and ____high school” I did not know that was an option! I’m going to try that. What are they saying you owe fees for? And have you tried getting a copy of the records from the Community College you already attended?
