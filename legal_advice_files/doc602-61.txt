I live in California, US. I work minimum wage job. I believe it is the law that we get 24 hours of paid sick time a year. I asked my manager if I could use those sick hours and she said I need a doctors note. 

Do I need a doctors note? If so, can I just go to any doctor that can write me a note? I’ve called in sick multiple times but I’ve never gotten any pay for it. And would like to! Thanks for your time.  Where I’m from if you’re out 48 hours or call our two shifts in a row you are legally required to bring in a doctors note. But that could differ in states. As far as I know they're not supposed to require a doctor's note for your mandatory time (the 24 hours) and should only do so once your legally mandated paid sick time is used up: https://advocacy.calchamber.com/2016/02/11/paid-sick-leave-law-questions-continue-to-trouble-employers-wanting-to-comply/

They most likely should've paid you the first three times you called out sick. I believe you need a doctors note after being out sick for 3+ days.
