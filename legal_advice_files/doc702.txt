 My work has become toxic and I can no longer work there. If the why’s are pertinent to answering the question I will fill them in. I want to leave on the spot but that will hurt my coworkers who are not toxic, it’s the boss who is. I just read through my employee contract, which I was basically forced into signing but did sign, and it states I have to give 60 days notice. What can my company do to me if I give two weeks notice? NAL - if it doesn't stipulate penalties, i imagine your risk of lawsuit depends on the damages that your sudden resignation would cause the business and their ability to prove it was as a direct result of your departure... could just be a CYA on their part contract-wise. Depending on your status in the organization or compensation, it might be worth it to pursue those damages, or might not.  Not basic, I am completely in the dark about everything pertaining to it so please ask anything. I don’t think so, it’s a lot of contract talk if that makes sense. It does say something about how if you breach the contract they can take you to court. And I’m in this sub so I’m not a lawyer but it only mentions two sections for that, the section on resigning is not specifically stated in the part about court.  Sorry for basic question, but does your signed contract stipulate what possible penalties could be?
