 I just dont see not being on call when needed over a long distance in dangerous weather is considered refusing suitable work Just on call when needed. Is this full time 40 hr a week work just per diem when needed. The stipulation of unemployment is you actively look for full time work not perdiem on call work. Is your boss calling you back to work full time 40/hr week work? Also, there may be an exception for refusing work over a certain distance. You can look for a new job and file for unemployment if fired. Your boss doesnâ€™t decide whether or not you receive UI.
