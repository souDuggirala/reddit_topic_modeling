 After a theft, my car was damaged, and I've been having a difficult time getting it restored to the pre-claim condition as is Florida Law. The big issue right now is that one panel is really trashed, and insurance is claiming that it was pre-existing damage and that they won't cover what seems to be both proper paint work and repair on almost half of the panel. I'm trying to understand what the adjustor is claiming, and looking back in previous pictures to see if I somehow didn't see very obvious damage, but it's not. Worse is that I took (phone) pictures in the tow yard before signing the release to insurance and I can't seem to see this damage from two angles in good daylight, though it appears very obvious in the adjustor's recent photos weeks after my pictures. So it appears either the towing company or body shop damaged it. As far as I can figure... I'm in no way responsible and wouldn't have to pay another deductible for this damage, correct? I've done a lot of searching online but I must be searching for the wrong thing. All I can find is that sometimes a shop's insurance would cover it, but usually something is signed to absolve them of warranty, and the same for tow companies. Do you have any references? That seems strange, that I'd have to pay for a tow shop or body shop damaging my car after I signed the release insurance told me I had to sign. You can complain and insist to your insurance that the damage was caused by the theft, but if they conclude it wasn't, you're out of luck.
