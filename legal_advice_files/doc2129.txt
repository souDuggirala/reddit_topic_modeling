 I had two charges, public intox and unlawful possession of prescription drugs. Both were dropped because I was on private property and have proof of prescription (the whole case report was crap and untruthful). I was appointed a public defender because I was out of work (laid off construction) and could not afford a private attorney. My lawyer laughed at my case and said it would be dropped because it was all crap, and it did get dropped. Never had to go to court, the lawyer just said it was all over (he was great). Now I'm having to pay for attorney fees and court costs (around $300).. Yes. If you use a public defender you can be charged for it. That is a lot less then a $2.5-5k bill from a private attorney.
