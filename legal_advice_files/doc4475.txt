 My friend is a citizen of the US and a resident of Florida. Her husband is a green card candidate from Siberia, they have been married for 1.5 years. Thing is now the friend is getting emotionally abused and is unable to leave the house, he follows her, he forbids her to have any friendships, etc. She claims he has not physically harmed her yet. They are renting an apartment together. What is her best options for getting out of this issue legally? Is she legally penalized for retracting the green card sponsorship for her husband? Does she have to resolve the green card issue before she can leave? Thanks so much for your advice.  /r/immigration is a better forum for this as they know the ins outs more. She should contact her local domestic violence organization for assistance. It depends on what stage of his green card they're at. She is welcome to divorce him, however by signing those sponsorship papers she agreed to be financially responsible for him. NAL so I'm unsure who the client is (the sponsor or the immigrant) if they used an immigration attorney. Until she knows the answer to that question she should only speak to her own attorney about divorce. You don't want someone like that getting a heads up. Best of luck to your friend.
