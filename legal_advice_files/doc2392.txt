 The officer said I wouldn’t have any points against my license and that when I pay it it’ll be over. I’m wondering if there’s any chance I’ll lose my license? I plan to plea guilty but I just want to know what this entitles. It’s my first offense, no priors. Any help will be appreciated  Thank you for your help  The officer was being nice. While still a moving violation this offense has no points in PA. If he had cited you for the speed there is a sliding scale for points based on how fast you were going.  Failure to obey a traffic control device. I.e a 45 mph speed limit sign. I was told I would get no points on my license  What kind of device did you disobey?
