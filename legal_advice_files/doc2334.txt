 I got a call from a debt collector saying I haven’t paid the full bill for a medical x-ray from April, 2017. They told me that the insurance only covered half of the bill but I don’t remember ever getting a bill or calls about a late payment from the medical facility. The company is now out of business. I do remember asking if insurance would cover the x-Ray and they told me yes. I was under my parents insurance at the time and they didn’t get any notification about this either. Do I pay the debt collection agency? How should I go about this?  It was weird the way the guy called me demanding I pay him over the phone. I did ask for an address and it took him awhile and he gave me a PO box. He did have my old address from two years ago but not my billing address, which is my parents house where I send all my billing documents. Thanks for the response!  Alright thank you for your response! I’ll do that first. "I demand written validation of the debt." I'd contact whomever was your insurance provider at the time to first verify this information.
