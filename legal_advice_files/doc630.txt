 My friend "Stacey" is a dental hygienist in a very small town. The dentist's boyfriend (also office manager) has been harassing the female hygienists. One of them was cornered in their basement by him, he grabbed her by the hair and started touching down her torso. He does this to all of them when they want a raise. He'll then ask them how badly they want the raise. He also recently found out that Stacey has an asmathic reaction to an office chemical. Apparently he tried to lure her into the closet where these chemicals are kept. She was smart enough to avoid him. I don't know if he has raped anyone, but the physical abuse and harassment is real and there are about 5 past co-workers who have confirmed this. If he hasn't raped anyone, we all fear that it's only a matter of time until it escalates to that point. We're from a very small town in West Virginia and the justice system here is rather lacking. As a third party in all of this, what should I do, or what advice should I give them? I can't stand the thought that these women have to go into this office because it's the only place for them to work at for miles around. Thank you, I'll pass along you and the previous commentor's advice.  She needs to be made aware so that action can be taken or the employees can consult with attorneys should she not act. On top of that, the victims need to file police reports about the boyfriends actions.  Thank you! I appreciate your advice. We're concerned that she (the dentist) is in on it. I realize of course these are crimes. I just wanted to make sure that I was taking the correct approach in bringing him to justice.  You're describing crimes, which can and should be reported to the police. Has the dentist or whoever has firing ability been made aware?  Anyone he has touched has a sexual assault case. If the local cops aren't listening, they should call the state police. Everyone else should be talking to an employment attorney.
