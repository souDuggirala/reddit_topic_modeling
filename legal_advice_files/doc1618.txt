 Alright so my Driver's license expired about a year ago. It hasn't been renewed because I have a warrant 4 hours away from 5 years ago. I can't afford to pay the warrant in full. And I definitely can't afford another $500 ticket for driving with an invalid license. Is it possible to call the county the warrant is in and set up a payment plan? Would I be able to renew my license while still making payments towards the payment plan or would I have to pay it all off before I could? Awesome thank you.  Generally, yes you can set up payment plans. You will need to call the county for any specifics. They can likely answer your question about when you can renew your license when you call.
