 My wife's company is being sold and the new company owners have shared their 401k contribution amounts with her. The formula the new company is using to determine how much 401k match they will provide looks like this... Each employee is given a 'score' which is Employee's Age + Years of Service to the Old Company. Given your score, the match percentages are... Score less than 50 - 2% match Score between 50 and 60 - 6% match Score greater than 60 - 8% match It doesn't take much to figure out that this matching strategy is much more favorable if you are an older employee. For example, if you've been at the old company for just 6 months, but are 60 years old, you get an 8% match. On the other hand, if you are 35 and have been with the old company for 13 years, you get just 2%. My question... is this legal? I found that the [Age Discrimination in Employment Act]() seems to protect workers over 40. Would this apply in this situation? Is there any recourse for workers under 40? Very interesting, thanks for sharing. I was assuming that these percentages were matches, but I'll ask my wife to see if they are actually non-elective employer contributions. Is it correct to assume though that it would be legal for employers to use this type of system with either type of contributions? Actually I'm not sure a state would want to get involved, as 401k plays are regulated by the federal gov't. Maybe Minnesota would as its age for protected class discrimination is 18, but regardless, Washington doesn't have this adjustment in class definition. Sorry, I left that out. She works in Washington state, but the company is mostly field-based employees working throughout the United States.  For example, this policy would be problematic in Minnesota.
