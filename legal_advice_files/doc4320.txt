 Hey all, i'm in Washington state and had a couple questions. Our landlord had to have the house repaired and it's been about a month now and he is currently paying for our hotel stay, my only question is he responsible for proving a equivalent or similar housing? I.e kitchen and everything we pay for in the house?  Thank you for your help, i was looking at that too. Figure ill just deal with the hotel since hes making a good faith effort instead of getting it done and billing him In skimming landlord tenant [state regulations ](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.18), it seems there are no provisions for replacement housing. Rather there’s provisions for the tenant to fix the problem (at the landlord’s expense) if the landlord is not on task.  It's a verbal month to month, so there is no physical contract. If the house is unlivable 0 bathrooms, leaks thru pipe and roofs, plumber had to come out and tell everyone to leave asap. Is he required to provide replacement housing at all? I wouldn’t think so unless it’s in your tenant contract. RCW probably gives you the option to terminate your lease.
