 So while I was in the car, I started feeling light headed. I realized something was wrong and looking at my phone, it started smoking from the charging port. I immediately released the wire and turned off the phone. I just want to know what I should do about this and I know I can't sue but this is quite dangerous for people who has a note 9 It's actually raining rn, I still smell the burnt ports, should I still get it fixed Has it been rainy lately? Charger cable ends dangling in water or even worse rock salty water, then being charged exhibits this behavior. This is a "common" cause of smoking phones Do you think, I would have to pay for something like a defective battery? Im afraid I would have to pay for more things for something like this  Maybe. I wouldn't bother with it though. Just worry about your phone I see a thread about Samsung vs this lady with the elevator, do you think my case can assist her? 1. Don't turn the phone on again or plug it in. 2. Call customer service 800-SAMSUNG. This isn't really a legal issue, but needs to be reported to the company to make it right. Sounds like you battery malfunctioned. Maybe manufacturer defect, maybe defective charger. It should be under warranty. I'm using a third party charger using a 2.4 a port When I removed the charger there was a leakage and some fluid on the port What charger were you using? I would contact Samsung and the manufacturer of the charger.
