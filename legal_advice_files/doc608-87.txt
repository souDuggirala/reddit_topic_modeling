Hey guys, I have an autistic friend that loves to go up to random people and make jokes and talk to them, it can seem like he is being creepy but he is just trying to make friends. Recently this girl reported him for stalking her when in reality he just wanted to talk to her and be friends. He was put in probation until may! Is there anyway he can fight this? He did absolutely nothing wrong.
