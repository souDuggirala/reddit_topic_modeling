 So my girls landlord called last night (I live here but not on lease) she had been delivered paperwork pertaining to my child support case by this lawyer. She spoke to him on the phone and he falsely told her he has spoken to my gf. We are married. (We aren’t) and dropped that we have a son (gf hadn’t told landlord about the child.) so he’s sending this paperwork to this landlord who doesn’t have anything to do with the case. He’s basically saying he’s trying to come after people other than me for child support. I need to call him but don’t want to be twisted up. This guy is a real douchbag. I won a custody case against him with no lawyer. I think he’s romantically involved with ex wife so it’s very personal. Any advice including any jargon with which I can use on this phone call? TIA.  He was trying to find out if my girl owns the house, lied about us being married basically trying to get our landlord to get fed up and scared. It’s an Alaska case so he sends me paperwork but he found out who owns the property and sent it to them, spoke on the phone, told her lies about me and his communication with her lesee... that seems outside his legal boundaries.  He’s an Alaska lawyer. Your first question should be whether or not he’s licensed in California. You can hire a lawyer to write a cease desist, but beyond that, not too much you can do at the moment.
