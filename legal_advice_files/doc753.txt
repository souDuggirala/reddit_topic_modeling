 To sum it up I worked a seasonal job with a major shipping company during the "christmas rush", I was promised a bonus check of $XXX as long as I was available to work M-Sa (which I was). I called after I received my check because I was short the amount of the bonus check I was promised. I called and they said the check I was given was for the actual hours I worked and that the bonus check would take two weeks to process and be ready to pick up, two weeks pass by and I call the morning of to confirm that the check is there and that my mother can pick it up for me as I'm at university, which the person on the phone confirmed was true. My mom came to pick up the check and she calls me saying that they said there is no check under that name or employee ID, I call the next morning and the lady says there's been a mix up and my check was mailed last night(Friday). I wait until the next Friday to make sure the check hasn't arrived and when my mom confirms it's not in the mail I call them again and the lady tells me she'll have her manager contact me back (didn't even ask for me info, but it's possible they could check caller ID or something). Never get a call back from said manager so I've called every day at around 9am and 3pm, the phone rings to voicemail and I know for a fact they're open so either I've been getting extremely unlucky or they've started ducking my calls. Is there anything I can do apart from "harassing" them with phone calls? Unless you have a promise of a bonus in writing, it would be hard to force the company to turn it over. Unfortunately, it was likely a lie told to get you (and others) on board. You can try contacting the labor department for your state, or try and find an employment lawyer that will do a free consult.
