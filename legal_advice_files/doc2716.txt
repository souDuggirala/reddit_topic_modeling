 Long story short: I'm a paramedic for an ambulance company. I have roughly 50 hours of accrued sick time. My county is in a transition phase between my current, failing company, and a larger ambulance company. Our workforce is being absorbed by the new company. We are unsure if our sick time will transfer over. It is likely not, as our current company is cashing out our vacation time. We have been told that our new jobs are contingent on medics and emts not calling off. If we do, there is a change our new job could be rescinded. Is there a way to use the sick time without calling off? Or to force payment of sick time? My understanding is that it is \not\ guaranteed, but I'm hoping for a loophole. The value of my sick time is about $700.  Do not resign. Force them to terminate you so you can collect unemployment. The vacation will need to be paid to you but the sick time may not in CA. Then that is your answer unfortunately... use it or lose it, but there may be consequences.  Our current company has sent out a letter saying all employees are terminated effective this week and that we can either resign or be terminated en masse. We are not unionized. The new company is only offering conditional employment to the current workforce; they are not taking any supplies or company assets with them.  Even in California sick time is generally a protected asset that must be paid out on termination. Don't use it... it's gone. This doesn't necessarily sound like a termination though but a merger / absorption. Benefit carryover will depend on the merger agreement. Are you guys unionized?
