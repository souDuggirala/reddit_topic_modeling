So i sold an iphone x to someone for 735$ and i shipped it to them. They said they paid it was just processing the payment through paypal. But i yet to recieve payment after 48 hours. They said they would send me bank statements saying the payment went through but they have neglected to send to them to me and now are ignoring me. Is this fraud or scamming? What can i do about this.  I wasn’t really serious. But when I go to the store I’m leaving with the item in hand. I was just making a point that buyer/seller could potentially get scammed.  So when you order from a retailer online, you don't pay until they ship your product? They won't ship your product until the payment is processed. Also, PayPal always favors the buyer, the seller, if shipping the product before receiving payment, is literally just sending free product because there is nothing to guarantee the buyer will pay. Why should they? Product has been shipped.  When you go to the store, does your receipt print before or after your payment is processed? [deleted] [removed] [deleted] Yup, you've been scammed. &gt; I showed paypal this and they said it was fraud.


That's pretty much your answer then. Can you put for the package to be turned around (if it hasn't been delivered yet)? If it has been delivered, you'll need to sue the person.  Next time don't send anything until the money is confirmed in your account. This screams fraud to me. Paypal had said this looks to appear like fraud because she doesnt have the funds to pay for it. I requested 735$ and she sent what appears to be a reciept of 735$ of her sending the money but it says pending. I showed paypal this and they said it was fraud. Do you see this payment anywhere on your paypal, or are you just taking their word for it?
