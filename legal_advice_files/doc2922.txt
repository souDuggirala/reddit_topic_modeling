 New business, signed a commercial lease (w/ personal guarantee) October 2015. Business had poor cash flow, subsequently sold interest in March 2017. Informed landlord would be vacating with 90 days advance notice, but continued making full, timely rent payments. At Landlords direction, I put a for lease sign out front, and listed on CL. Lots of bites, no takers. In July of 2017, i asked the Landlord if he would consider a buyout, and he declined, without negotiation. I paid rent in full and on time until June 2018, at which time proceeds from sale ran out and I informed the landlord that after 15 months of vacancy I couldn’t keep paying. On June 14, he sent a demand email, stating default and referral to his attorney. On June 20, I cashed in an IRA and paid him for June and July. That weekend, I found the locks had been changed. Within 30 days, he had a tenant in the unit. I asked for a copy of the new lease (beginning 9/1/18) and the landlord refused on the grounds of tenant privacy. He did obtain permission to “show me” the lease. The difference between my lease and the new one is $360/mo. I have asked the landlord twice for an accounting statement of what has been paid, and what is owed. He said he would provide, but had not done so for 5 months. In our last phone conversation, he said lease terminated and defaulted in June 2018. When I repeated this back to him at the end of the conversation he denied saying it. I got off the phone for fear of calling him a goddamn liar. Haven’t spoken since. Suggestions? Keep paying or cut off payments?
