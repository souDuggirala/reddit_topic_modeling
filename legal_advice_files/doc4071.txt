 I got a parking ticket but it contains 2 incorrect digits on my license plate and the wrong model car. It does have the correct last 4 of my VIN, but not the whole thing. I was going to dispute it for other reasons, but seeing this made me wonder if I should even bother since it seems like they will not be able to identify me through the info they captured. Thoughts? Theres a chance they have the correct info on camera of on the other copy of the ticket, maybe.. maybe not... Either way a clerical error doesnâ€™t void the ticket.
