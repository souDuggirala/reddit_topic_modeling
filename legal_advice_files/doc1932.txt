 So I was pulled over for not wearing a seat belt. My buddy was also in the parking lot, where I was pulled over, and he knew the officer. So he went up to him and told him that he should let me off. After they were talking for a bit, I proceeded to walk back to the police car. When I arrived to his window, he said he was letting me off. I then proceeded to make the mistake of mentioning that I took it off right before he saw me. He asked why and I responded to him saying that it was because I was almost to my destination. He asked why I would take it off and then put it back on. I could tell he was considering giving me a ticket now so I thanked him and he drove off. I was reviewing the FOIA video that I received and after he drove away he called into dispatch mumbling something that mentioned "warning". Here's the catch, a week later I received a violation citation (ticket) for $50.00 from the failure to wear a properly adjusted seat belt. Is he allowed to issue this after the fact that he let me go? My hearing is tomorrow. Any advice on what I should use for an argument would be much appreciated! Great news! The attorney found it odd that I was mailed the ticket. I showed them the video footage and I was cleared of the charge Yupp F'ed up, just pay the $50 at this point   . Any advice on what I should use for an argument would be much appreciated! You do not have a legal defense. Prepare to pay for the ticket. And wear your seat belt next time. Beyond the legal issues, it makes it much more likely you will survive or be hurt less in a car crash.
