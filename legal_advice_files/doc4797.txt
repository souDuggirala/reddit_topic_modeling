 Hi, all. Sorry for the odd formatting. I’m on mobile. I’m currently in a 12-month lease with my ex. We have a child, together. We’ve been able to hash out a custody agreement on our own, however, certain things came to light that concern me for his safety. He’s admitted to self-harm with the intention of suicide. This was when I was at work, and our daughter was asleep. There has been only one instance of this. I believe his intentions are to leave the lease, but I’m not sure. One moment he says that he will stay, the next moment he thinks that he will up and leave. He thinks I am an unfit mother due to the circumstances that broke our relationship up- none related to our child. I’m starting to become concerned for everyone’s safety in the matter. There’s nothing but hostile closed-door conversations. I’m not allowed to have people over, but he is able to have various romantic partners over. Looking over leasing laws for the state, I can’t seem to find anything that would be applicable to break the lease. Also, if the lease breaks, I’m unsure of how custody will pan out, as he wants nothing less than half. I don’t have much proof of anything, and I cannot afford a lawyer. I’ve called the suicide hotline, but the didn’t provide any resources or help. I feel like I’m running out of time, and I need some sort of path to get things rolling. Thanks for reading.
