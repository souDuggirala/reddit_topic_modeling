 I’m in Portland Oregon. I just recently got a promotion at my job. My manager said that it would come with a $2 pay increase. Come to find out after I accepted the position that it was in fact a .75 cent increase. After discussing with my manager she said it was indeed .75 cent increase and she was also given wrong information. The person who told her and me that I would be getting a $2 increase is now no longer with the company. Is there any action I can take? I’m considering filing a wage claim. How likely is it that I’ll be able to get the $2 increase I was promised? You can file a wage claim for the hours worked between when you were promised $2 and when you learned that you were getting $.75. You won't be able to make them pay you the $2 for any time after you were notified of the correct rate.
