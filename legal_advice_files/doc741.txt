 When I first paid $1.6k for my dining hall pass to my university, The hours I paid for on Fridays were until 8pm. Now, without any warning, they have changed the hours to close at 7pm. It may seem petty, but I rely on this hall for all my food. And I would not have paid for the meal plan if I had known it would close at 7. As well, I wouldn't have chosen to have two three-hour long classes back to back. my first class begins at 1, goes to 3:15, and then my next class is from 3:30 into 7:30. I did this so I would have time to finish, get food, go home. But now I have to eat dinner before my first class. They changed the schedule with no warning and the original, paid for, agreed upon time was until 8. Do I have any legal grounds to get a refund or does this just seem petty? I am extremely upset with this change as changing my classes would now cost me money, and these classes are vital to my degree and are filled for the other times of the week. Thanks for any help. NAL and not legal advice, but I do have experience working in University housing. Often, dining halls provide brown-bag meals you can order and pick-up. This would enable you to eat dinner using your meal plan. You should inquire about that. What did the University say when you complained?
