 I have a job a at grocery store in New Jersey. The fees they are charging me are not benefiting me and are taking most of my paycheck. Can I opt out of a union? Or say I don't want to pay the fees? Az is a right to work and at will state. You don't have to join a union, and can be fired/quit at any time (with no prior notification). I see, what would happen if op for example started working somewhere and after he starts, a union is created in there? Also, is this the same in Arizona? There are no options. OP is in NJ. Therefore OP doesn't have the legal right to work in a union shop without being a union member. OP's options are to maintain union membership or go find a job in a workplace without a union. Everything else is purely political and this isn't the place for it. Well, I'm asking because I'm trying to understand the legal part of it, and what options are there, not so much as a discussion on what should be in reality and those kind of things This isn't the right place for that discussion. I just don't like Orwellian political marketing concepts being enshrined into everyday discourse. "Right to work" was chosen for this type of legislation because it sounds better than "Union busting." Is it really thaaaat bad?? Or right to work with whatever wage you negotiate and earn.  New Jersey you can have an agency shop or a closed shop, which means that you have to pay dues. If you don't like it and don't think they are doing much for you, it might be a good idea to get active in your union.  The rest of that phrase is "the right to work for minimum wage with no benefits." It's based on state law, and there is no such law in New Jersey. I believe I did not fully understand what right to work meant.  You have no legal right to do that in New Jersey. Wait, isn't this part of the right to work? You would need to ask if your job allows to not be part of the union and still work there.
