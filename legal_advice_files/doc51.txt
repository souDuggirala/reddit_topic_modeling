 My sister moved into a place that was $800 the first month and then dropped to $600 from there. One of the tenants is now saying that didn’t include utilities even though he explained it was $800 everything included and will then be $600 from there on out. When she moved in there was no WiFi, as the tenants ex had taken it. So we assume that extra $200 was used for things his ex girlfriend had taken with her. What are my sisters rights in this situation? I’m fairly angry for her as the room she is renting isn’t even worth $600. The bathroom is covered in black mold, the floor has severe water damage, and the other tenants never clean after their dogs - haven’t mopped the floors in god knows how long and overall, the house is a complete dump. This is in Oregon and her second month living there. She doesn’t. The house is handled by a very immature 25 year old and she was in a vulnerable spot so had a find a place quickly. Does she have a lease?
