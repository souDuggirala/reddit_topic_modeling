 This is in Orange, California the shower got clogged recently so I called to get it fixed and when I checked my bill there was an $100 hair clog charge. That didn’t seem right to me since it was normal wear and tear. Additionally the A/C was spotty but they assured me I could use it and I have records of this, but when it broke they charged me and went back on their word and said in the bill they told me not to use it. Here’s I responded initially you guys know more? Inserted pics are bill and email I sent back. [photos]() You live alone? No long haired house guess? Hair is 100% a maintenance issues and most likely was started by a previous tenant but that will be hard to prove. AC is definitely the LLs issue. As a short hair guy who has never seen hair fall in the shower I’d like to think so? Hair in a drain is not “normal wear and tear”.  The ac they can’t charge you for, if you weren’t supposed to use it they should have disabled it to prevent you from doing so. There’s a breaker on 99% of all ac units if it’s an outside ac unit. Or they could have removed the thermostat. Mention something called lock out tag out when you mention the charge and OSHA.
