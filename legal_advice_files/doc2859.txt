 Hello! I live in a house in Denver, Colorado with two other roommates. On Sunday, we recognized a flood in our basement, and notified our landlord immediately. It was not until Thursday that someone came out to see how bad it actually was (after sending reminders via text that the flood was still there). We had a clogged pipe (due to tree roots, no evidence was found for negligence on our part) and sewage water had consumed 3/4ths of the \~150sq foot basement. This water touched many walls in the basement (unfinished, but has drywall up to make little rooms within the basement). The original restoration company was saying affected dry wall needed to be removed, the basement needed to be sealed off, and hvac vents should be sealed off to stop airflow into the rest of the house. Today (Friday), a different company shows up to assess and do the work. However, they said they were only going to remove the carpet, and spray microban on everything (not removing affected walls). After trying to educate myself on the topic, I'm weary that this new company (that quoted our landlord less) is not going to take care of the situation the way it needs to be. I found basic steps online for Category 3 water flooding and it states "remove and discard all contaminated porous and semi-porous structural materials." Our lease also states "Landlord represents that the Premises and the building in which the Premises are located are fit for human habitation and that the Premises are fit for use as a private dwelling." Do we have any pull to state that the contaminated walls need to be removed? Or the basement needs to sealed off? Or the HVAC vents need to be cleaned because they can possibly be contaminated with fecal matter?
