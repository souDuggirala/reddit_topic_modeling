 This is in CA. I got a dog off Craigslist and about a week in, the dog started displaying Happy tail. I was told the owner didn’t want the tail docked but as the issue went on and got more serious I went to the vet and amputation was recommended. I couldn’t afford it so I asked the owner what they wanted me to do, they insisted it was never an issue but later said that the dog did often hit his tail on walls. I said I would keep trying to heal it but was unable to so offered her the dog back. I would have surrendered to shelter but the owner wanted to take the dog back. They said if amputation is needed I will have to pay half. I did not pay for his dog, there was never a sale, I had it for about a month. I didn’t want to agree because if I could afford half, I would have kept the dog but I felt if I didn’t agree that they wouldn’t take the dog back and I couldn’t afford to keep it due to the condition or stalk or threaten me if I gave the dog up to a shelter. I have back the dog and they had a written contract by her 13 year old daughter and was told to sign with my name and address. I felt very uncomfortable doing this but was under so much stress from the situation and lack of sleep because I was so emotionally attached to the dog. I half heartedly signed and left. I can’t afford half of the cost. It’s not my dog anymore, if they can’t afford it they should surrender the dog like I wanted to. They never offered to pay half when I said I couldn’t afford it and was still trying to keep the dog. can I really be sued over this if they decide to go through with the procedure?  So this should be a lesson that you're not ready to own a dog. It is unlikely that they could sue you for half unless that is part of what you signed.
