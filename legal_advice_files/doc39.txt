 I live in alberta, and moved into a home back in may through a rental company. The place at first seemed fine minus a few issues they said they would take care of. After living here for 5 months now black mold has shown up in the basement, little black beetles are constantly crawling in the basement, and none of the previous issues have been fixed. Previous issues were tree triming (city has dropped notices), a loose stone on the walk way (canada post has since stopped delivering mail due to it being unsafe), driveway was supposed to be leveled with gravel due to an unsafe drop. Yesterday they came to look at the mold, took pictures and left without giving any information of plans to fix the issue. They keep saying theyll have to contact the owners of the property to address the issues. I've since withheld rent for this month due to mainly the mold but as well as the other issues. I had told them on the phone that rent was being held until I was notified of what was going to be done which I was told was fine. Today I find a late rent notice on the door. Is there anything I can do legally to protect myself from extra charges as well as getting out of the lease without losing my damage deposit? INAL and not from Canada. But from what I can find, you cannot stop paying rent while waiting for repairs to be completed. Pay the rent, pay any late fees or you risk being evicted. []() You might be able to repair and deduct, bu there is a process for that and it's more than a phone call. []() has more.  You are not allowed to withhold rent. As you've discovered, doing so will get you evicted. By law, you are supposed to resolve residential tenancy disputes by filing an application for dispute resolution: []() The tribunal has the power to order the landlord to make repairs, to reimburse you for any damaged belongings, to provide a rent rebate for the loss of enjoyment, and in extreme cases to let you out of your lease.
