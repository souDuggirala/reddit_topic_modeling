 At this stop you can only turn right or left. I had my blinker on and had to pull a little ahead of the sign to see around the corner. Waited for four cars to pass before turning right. Was immediately pulled over and ticketed for failure to stop. What can I do in this situation? I had a friend in the car with me who witnessed everything.  Yes. It’s a road I frequent and cops tend to love that corner so I’m always extra careful to abide by the laws there Did you stop behind the stop sign before you pulled forward to get a view of the road? You can try to take it to court but unless you have some other evidence it's unlikely that your own and your friends testimony alone will be enough to refute the police officers.
