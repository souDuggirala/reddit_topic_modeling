 So in Illinois it's gonna be around $350-400 to change my last name. But in Indiana it's about $150-200. Would I be able to just do it at a court house in Indiana or do I have to change it in the county I live in? You can't do it in Indiana if you don't live there [Indiana Code ยง34-28-2-2](): Most (all?) jurisdictions will have a similar requirement, so you'd have to do it in the county where you live You most likely have to do this in the county and state where you reside.
