My stepmother made a verbal contract with me and my sister as my dad was dying in hospice. "You both will never have to go without money or want for anything ever again".. I have 5 witnesses. Is this admissible and worth pursuing. Thank you. That is in no way a contract.  Thank you king Wow! I'm glad to have learned this. Thank you.  You’re not offering any consideration. “You get $5k for continuing to exist” isn’t an enforceable contract. There’s no consideration on your behalf, legally speaking.  Okay at one point she mentioned a dollar amount 4k Thank you  Here’s a less jargon-y and longer explanation: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration
 
A lease agreement has consideration for both parties, he LL is being paid rent, the renter is getting a premise. The rent and the premise are consideration. 
 
It also generally can’t be nominal.  The vagueness isn't the problem here. The problem is that a promise to do something, without receiving anything back, is not an enforceable contract.

For example: "I promise to give you a million dollars on your birthday" is not enforceable, even if it's in writing.  Thank you It is very vague true but,  it means more than,  you get not one penny  &gt; Something bargained for and received by a promisor from a promisee.  Common types of consideration include real or personal property, a return promise, some act, or a forbearance.  Consideration or a valid substitute is required to have a contract.
 
Cornell law edu  Usa, yes. What is considered a consideration? Thank you That isn't a contract, those are just kind words that were not honored. Verbal contracts are enforceable contracts if you can prove them, however that statement is incredibly vague and open to interpretation. That is not a contract.

A contract requires an offer, consideration and acceptance.

In your situation, you have no considerations (assuming USA).
