 Hi, I am just asking for advice on this matter. Basically, I live in WA State in Seattle, and a month ago (November 27th), I had somebody takeover my lease for my apartment, effectively moving out. I was told by the apartment management that I would receive my refund check for the last month's of rent I pre-paid, and my security deposit. Obviously, I have not gotten it yet, contacting them, they said that some problems happened, and with holidays as well, I haven't gotten it yet. Reading this I see that by Washington laws, I must have received my deposit by 21 days or else. My question is, what exactly can I do now to receive it as soon as possible? The apartment management hasn't even mailed it out yet, and it's becoming annoying at this point. [removed]
