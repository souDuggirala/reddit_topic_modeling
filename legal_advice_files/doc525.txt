 I became an Audi A4 owner for the thrill of owning an AWD turbo luxury car. The car was everything I wanted for the first few months but has since become the black cloud hanging over my life. The car has been a disaster and my local Audi dealership and Audi USA have made my experience even worse. Here's a pretty detailed timeline of everything I've encountered with my car as I've wanted to keep everything well documented. I've added a bit of commentary where I feel it's necessary and also omitted specific detail (dealership/repair shop name) etc. Sorry for the length but that's Audi's fault - tl;dr at the bottom with questions and newly learned information. I appreciate anyone taking the time to read this and give their opinion. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1/21/16 - 41,343 Miles 2012 Audi A4 was purchased from a local Audi (Pennsylvania) as used, not certified pre-owned.

Called salesman at local Audi and he suggested I have the car towed to their shop. · Fuel Injectors replaced · Intake manifold gasket replaced The dealership covered the cost of repairs as well as the fuel injectors. They were a known issue to shut down the ECU, this was covered under an extended warranty (extended coverage to 10 years/120,000 miles - class action?) \[Tow paid out of pocket\] 8/1/16 - 44,126 Miles Gradually started realizing a slipping clutch until one day it eventually gave out leaving the car immobile, on or about August 1st, 2016. Had the car towed to local Audi \[Tow paid out of pocket\]. Reached out to my salesman at Audi who offered zero direction and passed my information to the service manager; o 8/6/16 Received voicemail from service manager quoting the job at $4,700 for a clutch kit and flywheel. o 8/12/16 After doing my own research and talking with mechanics I was able to get quoted for $2,200.

Have car towed and serviced at local Audi. Replaced the starter and 3 fuses \[$1,273.60 out of pocket\] \[Towed paid out of pocket\] \\Around this time we found out my father had lymphoma. Without getting into too much detail I essentially left my job and took over the family business an hour from where I lived. I was driving a good amount daily as that's the nature of the business, so that accounts for the increased usage from here out\\ 12/5/17 58,005 Miles Oil Change/Fluid/Filter Checks at local repair shop (At this point I've paid the balance of the loan for my car to help close on a house) 3/1/18 \~ 66,000 Miles Inspection runs out and at this point I’m using my father’s SUV for the most purposes. I planned to sell the vehicle as soon as possible because I barely used it but life kinda got in the way. 10/1/18 - 70,001 Miles \\This is the last time I've seen my A4\\ Car starts to shut down while driving, immediately take the car to the nearest garage. Schedule a tow to local Audi 2 (I'm about an hour from original Audi) and planned service for 10/12/18. \[Tow paid out of pocket\] 10/13/18 - 70,001 Miles o 12:09PM Receive call from service adviser at local Audi 2 who explained that the fuel injectors needed to be replaced, again. He also suggested 75,000 Mile Service package, front/rear brakes, 2 tires, and Inspection/Emissions for a total of $2,585.06 o 12:46PM Get a copy of the estimate emailed to me by service adviser o 12:50PM Receive email from service adviser: “Just got off the phone with my tech, he put the new injector in there and tried spark plugs just to see what would happen, and the vehicle needs an engine, cylinder 1 only have 30 pounds of pressure. Call me at the number below asap.” o 1:15PM Spoke with the service adviser at local Audi 2 who said all-in for the engine would be “about $17,000”. \\I spent the next 3 weeks contacting every single person I could find at Audi USA and the ownership group of the local Audi I bought the car from. Zero response. Zero follow up. This will soon become a trend\\ 11/4/18 Demanded answers from the service manager at Audi Allentown who finally emailed the below answers to my questions; 1. What codes appeared on the diagnostics when the car first came into the shop? P030200 cyl. 2 Misfire Detected P030000 Random / Multiple cylinder misfire detected VAG02635 Tuner not enabled / activated P130A00 Hide Cylinder (this is a fault stating that the failed fuel injector has been shut down by the ECU due to multiple misfire faults) VAG03542 Wheel diameter implausible VAG01274 Back pressure door motor VAG03157 Function restriction due to communication interruption What happened in the time between my car just needing fuel injectors (for the 2nd time in 30k miles) to an entirely new engine? - After the fuel injector was replaced the vehicle was still running poorly, at this time the technician replaced the spark plugs at no charge to the customer, this did not cure the situation. We found the cylinder 1 spark plug is getting oil soaked. He then performed a compression test and found cylinder 1 has low compression. Cylinder is most likely scored, this would require engine replacement to correct. Why wasn't this supposed engine failure diagnosed immediately when I brought the car in? - The vehicle had a failed fuel injector not supplying fuel to cylinder 2, there would be no reason to dig deeper or to suspect a further failure until this fuel injector was repaired 11/6/18 - current Drove directly to local Audi 1 and had a meeting with the general manager and explained the situation in its entirety. He agreed to have the car towed to Audi 1 for diagnostics on 11/7/18. o 11/9/18 Received an update that my car was up next in the shop o 11/12/18-11/16/18 Left 3 unreturned voicemails to general manager o 11/19/18 Emailed general manager for an update o 11/20/18 Finally spoke with general manager. He said the shop would need to tear down the engine to see if a cylinder replacement was feasible, that there was scoring in cylinder 2. Mentioned he spoke to the local Audi USA representative about helping to cover some of the cost for engine tear down (\~$2,000). Told me he’d reach out to the Audi representative ‘first thing 11/21/18’ o 11/27/18 Emailed general manager for an update on car and Audi USA’s offer as I hadn’t heard anything o 11/29/18 Followed up on 11/27/18 email asking why Audi can never deliver on what they say. Receive call from general manager 10 minutes after email was sent that "I’m not entitled to any help and I should be appreciative of anything I get." o 12/4/18 Get email from general manager that he just got off the phone with Audi USA. Said they’re going to do “something” to help me and he’d have final confirmation later that night. Asked for past service records and asked if it had been serviced at any Audi dealerships (Yeah, open up your computer and search) o 12/4/18 Responded to general manager later that day explaining everything above and service history at Audi 1 and most recently Audi 2. Explained any general maintenance (oil changes etc.) were completed at local repair shop and that after speaking with the owner anything should be available in the online system. o 12/13/18 Emailed general manager as I hadn’t heard anything in 9 days o 12/18/18 Emailed general manager asking what they needed from me, asking about the status of the tear down, and Audi USA’s communication. o 12/18/18 Received email from general manager stating he’d call me tomorrow to discuss everything. He just left an email with Audi USA rep and they were going to speak that night. o 12/26/18 Emailed general manager asking status of everything we’ve talked about. o 1/4/19 Received voicemail from general manager stating my car was next up on the queue o 1/8/19 Spoke with general manager. Said that Audi USA was going to help cover the cost of tearing down the engine to make sure cylinder could be rebuilt. He mentioned they could also potentially cover some of the approximate \~$7,000 cost. I asked for any of this in writing and he said that this would not be possible. o 1/16/19 Left voicemail for general manager about update o 1/24/19 Received call from assistant service manager at Audi 1 giving me a non-committal update on my car and asked for all service records, I told him to contact local repair shop for anything not performed at an Audi dealership o 1/24/19 Received follow up email from assistant service manager at Audi Willow Grove summarizing our phone call, stating he reached out to local repair shop who would provide service records. o 1/28/19 Called local repair shop to ask about sending records to assistance service manager. Owner told me he spoke to Audi and that all records are available online in the dealer system and Carfax. Owner told me that assistant service manager claimed Carfax isn’t sufficient. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ At this point I haven't seen my car since the 1st of October last year. I'm going backwards down the chain of command and I've exhausted every resource I think I have available. I'm now just apathetic towards the whole experience I've had with my car and Audi. I just want it to end. Just for happenstance I decided to personally pay for and run a carfax of my car and find this - !Local Audi Service 12/1/15 - 41,000 Miles!&lt; !· Crankshaft oil seal replaced (previous oil leaking problem?)!&lt; !· Transmission removed and reinstalled (wtf???)!&lt; The legal/mechanic questions I'm asking through this whole ordeal now are - 1. Fuel Injectors - This is a known problem and they've failed me twice in under 30,000 miles, could this failure have caused the scoring issue within the cylinder? Is Audi's extended warranty responsible for engine damage caused due to this? Has this been litigated anywhere? 2. The local Audi purchased this car and per their own input removed the transmission and reinstalled a month before selling this to me. This is not a common occurrence at this mileage, is this correct? Could this have been dealer code for other services? Would I be able to ask (subpoena) the Audi dealership for records of the car before I owned it? Could this service have been a precursor to my issues? tl;dr - My 2012 Audi A4 has been a piece of garbage and the only thing worse has been the service through my local Audi dealer and Audi USA. My car has broken down 4 times in under 30,000 miles and now I'm facing a blown engine repair that's higher than my car's kelly blue book value.  I’m happy with my Toyota  Thanks for the detailed response. The only thing left would be the extended warranty of the fuel injectors. Sometime in 2012 Audi of America sent a letter to all owners of the 2.0 TFSI engine that it had been extended to 10 years/100k miles. In the letter it cited "may cause misfire conditions"   My dad still adds wiper fluid to my car, I have no clue how you can or can't damage a cylinder. The legal issue you seem to be hinting at is a failure to disclose, but they don't have an obligation to disclose any previous work or damage to you. They cannot lie to you, so if they had said we replaced the whole transmission a week ago and you later foudn out that it was never replaced you would have a complaint, in a legal sense. In your state you do have some protection. Cars must be "roadworthy" but that only means that at the time of sale they cannot have: A bent, cracked or twisted frame A cracked head or engine block An inability to pass a state inspection A tranmission that is damaged, defective or so deteriorated that it must be replaced Flood damage A differential that is so damaged, defective or deteriorated that it must be replaced.  Pennsylvania, so I found there could potentially be some protection? My two main issues are firstly the transmission being replaced at 40k miles, 3k miles before it went again. And the fuel injector, could this have been the cause of the damaged cylinder? Could this be argued that it should be covered under the extended warranty of 100k miles? Did you buy a warranty with the car?  To answer everyone, yes I bought the car in used as in condition. I've read that Pennsylvania (where the car was purchased) does offer some used car protection unlike other states. The fuel injector issue I think was a class action lawsuit, which is why the warranty is extended to 100k miles. Could this failure of the fuel injector have caused the catastrophic scoring in the engine cylinder because it wasn't getting enough fuel?  Okay whats the legal issue? German cars can be expensive to fix and used cars may break a lot. If you don't have a warranty I'm not sure what you're looking for.  There are too many words here, you'd do better if you cut it down by like 90%.  So you bought this car without any sort of warranty as a used vehicle in as-in condition?
