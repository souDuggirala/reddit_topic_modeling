 As the title says, the envelope that had my wife’s W-2 for her old job was open. It wasn’t ripped open, it was just never properly closed. The seal wasn’t even licked. So her SSN and other personal info could have easily been pulled out and looked at the entire time it was being delivered. Is there a procedure when something like this happens? Or are we SOL? Automation stuffs and seals envelopes, then adds postage. Hers was just not sealed properly by a machine.  Dude, if I was going to steal her SSN from her W2 I wouldn't have left the W2 there. I would have taken it and you'd never know it was opened. Don't worry about it. Okay. Thanks for the response. Not too worried about it since I’m sure it was just mixed in with all the other mail. But good to know just to know.  If you can claim damages as a result, sure, but otherwise there's nothing you can do. You're not SOL but rather overreacting.
