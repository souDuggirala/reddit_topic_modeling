 Hello, I hope this is the right place to post this. My question is regarding benefits such as Temporary Disability when moving between states. The situation is my wife and I are expecting our first child in a few months and her job doesnt offer anything above FMLA as far as taking time off. Because of this, we were relying on getting the NJ (where she works) FLI/Temporary Disability for child birth. Just recently her job informed her (well her whole office) that they are shutting down their NJ office and moving to Philadelphia. What I wanted to know is what options are available for her. Does she still qualify for NJ benefits or are we out of luck? I reached out to the state for information, but who knows how long it will take them to respond. Thank you
