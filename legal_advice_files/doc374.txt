 Phone, not native English speaker yada yada Hello, for the last two days I felt quite bad luckily I had off for those so thought I'll get better before my Sunday shift-nope still feverish, dizzy and shivering all over the place. Can't breathe and have problems with walking due to body ache. I did told my manager that I won't be able to work as I don't think it's safe for me to work tommorow. I work in small food shop, there's usually only one person in Sundays on shift. After few hours he told me that no one can cover my shift and I have to come to work. I will. I have no other choice, I'm scared I'll get worse after, and if I will--what should I do from legal stand point to not get fired? For the last 4 months I've worked here, I've covered/stayed longer multiple times and never called in sick, Ive gone to work even after night of vomiting but this time flu is just destroying me. I'm scared ill lose my job if I'll get worse after tomorrow. UK. Any advices? Is there ways I can secure myself in case if things go down?  Make sure to try r/LegalAdviceUK
