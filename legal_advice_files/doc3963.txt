 As the title states I was just granted a new trial after the previous one the judgement was defaulted. The court has said that I need to serve the girl the paperwork. How do I go about serving her?  I have found a private service company, thank you so much!  Hire a private service company or look up your local court rules for what is required to provide appropriate service.
