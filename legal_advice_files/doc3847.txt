 Ok. So I was t-boned at an intersection, she had a stop sign, I didn’t. My door will not open from the outside and I’ve been driving someone else’s car. It was reported to her insurance last Friday, the adjuster called me yesterday to get a statement and she’s still waiting to hear back from the other driver. I need to get my car fixed ASAP, I need a rental ASAP but I am not reporting this to my insurance. What can I do?  Im sorry for another comments, but I was in an accident a month ago and at the scene the police said the other driver was at fault, the insurance company sent me a letter saying the accident is my fault. Contact your insurance because they are going to do anything in their power to fuck you. Why would you not get your own insurance involved? Uhm. Why would you not also report this to your insurance. If it isn't your fault they will work to get your settlement/compensation faster? Pay for them out of pocket and then hopefully get reimbursed. But you cannot make someone elses insurance work faster. Or give you anything. They are not there for you. They are there to protect their interests and their clients.
