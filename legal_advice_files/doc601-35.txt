My property manager had sent out a renewal reminder in October with the renewal rate lower than my current monthly rate. When my wife and I expressed interest to renew at this rate, they said that notice was accidentally sent out and that they could do us a favor and hold our rate at where it is. We feel that the renewal rate is actually fair and that we're overpaying compared to other tenants who filled in spots later than we did that got promotional discounts.

They're falling back on their flyer being an accident and they won't take own up to the advertised rate.

Are they in violation of any sort of laws or are they just demonstrating terrible business practice?

I'm in Kansas if that makes a difference. Thanks in advance! Thanks for the quick reply! No violation of any laws here.  If a business makes an error in advertising a price, they do not have to honor the falsely advertised price.  No contract was created here, so nothing can be done.
