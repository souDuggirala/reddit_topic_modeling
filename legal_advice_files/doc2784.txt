 So recently, I moved into an apartment. Really great place for what I pay. I moved in with a co-worker of mine, to which me and him have no problems, I should add. A buddy of mine was going to move in with us. We paid a deposit so that way the apartment could be held for us until we moved in. $500 which would go towards first and last months rent, which was told to us on multiple occasions by the landlord that it was non-refundable. This "buddy" of mine paid $160. Me and my co-worker paid $170. He backed out of moving in a week before we all planned on moving in. Long story short, I let him borrow one of my PS4's since his died, so he had something to use. He is refusing to return my PS4 until he gets his non-refundable $160 back. What is my best course of action? Thank you. I appreciate you. I would start at your local police station. I live in a different town than him. Should I contact state police, my towns police, or his towns police? File a police report. Non refundable isnâ€™t your responsibility.
