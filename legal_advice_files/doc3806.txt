 My girlfriend recently switched birth control from an iud to depo shot. The office keeps giving her incorrect reminder dates for her appointments, causing her to miss the actual appt with her Dr, and to not be able to relay pertinent information and ask questions. I feel like not only is this unprofessional , but also dangerous to her health and illegal. Any help is appreciated.
