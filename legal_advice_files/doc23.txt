 Few weeks back our neighbors filed a complaint to the panchayat that we had not left full 3 meters from the property line and they have also filed a complaint in Block Development Office, and this complaint is preventing us from getting our trading liscence. What necessary legal steps can we take without demolishing a part of our shop?
