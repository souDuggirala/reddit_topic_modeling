 My boss has been... difficult, in a manner of speaking (nicely), and I have a feeling a conversation is coming that I probably can't avoid. I won't get too emotional in this post, just suffice it to say that I have NEVER had so many issues with a person. Generally I am well liked, and I am an easy going person. She just does not care for me, for whatever reason, and basically nothing that I do is right in her eyes. What I would like to know is that if she does want to sit down and have a conversation with me, am I allowed to record it? I don't want to do it sneakily either. I would like to make it known that I plan to record the conversation for my reference. But I want to know if I am allowed to record it whether she "wants me to" or not. I feel like I should have some protection when it comes to this sort of thing but I can't find anything on the internet giving me a straight answer. Everything I have found is someone wanting to "wire-tap" or record a conversation without the other person's knowledge, which again, is not what I want to to. Any help with this is much appreciated! Happy 2019 everyone. TL;DR - Boss sucks and is probably going to call a meeting with me. I'd like to record the conversation but be upfront about it and tell her I am recording whether she wants me to or not. Is this legal in Missouri? You can record the conversation, and she is free to fire you for it. Not sure what you're hoping to achieve. If I were you, I'd just start looking for a new job.  Missouri is a one-party recording consent state. You do not need her consent to record. You can be fired for it though. What do you think this recording can do to help you? Sure. She can also fire you
