 In December I got finessed by two salesmen at my school and signed up for a month at a gym for $1. I asked if it was going to charge me automatically when the month ended and they told me not if I called and confirmed I did not want to carry it over into the next month. Before the month ended I called and the woman at the desk said I was not in the system for the membership to be carried over and i should be fine. I woke up this morning to a $100 charge. When I called their customer service line I was told that I was signed up for a year long membership, each month being $100, and it would cost $300 to cancel. What are my options?  Do you have a copy of the contract you signed? If not, ask the gym for a copy - and you want to see the one with your signature on it. You can also try having your credit card stop payment.  Then I won't belittle you because you can't spell gullible I’m belittling them for blaming it on the salesman. It’s chain of negativity. Dont belittle someone because they are gullable.  I like how you act like it was the salesman’s fault for you not reading the contract. Your options are to carefully read over the contract that you signed to see what it says and in the future to not be so easily distracted by someone flirting with you.  This You sign a contract?
