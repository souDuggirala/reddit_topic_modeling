 Would the child be a US citizen because I am? Should it be born in Russia? Should I try to get her a visa before it's born? Should I marry her as fast as I can and try to begin the process for a spouse visa? I would like her to have citizenship as quickly as possible. She has a degree in Chinese and english as well.
