 I see so many videos from the front door/porch of package thief stealing mail. Most of the stories end with them getting away because all you have is some random face. I have wondered why people don't install cameras on the mailbox to capture the tag of the getaway car that is often part of this scenario. Someone told me that that was illegal since you were recording off your personal property. Is this true?  No, not in all jurisdictions. In most places, as far as I'm aware, it's perfectly legal to install cameras that face the street as long as it's on your own property. The main problems aren't legal, they're technical. You have to get a decent camera to resolve license plates, and they have to be placed and angled just right, and then you have to figure out how to power them, connect to them, and keep the camera itself from being stolen.
