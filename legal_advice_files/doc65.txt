 Title pretty much sums it up. While i was at work the other day, they came by, took all 4 of my outdoor kittens to the humane society and had them put down. I want to know what i can do legally about this as i feel they have trespassed on my property, stole my property, and destroyed my property, all without my consent. Feel free to ask details or PM me about the situation. Side note sorry for formating and errors, i am on mobile.
