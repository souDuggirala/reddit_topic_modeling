 I can't even believe this is happening I'm crying my Fucking eyes out right now. I'm a 21 year old engineering student and have stayed away from drugs all my life... Literally never touched anything and don't even know what they look like. I bought a used car the other day from a used car dealer, and on the way home from buying it was pulled over for a broken licence plate light. THE CAR NEVER EVEN MADE IT HOME. Police asked to search the car, which I was 100% okay with since I've never done anything and had no idea anything was in the car. The police found a bad of weed under the seat and arrested me. I had to get my parents to pay my bail. I'm Fucking crying right now because my future is destroyed over something I didn't even know was there. I've ALWAYS stayed away from drugs for this reason so I would have a future and now because of this I'm going to live in a Fucking trailer park for the rest of my life with a criminal record. What do I do? I'm pretty much fucked no matter what is what I'm getting out of this. I can't believe this is happening... Not if the dog is too far away. Rodriguez v. U.S.. Theyâ€™ll just keep you there until they can get a dog to sniff it out so they can get probable cause He already said he did...  Why did the police search the car ? Did you give them permission ?  Calm down. We have due process. Contact a criminal defense attorney immediately. There are ways of introducing sufficient doubt that those were your drugs. For example, a drug test showing no recent drug use. Moral of the story is never consent to officers searching your vehicle even when youre innocent. Chill out. Hire a decent lawyer, and all this will cost you is a little money.
