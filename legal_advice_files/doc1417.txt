 I'm a screenwriter and director and created a script for a very innovative sci fi film. I wanted to raise money for the piece, and my author friend offered to turn it into a novel. He just finished it and it's amazing, but before I pitch it to a publisher, I want to get a contract between us so we both get something out of it, from money to rights. I'm just not sure what is fair it what a contract like this would even look like. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you ahead of time.  Document drafting is beyond the scope of this sub. See an attorney.
