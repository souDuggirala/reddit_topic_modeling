 Essentially the title, but would I as a former student of Colorado Technical University (which is a school of the Career Education Corporation) have a solid case for having my loan be forgiven as CEC essentially admitted to defrauding students in their settlement of the lawsuit announced Jan 3, 2019? How would I go about applying to this program to have my federal loans forgiven? Each month I hate that woman more and more. I can't stand her backing MLMs and her ruining education is another nightmare.
