 I parked my minivan at a friend's apartment complex while away on a 4-day trip. My friend registered the minivan with the apartment folks (in fact, he did so several months ago, since I've done this before.) I came back and found the van missing, presumably towed (my friend is still trying to get in touch with the apartment folks). We'll try to talk things out of course, but if they refuse to admit fault and/or pay the tow place, what should I do next? Foot the bill and sue them in small claims? Location: CA, USA I'm guessing the apartment complex didn't let the towing company know your car was authorized then No tag, but we gave them a description and license plate as part of registering. Yeah, we realized that might be it, which would suck. They have no way of distinguishing though... Are you sure your friend's lease allows him to register cars belonging to non-occupants? That would be against the rules in most places. This could be a case where you just got lucky earlier and got caught this time. "Foot the bill and sue them in small claims?" Yes. Mitigate damages by paying to get the car out of car jail. Then go after whoever screwed up. Did the apartment give you some kind of tag to put in the windshield saying you were ok to park there?
