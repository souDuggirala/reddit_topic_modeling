 Today I was browsing Reddit. And I looked in my messages and got this. I have done nothing against the law, and yet these people are trying to get my information. Yeah, I troll sometimes and I have different opinions on subjects but I’ve never once broken the law here. What do I do? Should I tell my parents. Talk to your parents. Removing because you are about to get a shitstorm of nasty comments here. Stop trolling.  Get out.  But that's a lie, in one of your comments you said you were glad women were going to die, and it wasn't on a thread about women being sick with BC or anything like that. You also make claims that basically admit to sexual harrassment and assault. Your comment history is rife with reasons to concern law enforcement, and I'd be stunned if you didn't at some point cross the line into harrassing an individual. Try one of the options in this link if you don't get any response from the PM: reddit.com/contact/ Edit: you said this; . These SJWs are causing society to crumble before our very eyes. Fucking founders of this nations success being dethroned by women who are at they are not on the top. Atleast I know that these SJW fucks will die from their own doing I’m not threatening any specific person. The most I’ve done is say I like anime lolis, but that’s not against the law. How do I contact Reddit they said to contact them for the law enforcement agencys information but they have not responded. I sent replied to that message asking for their info to file an objection and they are ignoring me. Ok I fixed it It honestly looks as though you took your trolling too far. You're calling for the death of women and making some other semi specific threats. That's the best guess I can make unless you've been infringing on copyright or doing other nonsense in PMs somehow.
