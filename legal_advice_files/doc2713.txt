 I was pulled over on the highway for speeding. Thankfully, the officer only given a warning. However, when he asked for my registration, I had to dig through my glove box to find it. I was given maybe 90 seconds before he left with my license saying he’d be right back. By the time he got back, I had found and presented him with my registration. However, I was still issued a ticket for failure to display registration. The fine is only $50 and I would gladly pay it without going to court, but I also don’t want any points on my license. Does this offense put points on my record and is it worth going to court to argue? Thanks.
