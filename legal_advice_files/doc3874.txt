 You might want to add to your post why your insurance was cancelled and if you were still paying for it. Do you have any contact info for the woman? It's illegal for her to leave the scene of the accident without exchanging info, even if she wasn't at fault. (And I'm not sure how you know she wasn't at fault when you don't know what happened and you never even saw the other car.) Your best bet given what you knew at the time would have been to contact the police immediately to report a hit-and-run. She was probably driving without a license or insurance if she was in such a hurry to leave. Of course, now this is a more delicate situation because you were driving without insurance and you could face fines or a suspension of your license if this is discovered. IANAL so I won't tell you if it's in your best interests to go to the police now.
