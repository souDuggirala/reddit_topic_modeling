 Hello everyone! I currently live in Southern Maryland and the current temperature is 96F. Our apartment is sitting at 83F. It has been VERY hot the entire week, even reaching past 90F. Our apartment AC has not worked for 5 days now and I can't take it anymore. I have called the leasing office, I have called and emailed maintenance, I have put in multiple maintenance tickets which have all been deleted. We have bought fans which have failed to cool our apartment down, and we are not allowed to have window unit ACs. I keep calling but I keep getting told that they will "get to it". I have MS which has been made so much worse due to the heat so my husband is considering staying at a hotel until it is fixed. We also have a child that has CF and I am very worried for him and I have mentioned this to the leasing office. Question is, can we take the hotel stay out of our rent? TIA!
