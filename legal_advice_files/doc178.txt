 We don’t actually have cameras, but I already 100% knew who it was. So I texted them “really you set off firecrackers in my mailbox”. We have “under surveillance no trespassing” signs, but there is actually no surveillance. Anyways they admitted to it completely basically. If my family decides to contact law enforcement what would the charges be? We don’t wanna ruin their lives but this is seriously fucked Just call the cops what happens to hem is their own fault. They started apologizing begging me not to call the cops. I’m not sure if I really wanna get police involved How did they basically admit to it? You can take your evidence to the police.
