No idea If this is the right tag, but it seems the most fitting. 

I am in Ontario, Canada.

I signed a contract for a gym, terms were 1 year before canceling is accepted. 2 years later, I figured I would cancel my membership since work supplies me with a free gym. I made a call in September, 2017 to cancel my membership and was told that my membership would be cancelled, and I would see one last final charge on my card. 

Fast forward to May, 2018, i was still being charged however didnt really bother to deal with it. I Was going to be away for work( I am military and would be away for 6 months) so on may 8th, 2018, I called and attempted to cancel again. 
I had emailed as well as called many times to leave messages. On te 20th of May my call finally got through to someone, I was ensured that it would be cancelled.

The following months, I was still being charged, however did not have access to my phone due to work. 

On October 14th I had called and emailed to follow up and figure out why my situation is not being sorted out. Many emails, and voicemails, none being returned. 

I made a post about this a while back and got the advice to call my bank and seize payments as well as refund previous ones up to 3 months.
I did this and they refunded me 45$ each month for 3 months. Totaling roughly 150$

A few days ago I received an email stating that a 400$ claim has been sent to collections from my gym. I dont know if this matters at all, but my gym is part of a franchise, so is owned and operated by a franchisee.

I am tired of fighting this and trying to figure this out. This has added unneeded stress, and will start to affect my career if I proceed to take this to course. I will not be allowed to have any form of career progression until this is sorted out, if in court.

Before I proceed to meet with a local lawyer, I figured I would see what people on here think. I do not want to waste a lawyers time if I have no ground for any action here.
