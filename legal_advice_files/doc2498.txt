 On Wednesday at 1:30pm I attempted to deposit my payroll check on my banking institution's app. I received an error message that caused me to believe that the deposit attempt had failed. Rather than trying again, I decided to just cash it at the store. I just accessed my online account to find out that the check cleared...but I already cashed it. Here is the email I just sent out to corporate: Hello. I am reaching out to inform the banking staff that I had cashed my payroll check ($430) under the belief that my initial attempt to deposit the check online had failed due to technical issues. However, I just recently noticed upon accessing my account that the initial deposit actually cleared. The value of the check was added to my account, but I have already cashed that same check. Sorry for any inconvenience. Am I in trouble?  The bank gives you credit while a deposit is processing, but it actually takes a few days. In this case, it won't actually clear (assuming the place you cashed it got there first). They'll reclaim the money and probably charge you a returned-item fee as well. "Corporate" likely has nothing to do with it.  Nope. The bank will just take the money out of your account, so don't spend it.
