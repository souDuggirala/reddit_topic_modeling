 Can we do anything or do we have to pay. My bill is almost a thousand dollars. The town just got gas 2 years ago so nobody knew what to expect in the price. They say they have under charged since we got it. Most states have a Public Service Commission or some similar authority who oversees electricity, water, gas, etc. rates and is the public advocate against problems like this. You can file a complaint with them so they will investigate. Most of the time, they have quite a bit of power to regulate these companies. Obviously, we need your location for more specific advice. Location? To be clear, was the rate they charged at wrong or was there some other calculation error or other factor involved? If you signed up at X cents per whatever units gas comes in (I forget), then I can hardly see how they have a case. But if they told you the rate that equals this new total and somehow just calculated the bills wrong, I can see how you’d likely have to pay. Of course without knowing your state this is all just guessing.  Look up your state (you don’t put one) but many states require you be given as much time to pay the bill as it took for the company to notice the error and bill you. So if it’s a 2 year error than you get 2 years to pay. You can probably double check with your states utility commission. Ianal but I did have this problem and this is how I fixed it. Sounds like they set a price and realized they need to make more money. See your town attorney. This sounds like something the town need to do together.  Not a Lawyer. Local is not optional - the laws about how utilities can charge vary a lot by state. With a bill that size, you may want to see if you can get a Consult with a Civil Litigation Lawyer - they should be able to dig into the appropriate laws and statues better than Reddit, and may consult for small fee ($150) or even free.
