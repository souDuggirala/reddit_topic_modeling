I would like to file a small claim to collect C$26K from ex boyfriend.

I lent him C$40K to start his own business and was paid back C$25K after 4 months. And I lent again C$15K to pay for unexpected expense for the company. The balance of his owing is about C$26K as of today.

All I want is to set a payment schedule and be able to seize his account when he neglects payment. 

I've been keeping his book since his company started. The money I lent him is all accounted in it. If it's possible I would like to claim my missed wages since I've been working for him for free.

I would like someone to educate me on small claim procedure. Thank you. Thank you. Probably I'm misunderstanding the role of lawyer. This whole thing is very informative. A lawyer doesn't enforce a judgement.  The courts do. This is a great information to intake! Thank you!

One thing, do I have to be accompanied by a lawyer to enforce the judgement? [This should lay out how to get your started.](https://sasklawcourts.ca/index.php/home/provincial-court/small-claims-court)
