 Happened in southern california. I was in a right-only turning lane, and the guy in front decided he was in the wrong lane, and wanted to get over on the left. However, they was a car to the left side of him so he couldn't just pull in, so he decides to reverse and backs right into me (obviously without looking behind first), and drives off. The first thing I did was memorize and write down his license plate #, and when I searched it up online later the results did confirm to be the same car. Then I pulled over, called 911, police came, created a report, I got the report #. The damage was very minor: Left side of my front bumper came loose so it is just sticking out a bit. He didn't back into me very hard - I believe there is no further damage beyond the front bumper. When I asked the policeman what to do next, he said it may or may not be worth pursuing because: 1) It is unclear who exactly was the driver 2) the car may not even belong to the driver at the time or the driver is uninsured 3) if you report to insurance, you will still pay out-of-pocket deductible and insurance may go up I am writing this right after I got the police report #. I haven't yet called my insurance. Even though I potentially have the correct vehicle's license #, is this worth pursuing (filing insurance claim, etc)?  They said they can't do much about it, esp. because they don't know who exactly the driver is and the driver could be uninsured. It's up to the insurance and/or DMV to determine what happens.  I've never had my insurance go up due to not-at-fault accidents. Even if insurance/the police can't prove the driver of the other car, insurance still will cover your damages. Damage to bumpers can be deceptively expensive. My opinion is that you should report it. For a small bit of damage I personally wouldn’t go through that hassle. Are the police not pursuing this because someone committed a crime though? Seems odd they’d just write off a hit and run so easily.
