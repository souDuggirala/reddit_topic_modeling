 What are our rights as consumers (if any)when we purchase something with guaranteed delivery and it is not delivered by that guaranteed date? I’ve been burned too many times (as I’m sure many others have) purchasing something from a vendor based on that guaranteed date that I otherwise would not have purchased. I’ve followed up with companies and gotten a couple bucks back but most often I get the answer of tough luck. It seems like this practice of guaranteeing delivery to get people to purchase and not following through is becoming common practice.  You're legally entitled to recover all of the damages you've suffered as a result of the vendor fucking up unless the contract says otherwise. You can sue the shit out of them in federal civil court if you want, or small claims court if they operate in your state. However, your actual damages are most likely just the costs of shipping and handling or possibly a refund of the item itself, and the contract most likely explicitly limits damages to the aforementioned. Small claims court costs more than $10 to file in, so you're probably not going to be able to actually get your money back. If you're the type of person who enjoys spending time and money to fuck around with a large corporation, you should file in small claims court anyways and extract your pound of flesh by any means necessary. edit: You should also check the contract to see whether it includes an arbitration clause. If it does, it'll be even easier since you can often do the process by mail! Depends on what the terms of your purchase agreement say. They will typically define what they mean by guaranteed and will explain the compensation or remedies you have for a late delivery. Typically you would just be entitled to cancel the sale and get your money back.  This would likely depend on the company's policies surrounding what you're entitled to when you choose their "guaranteed delivery" service/option.
