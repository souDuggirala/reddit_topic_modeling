 This isn’t extremely urgent but I’m looking for information. I received a speeding ticket in Ohio in June 2018. I had a New Jersey drivers license. Admittedly I paid the ticket extremely late (Jan 2019) and the township in Ohio sent me a receipt confirmation and a copy of my “release” that they will send to the NJ DMV as well to let them know it’s paid and my license should not be suspended. The original letter said it needs to be paid by Jan 22 to avoid suspension and I paid Jan 13. I received a letter in the mail dated Feb 9 2019 saying it’s suspended and I need to pay $100 to re instead. I have the receipt and original letter from the NJ dmv so if I show them this should I be able to get that fee waived? Or am I screwed and have to pay the fee? I know I can call them, but they are closed today and I’ll be at work tomorrow so I won’t be able to reach out till Monday so I wanted to get advice here.  If you’re a resident in Ohio, I’m assuming Ohio expects that you will have an Ohio license and registration within a certain amount of days from establishing residency. You’ll have to fix this in New Jersey. I don’t think a phone call is going to do that, but it’s worth a shot. Worst case, you end up going back to New Jersey in person to fix this. You have to pay New Jersey a reinstatement fee to get your license back. Every state charges them after a suspension.  So I actually live In Ohio for college and won’t be in NJ till after the semester (May). I also don’t drive currently so it’s not an issue really that it’s suspended but I’d prefer to not leave it suspended longer than it needs to be. Any chance you’d think I could do this over the phone and have Ohio send them a new release for me? Or is this a situation that would need to be done in person?  Sounds like the mail crossed paths here. If you can, go down to the DMV office in person and show the clerk the receipts and letter from Ohio.
