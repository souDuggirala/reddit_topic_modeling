 Someone I know (17 years old) admitted on an Instagram account that they drove drunk on the highway. Another person I know told me they wanted to show it to the authorities. Would this be considered an actual confession via an instagram post? I’m mostly just curious. I feel as if I should do something but I don’t want to get involved.  I damn well hope so drink driving is unforgivable and should have higher penalties you should tell this "friend" to be ashamed of themselves.... It is unlikely the police would be terribly interested. However, his school can and probably will fuck his day up for that. Nah prolly not It's evidence. Is it enough to bring charges? I don't know. A mere recorded admission probably isn't.
