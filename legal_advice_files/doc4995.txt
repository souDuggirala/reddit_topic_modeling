 My spouse went to get a loan and used me as a reference, he gave me a phone number to call and I was asked the following questions:. My name. If I'm over 18. My relationship with my spouse. How long have I known him for. The state I live in. The city he lives in. Whether I recommend him to be approved for a loan (I said yes). Whether I want to take a loan (I said no). Whether I want to receive information about promotions (I said no). Am I legally bound to anything? California is a community property state. It might be easier for banks to guarantee repayment if both partners sign contracts however it is still within their right under the law to pursue both partners over debt incurred by one.  No, until you sign a binding contract for said loan, you're not legally obligated to it.  If it’s your spouse than yes. Your debts are shared. It wouldn’t matter whether you’re a reference or not.  You don’t have to answer those questions. Your husband may not get a loan due to your refusal (or answers).
