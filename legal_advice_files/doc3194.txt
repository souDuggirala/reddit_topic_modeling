 I received a text message about an order from a store I've never heard of. When I click on the link for the order, it has my phone number but it was paid for using an Amex card which I don't have. I just checked my credit reports and there isn't anything in them about an active Amex card; there was a listing for a closed AMEX/DSNB account that was closed in 2015 which would make sense since I had a Macy's card around then. Also, I've had my phone number for around 10 years now, but I do remember at one point constantly getting phone calls from one specific number looking for the same person. I had assumed at that time that the person that they were looking for had given them the wrong number. Should I assume the same thing happened now? Or should I be worried about identity theft even if nothing appears strange on my credit reports? It’s definitely better to be safe than sorry. A lot of people just don’t pay enough attention when entering information online.  Thanks. That was my thinking especially after my earlier experience with my phone number. I just wanted to make sure and cover all my bases. I have E-mailed the store explaining the situation and asked them to remove my number.  If it’s just your phone number linked to the order and not any card info, it was most likely a simple mistake. I used to work in inventory and we saw this mistake happen all the time.
