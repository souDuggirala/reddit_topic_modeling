 The previous owner of my house committed suicide in 2012. I bought this house in early 2013. I was completely made aware of the situation before I bought the house. If I decide to sell, will not disclosing the fact of the previous suicide lead to any legal problems? Maybe she sold 3 years or more later; California has a 3-year limit. it was a difficult time, i didnt press her for details, maybe she told them, maybe not, but it wasnt an issue when she sold the house is the info i got. Your mother either didn't know or just hoped no one would find out. If she had actually spoke to either party as you suggested they would have informed her of the law and her obligations. like i said, my mom sold her house, i had nothing to do with it, as far as i know, it wasnt an issue, but i could be wrong Law enforcement doesn't give advice on selling homes. Any attorney worth their salt would be aware of [section 1710.2](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=1710.2. lawCode=CIV) of the Civil Code. she followed the advice of her attorney and law enforcement, i am under the impression it wasnt an issue, but i could be wrong. This is incorrect. California law requires seller to disclose any deaths in the home within the last three years of sale. If your mother sold within that timeframe and did not disclose, not only did she break the law but the buyer could have sued her if they found out. Thank you! Thank you! I don't want to take the loss that the other seller took when selling this house.  Appears no you don't need to by law. [Here](=64.06.020) is what is required to be disclosed when selling. my mom sold her house after her husband commited suicide, there is no legal reason to disclose the fact, this in in california. West Virginia does not require any disclosure of a death in the home.
