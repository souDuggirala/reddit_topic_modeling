 Location: Edmonton, AB, CAN So I have been with my current employer about 5 months now. On boxing day 2018 I was supposed to get benifits. However, I have yet to receive them. Extra info: My offer letter and HR both say that I am supposed to have them. After communicating with HR we found out that it is the benifit provider(sun life) that is not cooperating. This coming Friday HR I are sitting down to call sun life togeather. Are there any laws, policies etx that I can bring up to sun life to make them get my benifits set up?
