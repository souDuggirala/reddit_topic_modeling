      My parents are divorced with split legal custody but one parent has full physical custody. The custody agreement says nothing about travel or passports but I need a new passport to travel domestically and then internationally in 2019. One of my parents is threatening to not sign the papers to get the passport unless I travel against my will with her to China for an extended period of time. I am NOT willing to do this and I am wondering is there any way I can get a legal international travel document without both parents signing.

       The parent that has my physical custody has shared legal custody, does this mean they can get me a passport?

Both parents are needed to get a passport.  And, both parents will need to give consent for you to travel outside the country.  The consent for you to get a passport, and for you to travel outside the country is between your parents.  You have no say in the matter.

If your parents cannot come to an agreement, one of them may petition the courts for a modification or clarification, or follow mediation, depending on the terms of the custody orders or court rules.
