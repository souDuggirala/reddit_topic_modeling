 Dad is okay, which I’m extremely thankful for. His heating went out 2 days ago. Management had maintenance fix it this evening and the apartment caught fire about 3 hours later. Fire Marshall said it originated from the heater above the guest bathroom which is fishy considering they just worked on it. His apartment is completely totaled. Walls and ceilings were axed and destroyed and flooded from the fire department. He only lost about 10% of his belongings but He will without a doubt have to permanently relocate to a different unit or move to a new apartment complex all together. Anyone that has ever moved knows that it is more than a “weekend project.” Especially sorting through what is ruined and salvageable. Even his belongings that weren’t destroyed are somewhat ruined because literally everything reeks of smoke and burned chemicals. My dad makes close to poverty wages and I feel terrible for him because he really can’t afford to take time off of work to move. He is 65 and this will be a massive project for him. He does have renters insurance. Is the apartment complex liable for anything? I know that renters insurance will cover lost material items but what about time missed from work during moving, or all of the stuff that is ruined because of the smell? I just want to make sure he won’t be taken advantage. Any advice on things to be aware of or actions to take would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. :( The apt complex is not liable for anything except returning his unused rent for the current month, and agreeing to void his lease since his place will be out of commission for a while. His renters insurance should cover a temporary place to stay, and potentially moving expenses, though that depends on policy. However, does the apt management have other units nearby? Your dad may have an easier time of it if it’s just moving somewhere close.
