 Sorry for the typos. I removed his spyware rom my phone but idk it might still be on my comp. So basically last week my mom got a call from my friend's mom saying i was a bad influence telling me to never contact her daughter again. But i told my friend about this and she called bs, later I went to her place and her mother left a child in our care and acted... Not at all rude to mw letting me eat their food and watch tv. Are their services where you can buy a call???  Do you have an actual legal question? You said your father(or someone else) called your mother, not texted her. If both your parents are abusing you, why would your father(or someone else) call your mother pretending to be your friendâ€™s mother? I dont know That is exceptionally flimsy evidence. This is not a legal problem. It is, at best, a family dispute. No crime was committed here.  Something about all of this does not add up... Ya No i mean he paid someone to do it or got his friend to.  Hes the only one who has acess to my textss and must be behind it  I did not see where you found out this was your father. Why do you say as much? It is almost certainly not true.  Your mom doesn't recognize the voice of your dad? Most people can recognize gender over the phone pretty reliably even if they don't know eachother.  Both your parents are abusing you? He doesn't want me to be friends with her because he thinks my trauma induced memtal illness from him and my moms abuse is actually just "bad influences" Why did he impersonate your friend's mom? Yeah So your dad impersonated your friend's mom, and called your mom? No not imperaonating me impersonating her mom What is the purpose of your dad impersonating you?
