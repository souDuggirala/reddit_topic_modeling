 I got sick last year. I was bedbound for 9 months. I loaned my boyfriend $25,000 to invest in a business endeavor over the course of a few years. He promised verbally to pay me back. We were together 10 years. When I became sick he wanted nothing to do with me. I wrote the last check August 2017. After he left me recently... he said he owed me nothing since I got sick and he had to care for me. How do I get my money back? Any of it? If I sued him do I have a case? My statements show I took out the money. They were checks. I’m sure his bank shows the deposits. I’m so angry he left me after all these years because of a serious illness. I want my money back. The whole thing enrages me. [removed] A few questions--What were the terms of the loan? (How much was the interest, when was he supposed to pay you back by?) Did he make any payments to you? Google statue of frauds, seems like you’re sol  This amount of money is well beyond small claims territory. I think you should consult a lawyer if you think you can prove this to be a loan and not an investment.   Welp, there's your problem.
