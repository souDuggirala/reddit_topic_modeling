 I dont think there is a right to be forgotten outside the EU You could ask them to remove or change the name of the author, maybe come up with a pseudonym for them to use.  I certainly don't \expect\ to have any legal recourse. Was just hoping someone may have some advice on any chance I may have to get them removed, however slim. I was young and stupid and definitely regret freely providing them! They are quite an embarrassment for me now. Why would you expect a legal recourse here? You freely provided the articles... without prior agreement you can't retract them just because you don't want them out in the world anymore. Change your name maybe? Chances are, there's not much you can do about it.  I was hoping that wouldn't be the answer :(  Your next move should be to contact an SEO firm to bury the results if people do a search for your name. You likely have no grounds to have the articles removed. No.
