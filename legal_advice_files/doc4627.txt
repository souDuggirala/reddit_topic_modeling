 Ex wife set a hearing to adjust custody agreements. We divorced in 2016 and i have custodial rights. We are from Illinois and she moved 5 mins away from where i stay with our children. Now since she set the custody hearing shes been blowing money on the kids. I suspect that she is planing to try to beat me with receipts in court. She wants custodial rights from me now. Stating shes in a better place financially so she should have them. The parenting plan was open with her able to have them on weekends or when shes off work. If theres no drugs or abuse and the kids are A and B students could she win simply waiving money around? Its a custody hearing so what should i expect and could any permanent changes come from the hearing? The courts do not make custody decisions based on how much money a earns, much less on how much money a person spends. They certainly do determine child support based on income, though. But \[not\], based on spending money on the kids. It's possible that she is spending the money on the kids in an attempt to convince THEM that they are better off living with her. Depending on age and jurisdiction, the courts do take into account the desire of the children. But, the courts are also prone to maintain the status quo, so as to minimize disruption in the children's lives. An attorney would be better able to give you more specific advice, and help you properly prepare your case.
