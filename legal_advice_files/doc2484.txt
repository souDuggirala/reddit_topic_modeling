 Also, if they identify themselves while knocking, do you have to respond/answer thru door?  No. You don't have to respond. You don't have to open the door. You don't have to call them back. But if they, in fact, have a warrant, you can expect some damage to the door when they open it to act on the warrant. [removed]
