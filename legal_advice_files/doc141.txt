 I am currently a law student, interning this summer, and had a question about disclosing information regarding the work I am currently doing. I want to speak about my experience researching and writing memorandum on my resume and to be able to speak about it in interviews. I have read the ABA guidelines, Rule 1.6, and I'm not entirely certain to what extent I can discuss the litigation I am assisting with. Presently litigation had begun, complaints filed, counterclaims made, expert disclosure, etc... I would obviously not state the clients name, but may I speak about the specific laws I am researching? The laws that I am researching would disclose the client's type of business and I am working for a small firm so someone may be able to determine who the client is from this I suppose. I'm just fearful of disclosing too much information, to what extent may I speak about my experience? Okay great thank you, that makes sense! I don't think it's in your interest to talk about that level of specificity anyway. Say you researched environmental laws pertaining to pesticides and related regulatory and civil liability. Just to make sure I'm clear, say the laws I researched had to do specifically with landscapers, could I state I did research on a individual law concerning landscapers' use of pesticides and state action which can be taken against them? You can speak about it in general terms (you wouldn't want to be too specific on your resume anyway). In interviews you can talk about it in terms of the law without attaching it to any specific client.
