 Okay, uh, I never thought I’d have to make a post like this but it’s happening, I guess. So, I’m 19 years old (20 this year), I immigrated to the U.S. when I was 14, and my dad applied for Political Asylum, and it’s still in the process. I have a 16 year old brother, who moved here at the same time as us. We currently live with my dad, but my mom is also living here in California, and when we moved my parents were married but are now divorced. Sorry for the info dump, not sure if it’s relevant. Anyways- my dad wants to leave the U.S. (not back to our native country), and the rest of my family and I don’t, but we are under his application for P.A. Basically, I just came here to ask... How fcked are we if he does decide to leave? And is there anything I could do? Thanks in advance.  Try contacting an [immigration law services](=CA) organization for advice if you don't hear anything else from this sub. Best of luck.
