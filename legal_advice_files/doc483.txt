 I notified my landlord by phone call last Friday that I had a mouse problem, after just having moved in and finding mouse droppings throughout the kitchen cabinets and behind appliances during the cleaning. He told me he could get someone out Monday to look at it. He co-owns a pest control company, and has partners who also own 60 rental properties. This request should have been easy enough. On Monday, I sent a text asking him to let me know when someone would be by because my dog was loose in the house, but I work five minutes away and could go home to put him up AND because I had found a nest in the motor of my fridge and wanted to show some possible entry points inside the kitchen. He responded that he would "check his schedule and get back to me". As of today, four days later, not a peep, except from the little mousey squeaks in my kitchen. I texted again today asking if someone was still coming by, and there has been no response. Is text considered "in writing", especially since he responded? Looking at the codes, it still seems as that 14 days doesn't really mean much in terms of anything happening - I still have to fulfill my end of the lease, and can't withhold any rental money (which is fine). I just want to know if I need to take a letter up to his office. If he would have told me they would be by some other time (for example this Friday instead of Monday), or responded to my text when he said he would, or respond now it would be different. I didn't ASK for Monday, he offered that up. Then failed. I'm just asking for a response.   “in writing” Here, 4 days in, you might consider sending him a letter to eliminate the argument. Though you may overestimate the pace at which pest control, even partially owned, may respond.
