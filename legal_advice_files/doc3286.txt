 I'm going to try to make this as short as possible. We live in PA in a townhouse development of about 100 units. We've been sold three times in the past year. Once around February, again in the summer, again in the fall. Leasing agency #2 came in and had us all sign new leases. All utilities (except electric and cable) were included in rent. Leasing agencies #3 and #4 never presented us with new leases. Now, we've received bills from a debt collection agency in FL for gas, water, and sewage. We never signed a lease taking responsibility for these, nor were we ever notified we'd be billed. What is our legal recourse? It's not about the money. It's the fact that they recently let us go three days without water and to have this on top of that pisses me off. It's not just me. Every unit being rented also received the same letter, for varying amounts.  After you determine who sent you to collections, I would also send a photocopy of the existing lease to agencies 3 and 4. If it is a 12 month lease, any subsequent agencies/owners are bound by the terms in that lease.  Contact the debt collector and ask where you can send a written dispute of the debt. They may tell you to contact the leasing agency.  We never signed another lease. The last lease we signed was in February with agency #2. The letter states it's a debt collector for creditor "Name of Property". It came with an itemized breakdown of the charges.  Are you still under the term of the original lease? Determine which leasing agency sent the bill for collections. Request a debt verification letter, which should itemize the debt. Dispute the debt in writing, based on the fact that your original lease controls, absent the existence of any subsequent leases signed by you.
