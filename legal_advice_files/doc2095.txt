 Not under lease or contract. She owns it and is under her name. Been living there for over 2 months. Own apartment key and parking visitor pass. Many witnesses to know my car has been here for months and months. I paid her rent money just last week through PayPal. Have proof of her request of "rent" via texts. What I want: My possessions back. Can I call the police upon this domestic issue to help me get my possessions returned? I have receipts and proof of said possessions.  Depending what your stat laws are, I believe that after a certain number of nights, you legally live there and are not to be denies access to your dwelling unless mandated by the court.  This is theft. Report it as theft and request that they escort you back to the apartment.  They'll probably just recommend that you take her to court. Either way, that's gonna be the fastest and most secure way of recovering your property, imo. Good luck.
