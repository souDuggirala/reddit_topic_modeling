 Is it legal for a restauraunt to charge me a higher price because I am going through a third party (ie. delivery service)? For example today, I placed an order through Uber Eats and when I got my food delivered, I checked the receipt of the restauraunt. They had effectively baked in a delivery fee into the price of the food. On top of this, there's a line item for a delivery fee which would be charged by Uber. So in effect, I am being a delivery fee by the restauraunt and then a delivery fee by Uber! In principle, I could have technically hired someone (ie. Uber) to go buy my food to go at the restauraunt's menu prices...it would be messed up for them to jack up the prices then. Cool by them if they want to charge higher prices then their menu, but it would be better if it was clear and itemized upfront. I get Uber takes a cut of the transaction between the restauraunt and them, but that's between them and I donâ€™t feel the restaurant has the right to charge me more as a result of their agreements. It is such a pain in the ass to have to cross reference the menu at the restaraunt and the prices in the delivery services to make sure I'm not being gouged. Attached receipts for reference. []() All of those delivery services add in an extra charge. They do that so they can actually make money or at least break even with the delivery service. Totally legal.  The restaurant isn't charging you. Door Dash is charging you, they're who you're doing business for.  Yes they can charge you higher prices for almost any reason. This certainly isn't an unlawful reason.  It's legal.
