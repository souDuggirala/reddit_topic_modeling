 Okay so this just happened like 10 min ago: I was driving along and somebody in front of me braked particularly hard, forcing me to do the same. The guy behind me was following pretty close and he got within a little bit of me. Didn’t think much of it as I didn’t feel a bump or anything. The guy proceeded to follow me very closely. Fast forward to a little bit later and the guy that got really close to me earlier passes around me and flips me off and yells a ton of obscenities at me, leading me to believe he may have hit me without my knowledge. My bumper has no damage where he may have hit me. Was I in the wrong for not stopping? What should I do if the police show up at my door? He’s pissed off because you braked hard. If he wanted to call the cops he would’ve done it, not follow you and tell you his mind.  Yeah, plus if he did hit you it was his fault. You don't have any damage and you didn't cut him off so not on you.  I think he believed that you hit the brakes super hard to deter him from tailgating you.
