 I was speeding in my girlfriends car and she got a ticket in the mail. I had her write on the affidavit that I was driving, and that the footage will show a male driving. According to the ticket, liability can only be transferred to me if I accept it. So if I don’t accept liability, and she didn’t speed, is it possible to avoid this ticket entriely? Do you not think the courts will ask her who was driving? Or do you think the courts won't ask about a stolen vehicle report if she tries to claim she doesn't know who was driving?
