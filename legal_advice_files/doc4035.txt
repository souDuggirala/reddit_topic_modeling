 So a month ago I bought a car from a small dealership. After roughly 150 miles the cars check engine light came on. I checked the fluids and it had little to no oil, so I took it to get an oil change. The oil change place told me that they couldn’t do the oil change due to a major coolant leak and oil leak. I contacted the dealership to see what they could do and they told me to go to his “friend” who fixes cars and it would be half the price of a regular shop. Is the dealership liable or were they entitled to tell me that the car has issues? The vast majority of used cars in the USA are sold as is. Unless you have a warranty witten into your purchase paperwork (your odds of having that are close to zero or you would haave mentioned it), you own the car with all its problems. The time to check for mechanical problems was before buying it - now it is the time to decide whether the car is worth fixing.
