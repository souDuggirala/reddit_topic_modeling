 I specifically denied this app the right to access my storage, yet it still downloaded ads onto my phone, permanently in my storage. The ads were under the name of "UnityAdsCache". I contacted Unity, and they basically sent me a link for the [monetisation TOS]() and said "this explains how we cache videos" but imo it says nothing about that. I've also sent an email to the game devs asking them why they download unity ads onto my phone, and they have yet to respond. I contacted Google, and they referred me to their Senior Advertisement Team or something, and they told me to report the app, which I did. My question is: Does accessing storage to download ads violate any consumer rights?  What consumer rights do you have in mind here? I can't think of any which would be applicable. In any case: "access your storage" is Android jargon for viewing the contents of an SD card or certain types of other external storage on your device. Denying this permission to an app or service does not prevent it from using standard Android functionality to store data on your device. No. You are using their free app and they are sending you ads. If you don't want to see the ads don't use their app. Very simple. No rights violated because you don't have a right to use their app.
