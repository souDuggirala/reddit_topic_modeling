 I was in a car accident while working. I was found not at fault the other driver who was in a tractor and trailer was at fault. I do have a lot of back and hip pain along with headaches. One lawyer I spoke to said it would be a workmen’s comp lawsuit with 3rd parties. My boss has done everything right he picked me up, made me get checked out, I’m on pretty strict work restrictions and he has been very accommodating. I don’t want to have anything go against my boss or his workmen’s comp insurance. The driver of the tractor ended up blocking a state highway and tried to back off of it into a construction site with no traffic control. The vehicle I was in is totaled. This is in NJ can I have a suit and not have it go against my boss’s ins.  you will probably have to file workers comp, have them pay out, then repay workers comp form any settlement you receive.
