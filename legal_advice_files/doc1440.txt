 Hey Reddit - Need some help I’ve recently moved to Idaho. Prior to this I rented a condo in Everett WA (snohomish county) for about 3 years from an individual who lives in Mexico. The address she listed on the last lease is in Everett WA. There was no walkthrough upon move out. She susequently called the Tuesday after I left telling me what terrible condition I let her property in. This isn’t the case whatsoever and based on previous conversations with her i realized she was gearing me up to keep my deposit so she could fix up the property to sell this spring. She didn’t abide by the law in mailing me a disclosure of fees withheld nor a refund or portion of a refund within the 21 days the state allows. I waited 30 days for any communication from her in case the mail bounced but confirmed many times that she had the correct address. When I did contact her she huffed and hawed but eventually she emailed gouging statements/bills and offered me about an 1/8th of the deposit. I’ve prepped to send her a payment demand letter but also called the clerk snohomish county who told me I need to sue her in the state she lives in. The clerk didn’t want to understand that the landlord lives in Mexico and that I live in Idaho. Am I not able to handle a small claims over the phone? How do I handle this if her address listed is in Everett Wa but she actually lives in Mexico?  If she lists her address as Everett, WA then she's subjecting herself to their jurisdiction. You should be able to file with the applicable court there.
