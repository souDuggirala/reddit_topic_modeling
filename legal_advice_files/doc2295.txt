 We got table service at a nightclub in Santa Monica, California. There were open flame candles on wall panels that separated the tables. I was standing near the table and my hair caught fire from one of the candles. I lost a good amount of hair but no major burns. I will have to cut my hair to align it with how much I lost and to cut off the burnt ends. Does anyone know what the open flame laws are that apply to bars/clubs? Would I have a legitimate claim to file a lawsuit?  To summarize, there is a legal doctrine called "Open and Obvious," which means that if the danger of the candles is clear to everyone, the onus is on you to avoid standing next to them. To answer her specific legal question, [No person shall use upon the stage, in the dressing room, or within the public area of any assemblage occupancy, any open flame, except by authority of a written Special Permit from the Chief. The permit shall be available for inspection at all times.]()  Yes but that was because the girl chose to remedy the situation with hair extensions instead of a haircut like OP wants. if the club were actually liable in this situation, which they don't appear to be, you would be wrong and hair can get expensive. see the other legal advice post from a month or so ago about the teen who "accidentally" cut a girls hair At most they will owe you $15 haircut from Great Clips.  You'd essentially be suing for a haircut.  California courts may be curious what your BAC was at the time of hair ignition. They may also want to know why you were willing to enter the club, seeing the candles, remain at the club, while seeing the candles, stand near the candles while you saw them burning, and then they might be curious what your explanation of events between you being fully aware of candles near you and your hair igniting would be.
