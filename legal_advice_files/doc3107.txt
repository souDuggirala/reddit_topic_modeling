 Hello all, just looking for some advice. In 2015 I had to get a credit card to cover some dental work. They gave me a $3,000 credit line. I used up most of but not all of the $3,000 and I am now being sued for the entire $3,000 plus interest. Life happened and I have been out of work since due to some medical issues. I received a few letters from lawyers last week stating my name had come up in the court docket and I was being sued. I have yet to receive anything from the courts. Due to the nature of my medical issues I do not work and have since started college to hopefully get into a line of work that is more realistic for me to do. I had to take a little extra money in student loans to buy a computer and a reliable car to transport back and forth to school. Can they take student loan money from my account to pay for the debt? What about my car? I still owe close to 10k on it but it's in mine and my mom's name as she makes the payments. Can they take the car? I'm mostly worried about losing the car or the loans needed for school. What are the next steps for me to take? Can they sue for the whole amount even though I didn't use the whole credit line? I never received money or anything it was just a credit line of $3,000 and I only used roughly $2,500. Thanks for the help.  Never made any payments and the court filing shows they are suing for the $3,000 plus interest bringing it to the $3800 they have filed for.  Did you ever make any payments? The penalties and interest could be over $3000 by now. Are you sure that isn't what's making the amount higher?
