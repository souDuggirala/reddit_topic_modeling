 So, with the advent of the many videos we see online of police demanding ID from people filming, I have a few questions regarding the true requirements for ID. The Ohio Revised Code2921.29 states( paraphrase/nutshell) that no one shall refuse to DISCLOSE their name, address, date of birth upon request of a LEO if they have committed, are about to committ, or are committing a crime or is a witness to a felony. 1. Do I HAVE to provide a physical ID document or does verbally stating my name suffice? 2. If I simply state my name ( which is difficult to spell) and the police ask for clarification, such as spelling, am I able to refuse to clairify once my name is stated? 3. Do I have to volunteer my address and birthdate or do police have to specifically ask for that info as well? 4. At what point do I even HAVE to disclose info to police? Obviously they can ask at any time, but what would be the line in the sand that would have to be crossed to make it legally required for me to ID and how would I know we have reached that point? You have no legal requirement to carry an ID unless you are operating a motor vehicle; even then, providing your license number is usually sufficient....people forget wallets or have them stolen all the time. And that is not the same as identifying yourself, and you can do that without an ID. LEGALLY the police have to observe you violating a law/ordinance in order to request that you identify yourself but let's be real....they dont exactly play by the rules. Best advice I can give is give them the information they ask for and inquire as to why they need it. Any specific reason why you're inquiring about the need to identify yourself?
