 So my disability was declined but im pretty sure im unable to work due to mental health conditions including panic disorder and depression. i feel hopeless as i have no income and idk what to do. im also dealing with gender transition and working hard to get out of bed or shower.  If you donâ€™t have a disability lawyer you need one. Almost everyone has to refuel over and over. Mental health is harder to get. So keep going to your doctors and therapists. If you haven had a neuropsych evaluation you need one.  Came here to say this. Many people get denied the first time out. Are you seeing a mental health professional? Do you have unemployment benefits you can draw on? Getting on disability for mental disorders is possible, but significantly harder than with physical impairments. If you can find some balance through therapy and medication that could let you earn a living, it would doubly benefit you. Are you seeing a Doctor whom is willing to state you are unable to work due to these conditions? Many times people will hire a disability attorney after the initial denial. As long as you have a doctor stating you are unable to work then an attorney would probably be your next step. If a disability attorney excepts your case they will work on a contingency basis to get a portion of your backpay instead of having to pay them upfront. ETA it can be a very, very, very long process.
