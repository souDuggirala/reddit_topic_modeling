 Iowa Had old cc debt from college (~$2000). Creditor sold the debt and the new creditor filed suit. I contacted their attorneys immediately and paid the debt (have a written agreement that the debt was be considered settled if I made the payment). I was served and did not respond assuming the case would be dismissed as agreed. I had called their attorney after making the payment and they ensured me that they have received the payment and would file for dismissal. 2 weeks later I receive a letter in the mail that a default judgment/guilty plea has been entered against me. What do I do now? I shall call them tomorrow and see what they say. Thank you so much! I understood that, they can file the motion to send aside or vacate the default judgement as a way to prevent you from incurring g legal fees which you could then attempt to recover as they caused the fees. I have not contacted them yet. (Sorry if I wasn’t clear but I did not hire lawyers when I settled the debt. They were the lawyers for the creditor). Have you contacted the lawyer's office where the deal was struck? They should be able to file a motion to set aside the judgement. Thanks! I’m trying to see if there’s a recourse without hiring a lawyer and spending a bomb.  Do that. The justification for this is new information that was not considered at your original trial, which is to say the settlement that you worked out outside of court. Yes! Does the judgment come with paperwork for an appeal?
