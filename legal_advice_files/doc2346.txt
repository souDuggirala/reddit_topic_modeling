 I’m in the process of doing a DIY divorce here in Las Vegas. DYI because (stbx)wife and I have been pretty amicable on what should go in there. Even though I do not want the divorce, I’m taking care of it. My question is even though I’m paying child support and alimony before a decree is even generated, can I add in the divorce paperwork for her to pay for her own mobile phone? Perhaps even to refinance her car so my name comes off and I’m no longer responsible for paying for it? I just found out tonight that she’s been seeing someone else and I don’t want to be paying for those things knowing she’s using them with/for him. We’ve been separated for several years, and only now been physically separated for a few months.  I guess I meant more about those things being resources for the kids. But those resources are the phone and car and I was (still am) worried about finding a balance between child-support/alimony and paying for those things myself. "Using these things for him" has no bearing on your divorce. However, if you're separated and are settling property amicably, her taking care of her own phone and sorting out the title on the car are totally reasonable on their own merits. These are issues that are typically sorted in a divorce.
