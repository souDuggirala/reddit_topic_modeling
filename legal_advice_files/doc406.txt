 Hello reddit! A few days ago i received a collections notice in regards to a red light ticket I had no idea I was issued. After calling the Seattle DOT, I watched the video and realized that it was in fact me...not completely stopping for a right hand turn. BUT, the ticket was sent to my former California address so I never received it because my old plates were on my car even though my temporary plates were in the rear window of the vehicle. Because of the ticket being sent to the wrong address, i now owe more than $150 in late fines. The collections agency says I can send proof of a mistake to them and they will send it to the courts for a decision as to whether the ticket can be wiped out. (Meanwhile interest is still accruing during the 30-45 day turn around) Advice I need!: Should I send in the picture of my car with the plate visible and plead my case regarding temporary registration? I'm not sure if; the courts can negate accrued interest, if having my CA plates still on my car nullifies the temporary, if the picture of the temp registration is enough. I don't want to argue the decision and accrue more interest if it is not even possible to win :( Timeline: Sep 2016 - move to Seattle sep 2016- get new license and temporary plate (taped inside rear windshield, CA plates still on car) feb 2017-red light camera (picture taken of CA plates, can see there is something taped to the inside or rear windshield) mar 2017- actual plates arrive and registration states it is valid beginning mar 2017 feb 2018- receive collections notice. If the video evidence they possess proves beyond a doubt that you are guilty of the crime that they ticketed for you then I would pay. If I were you though, i would not pay the full amount. I would negotiate with the collections agency to waive all the late fees/interest and just pay the original ticket amount.
