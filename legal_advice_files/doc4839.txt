 So I currently have an apartment in Austin. I just got a tentative job offer in San Antonio pending criminal background check. That's just paperwork at this point, and I'll get the full offer with date sometime soon. At that point I'll need to look for an apartment in San Antonio and break my lease in Austin. Is there anything I can do to keep from paying the remainder of the lease, since I dont have the money for that.  You can also attempt to find a new tenant yourself. I just looked at it, and it said I would have to pay a reletting fee, and I would be liable for the rent until they find a new tenant. So I can see me being on the hook for like 2 months or so. Really if it goes beyond that, it would be reasonable to assume that they aren't doing thier due diligence. I'll talk with the landlord once I get I have dates, and see what I can work out.  If your lease doesn’t have a termination clause that allows you to break it due to jobs, then all you can do is 1) ask about paying a lesser fee to break it or 2) try to sublet If you can’t do either upon surrounding your keys the landlord should make efforts to relet the property, and once they do you wouldn’t be on the hook for future rent, but you would be until that point.
