My mother passed away last month and lived in South Carolina.  My sister lives near her but we aren't on good terms and don't speak (her daughter texted a cousin which is how I know).  I know I was in the Will (but don't know for how much) and the executor was an attorney, but I don't know who he/she is.  Can anyone tell me the timeline the Attorney/Executor has for notifying those who are in the Will and the details?   No knowledge of South Carolina laws in this area specifically, but there typically is only a deadline by which things have to be filed, not a required timeline in terms of how quickly things have to be handled.

Do you know the County in which your mother lived until she passed? That’s the County in which the will would have to be filed in order to open the estate and begin the process of handling things. Call the clerk’s office in that county to determine how you can find out if the will’s been filed. That should also allow you to determine what lawyer is handling the estate.

If you’re a beneficiary, you should be able to get information directly from that lawyer. Note that this is typically not a quick process; the estate has to stay open for long enough for creditors to make claims, etc. Once you find the lawyer, they’ll be able to advise you as to expected timeframe.
