 My spouse and I live in Colorado and we have family in Texas. We made our own wine and would like to send some to our family as part of our Christmas gifts. 1. Is this legal? The only information I was able to locate was specifically for wineries and sales, but we have no intention of selling the wine. 2. If it's illegal, is there any way we can do it legally? (Licenses, permits, etc) ...... This is a legal advice subreddit and you are advocating breaking the law. Please stop. Just don’t tell the post office what it is. Way worse stuff gets shipped every day. The usps/fedex/ups are the biggest drug traffickers in the world. The odds that they’re gonna flag a bottle of wine are very low. Legally speaking though, probably not legal. But the package will most likely get there with no hassle Yes, it's one thing to receive wine in the mail, which varies by state. I believe Texas is a state where you can receive wine/beer in the mail. But I've also been told that you have to have a license to send wine through the mail, when trying to do the exact same thing as OP (not sure why i thought this would work). I'm not sure how one becomes licensed but I'm guessing it's expensive and takes a while.  Everywhere I was able to search online has indicated that it is prohibited for any individual to mail alcohol to another individual, whether it’s through UPS, FedEx, or USPS. It seems only licensed wineries can do so, so unless you want to get a retail winery license, it looks like you’re out of luck. [UPS]() [Fedex]() [USPS]() It appears the most practical way to send wine would be through purchasing from a licensed retailer, although I imagine that defeats the purpose of your gift.
