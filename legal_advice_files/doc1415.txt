  This is in CA So I contacted a company TWICE letting them know instantly the next day when they laid me off ( July 2018) about my change of address and about two weeks ago I contacted them again with the same address and this time email. What would happen if they failed to send me or email me my tax information. And what happens if they deliver it to the wrong address even after I have contacted them about it instantly. So far nothing has been sent or emailed,but it is still too early to tell. I have the date and time when I contacted them about it.  You don’t have to own the place, if it’s where you’re staying and get your mail sent there, you can change your address to it. Yea I don’t technically have a location since I don’t own the place. So idk how that works. Everything that gets delivered to me I just change the address on my apps, but tax info usually gets sent in the address I give the company.  I don’t have an answer regarding what happens— but I do have one suggestion: now that you’ve told the company about your address change, set up mail forwarding to your new address and change your address at the post office.
