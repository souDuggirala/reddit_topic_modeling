 I was a streamer on Twitch.tv last year and have earnings that I need to file with my taxes. They [tweeted]() this towards the end of January so I waited another week. On Feb 5th, I sent an email to Twitch support asking for more definite information regarding this but I still have not received a reply. AFAIK, they are supposed to have this to us by the end of January. If I have to wait until the end of February, that leaves six weeks to prepare and file my taxes. What am I supposed to do? I do have all of that information on hand. I was just under the impression that the 1099 form had to be filed along with everything else. Thank you.  Technically, you are supposed to have your own records as to what you made. What is reported on a 1099 is intended to be informational, not a straitjacket. You'll have it by the end of February.
