 Location : Canada, QC As the title says, I know of a will that isn't notarized but that I believe is legal (two witnesses and an affidavit by the personal doctor of the deceased person saying he was sound of mind when he wrote the will). The family denies the existence of a will. I know where that will was stored in the house, and it's impossible they didn't find it since they apparently found all the other papers. They say the only will he was ever written gave everything to his wife, but since she died some years before him, the will isn't valid anymore so everything will be split between his two brothers. I have a photocopy of the will. I'm also in contact with one of the witnesses and actively trying to find the second witness. Who do I contact with that information ? The liquidators (his nephews) are rushing to liquidate the succession and part of the estate has already disappeared. Yes, I am the sole beneficiary of the will they claim don't exist.  Its time for you to hire a lawyer to at the very least try to pause the liquidator's actions while the will issue is resolved.  In physical assets, less than $100K (house, truck, ATV, tools, etc.) and that's generous. The house is the most expensive, and they're evaluated at around $68K for city taxes. I doubt I could get more than $60K if I was to sell. As for insurance, investments, etc. I have no idea. The guy worked a farm hand/labourer/jack-of-all-trades all of his life. As far as I know, he lived off his government pension. I knew I was a beneficiary in the will, I was told I would get the woodworking tools, we were already planning to move them to my place in the spring. I had no idea I was the sole beneficiary.  How much money are we talking about here? Has this person died yet? If not, it doesn't matter. Wills aren't a matter of public record until some time after death.
