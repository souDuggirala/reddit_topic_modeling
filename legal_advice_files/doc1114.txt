 I'm a bit emotionally distraught at the moment, so hopefully this comes out clearly. Basically what the title says. Things have been rough between her and me for a while now, she is currently pregnant with our child. We got into a big argument about different ideas about raising children (we each have a child from a previous relationship that don't get along and are completely different). She demanded I leave, I refused saying I needed to find a new place to live first, she left to stay at her mom's house. She owns the house I am currently living in, she doesn't work and I've been paying all the bills with my job. I really don't want to leave her homeless, but at the same time I don't want to stay here if she really wants me to leave. Do I have to leave immediately? Or do I have options to stay and find a new place? Also she did say she would let me lease the house which I don't really understand anything about that. Any help would be appreciated. I live in Michigan. Get a lawyer. Quick. This has a lot of Family Law implications that may (depending on your jurisdiction) elevate this problem from a Landlord Tenant issue to a court with greater sympathy to your situation and may also provide remedies and protections not afforded to a lower court. Get independent legal advice in your jurisdiction.  You are probably a month to month tenant. She needs to give you a written 30-day notice to vacate.
