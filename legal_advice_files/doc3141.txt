 Hi all so a friend of mine (brother 1) is going through a divorce and wants to know what he needs to provide to the other parties lawyer regarding the money he owes to his brother (brother 2) but has no paperwork to prove it... it was basically a family loan based on trusting each other and a silent partnership between brothers when my friend (brother 1) purchased a rental property. The rental property title and mortgage is on on the brother 1 name and his STBexWife had signed a 'quit claim deed' at the time of purchase... I know it's a bit of an involved situation and dumb one too. The rental property does have a lot of equity now and the brother 2 wants his original money, plus profit share of equity and penalty . Brother 2 is not in the U.S Brother 1 is hopefully working with a divorce attorney, and should ask them. If not, brother 1 should consider getting an attorney.
