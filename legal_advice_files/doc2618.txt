 My stepdad was recently diagnosed with some form of blood cancer (I'm not sure what kind yet) after falling severely ill. I've never known him to have an especially healthy lifestyle, but he has always had a resilient constitution (he never gets sick). I know that this cancer could be a result of a variety of his behaviors such as dipping or drinking, but a blood cancer diagnosis seems strange to me (I would have guessed prostate or mouth). He has worked as a printer his whole life and my mom said that it could be related to the chemicals they use, but my first guess was Round-Up because he has always used it for lawn care (he is an avid landscaper). Should we report this to someone? I've heard that there have been some lawsuits going on involving Round-Up and it's relation to cancers of this kind. Should we do anything other than seek treatment?  You're going to need a very large firm that has very deep pockets. Your stepdad's case will be close to a test case. There is a lot of risk in this sort of case and you're looking at an easy 6 figures in expert fees. Causation is very difficult to prove in these sorts of cases. What I'm trying to say is make sure you get a firm that can front all of these costs and will have the treasure chest necessary to take the case to trial. You will probably have to consult with several firms to find one willing to take the case. A Google search will reveal dozens of firms handling these cases. Your dad should contact one of these firms for a free consultation. They will gather information from him in the necessary medical records to determine whether he has a viable claim. As far as I am aware, individuals who used round up for residential use are unlikely to have enough exposure to have a viable case from a causation perspective. The successful Clement have primarily been commercial users.
