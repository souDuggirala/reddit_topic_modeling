 Purchased new vehicle 12/17/18, finance manager snuck in extended warranty (my fault for signing), but I know I am able to cancel it. Should the dealer continue to drag their feet on cancelling it and updating the paperwork concerning the amount financed what legal recourse do I have? Apologies if this has been answered before, I attempted to look but found varying degrees of answers and such. Thanks! Thank you much You should read whatever you signed and follow whatever exact cancellation procedure is outlined in there to a T, documenting each step to the best of your ability.
