 So I live in BC and I have an older brother. Since I was little he always "bugged" me as my parents would say. But when I would talk to my friends and really look at how their siblings acted, it never felt anything like how my brother acted towards me. My brother constantly hurts my siblings and I, he also has that look and feeling like he could hurt you at any second which is terrifying. My youngest brother (7) is the sweetest boy but my older brother swears at him and hurts him, I have cried many times over what my older brother tells him to say. He teaches him swear words, tells him the grossest things, and to get in trouble in school. This I'm afraid will mess my younger brother up. When my parents go out of the room they ask to babysit him to make sure that he doesn't get hurt which hurts me more thinking about what he has done to me when I was my youngest brothers age and that he could do it again. I have gone to 3 therapists for my severe anxiety and depression caused by the traumatic events with my older brother, and I honestly think that if he got the chance, he would kill me. My parents have been trying to find a solution to my brother and to try and stop him From acting as if he has no heart. I wish I didn't have to live my life with my greatest dream being to get away from my him. I have no idea what to do, I just know that I can't live in the same home as him and that he needs serious help. I'm not sure what to do regarding the police, I just want him away from my family and I.
