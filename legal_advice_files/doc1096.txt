 As the title says, I got into a car accident that was my fault due to running a stop sign. I just want to know what actions I can take as of now. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you. Ok thank you for your help. I appreciate it You need to call your insurance company, which you have already done. It is not the insurance company's job to defend any tickets. If you want to fight the ticket, you can do so yourself or you can hire an attorney that practices in the area. As far as the rest of the case, if the person wasn't hurt, then your car insurance should pay to repair the car and that will be the end of it. If the person was hurt, then the other person may end up suing you. Don't panic if that happens. Your insurance company is obligated to defend you. Don't take legal advice from cops, as a general rule. Traffic attorney will make this easier. Oh, so you got a ticket? What exact code were you cited under? Pay it, contest it, ask the court what other options are available, or hire a traffic attorney to handle it in your stead. I always choose the latter option for any ticket, big or small. I have already done that. I was just wondering on the legal side of things like pleading guilty or not guilty because an officer was telling me that if I plead not guilty and explain to the judge that it is my first accident, they might not give me the points and I will just have to pay more money. Call your insurance company.
