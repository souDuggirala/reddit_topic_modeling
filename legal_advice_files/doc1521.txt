 I worked for a software company in sales. I put my 2 week notice in on January 2nd. They asked me to go that day and deactivated all my accounts internally. They said are paying my two weeks to me which is nice. It is now the 16th and I have not received a check and they have also not communicated to me what my commissions totals where for my last month. They also said they are not paying me for a deal I closed that would have been paid to me next month because I quit. My questions are this: 1. Do I have any legal recourse to get paid on commissions that are to be paid in the future? 2. Final checks in California are due within 72 hrs of resignation. I know they said they would pay my two weeks does this mean my separation date is the final day of the 2 weeks? I was walked out of the building on January 2nd. Thanks in advance.
