 We've been in the flat for a little over 2 weeks, it's a 1 bed in london, england. There are a shitload of issues with the flat including no hot water for over a week (causing me to get a cold and take time off work), a hob with only one working ring that trips the fuses for the whole flat, a gate buzzer with audio that doesn't work and holes in the laminate flooring showing carpet underneath. We asked for some specific stuff to be done before move in, some of which still isn't done. We think we should be able to get some money back as we paid £354 in admin fees and £1050 rent per month, we were forced to move in late due to the flat legally needing to have radiators to be habitable, I've taken a lot of time off work due to being sick and having to be in for people to do work on the flat etc. How much money do you think we should ask for? reduced rent until its all fixed? permanently reduced rent? Thanks so much for the advice! I'll list a full set of problems here: - no hot water for over a week - broken hob - extractor fan in kitchen falling off ceiling - showerhead electrical taped to the wall - entryphone audio doesn't work - bedroom window closure doesn't work/lock - key rusted into sliding door - paintings stuck to wall, painted around - holes in laminate flooring, carpet underneath - curtain pole in living room coming away from the ceiling, bowing - curtain pole in bedroom just came off the wall, showing old curtain rail underneath - radiators not replaced before move in - washing machine not fitted before move in - cleaning not done before move in, fridge coated in mold and unusable  I think you may need r/legaladviceuk
