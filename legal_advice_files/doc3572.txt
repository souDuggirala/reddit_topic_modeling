 My family member is The company is large, What would be a good next step? Your asking advice on how you should respond to a termination letter but none of us know what the letter actually says. Itâ€™s hard for anyone to give you good advice.  I don't have it available to me right now; is there something that I should look for?  I would at least call some employment lawyers. This is a complicated area of the law - I don't believe this scenario is explicitly illegal, but there have been lawsuits for similar circumstances. I've seen at least two interpretations: that the firings are a violation of ERISA (which does not directly protect this but does regulate health plans broadly), or that they're a veiled form of age discrimination against the 40+ (which is explicitly prohibited under the ADEA).  Do you have the exact wording of the letter? PII redacted of course.
