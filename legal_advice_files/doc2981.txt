 I am currently senior at the University of Delaware (Newark, DE) and last night I received an open container ticket. I was leaving a party at a friends house with a bottle of tequila, I was about a block away from my house when a Newark PD officer pulls me over an issues me the ticket. I am over the age of 21 and besides a noise violation I received two years ago I have a clean record. I was wondering if any one had any advice on what my next course of action should be. [Here](=CH22POOF_ARTXCOINBE) is the link to the town code in which they address open containers. I don't want this to end up on my record and possibly jeopardize my opportunity for any future employment. I appreciate any and all advice.  You should pay the fine and just move on with your life.
