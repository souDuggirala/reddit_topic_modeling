 I have Aetna and for the last 2 years they have claimed my son isn't on my insurance... First right after his birth and we get on OK it looks like when you submitted his ssn something happened and it didn't go through. They agreed to cover the 20k bill. At 1.5 years old I have to pay a 1000 dollar bill for all of his routine vaccinations and wellness visits and get some crap about how the claims never processed correctly and all the visits should be covered. I got a 800 dollar refund for that instance.. At 1.75 years old they refuse to cover his 10 minute ear tube surgery claiming that they have information that he may have other insurance such as Medicaid. My wife and I are married and together we made a significant amount over the national median income and have never even applied for benefits... My question is if they pull something worse in 2019 do I have to immediately drop money on a lawyer or is there some state agency in NY I can go to, to complain or is it better to try to report it to a journalist or even threaten to tell a journalist? Is this through an employer? If so, let HR know. They or their broker can escalate this too. Escalate this by sending a copy of all these issues to the person at your work in charge of managing the company account- this is their job. If you handle this privately- ask to speak to an account manager so this can be settled. It is routine to add new dependants- someone is neglecting protocol. You can file a complaint with the New York Department of Financial Services: For general information about your rights as a health insurance consumer:
