 My washing machine stopped working a week ago. It wouldn’t drain and my clothes, towels, and half my bedding has been inside ever since. I’ve tried getting them out but the water is ice cold, deep, and the clothes are all twisted together making it near impossible. Anyway, my landlord told me to call his handyman. Handyman came out and didn’t know what was wrong, and said he’d have to come back the next night. Next night I get home late from work and he says he doesn’t have time, totally fine. I got to talking with my coworkers about him and they had awful things to say- that my coworker hired him to fix her roof and he took the money and ran, sexual abuse allegations, etc. I’m 23F and live alone and now I’m nervous to be alone with him. I expressed my concerns to my landlord and he basically said, “Oh no he’s a nice guy! He wouldn’t do that.” But I’m still nervous. He has no-showed the last 2 times he’s been scheduled to come. Landlord said he wouldn’t foot the bill if I hired anyone else. Can he do that? Reposted: I’m in Maine They already do smell unfortunately, I managed to get some stuff out on the first day and dried them and they still smelled awful. There was a burning plastic smell coming from the washer and it was sort of that scent. The handyman was supposed to come siphon the water out and that’s when he’s no showed. Use a siphon to drain it into a sink. Or vacuum out the water with a wet dry vac. Or take the water out one cup at a time. I wouldn’t leave my wet clothes in there too long or they may start to smell.
