 I live in the same house as my landlords, they are an older couple and I have a second floor apartment that is part of their house but separated. The house has those old cast iron radiators and that is shared for the whole house. (They control the temperature) since the weather dropped back in October, they have been using it, which is fine but the problem is that these radiators sound really loud, almost as if someone was hitting them with a steel pipe, is not a pattern and it is really random, the sounds can be repetitive and the loudness varies. I’m a light sleeper and this sounds wake me up and interrupt my sleep. i work from 4am-12pm and I go to bed usually around 7-8pm and wake up around 2:30am. I asked her plenty of times to have someone look at the heading system to see a possible solution but she never takes me seriously, the first time she smile and said “that is part of the charm of the house, don’t worry you will get used to it!” It’s been a couple months and I’m not used to it, I have tried earplugs and they don’t work, I also suggested to her that she could hired someone to disconnect the heat from my apartment only but nothing has happened, we also tried turning the heat off during my sleep hours but in the end they always end up turning the heat on during my sleep time, which I understand, the weather it’s cold, but the situation is starting to become repetitive and a little hostile, she refuses to meet me half way or have the system fix. I’m not sure what my rights are as a tenant and I really don’t want to move given than this location is very convenient for my job. Anyone have any suggestions?
