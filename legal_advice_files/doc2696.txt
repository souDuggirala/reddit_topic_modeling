 Location WV, MD maybe TX? Got a call today from a self identified process server, he said that he had a civil suit in my name. Gave me a phone number and a case number. Wouldn't tell me who the plaintiff was or anything else. (Why would a process server warn me that he was looking for me?) I called the number and spoke with some guy that told me I owed $500 for an old closed checking account from 2010. I asked some questions: I asked if he was an attorney and he told me he was a mediator, I kept pushing and he said he was a paralegal. I asked who the plantiff was, and again he wouldn't tell me. He kept asking me if I remembered the account etc. I told him I had no idea what he was talking about. He eventually got frustrated and hung up on me. The case number they gave me is definitely not a civil case number from WV, where the process server claimed to be. The phone number was from Texas. And I live in Maryland. What should i do? I don't want to get a default judgement entered against me. This is a scam. Until there is a knock at your door, with someone asking for a signature for process, you have nothing to worry about.  Yes.
