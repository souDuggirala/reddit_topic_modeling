 I currently have an out of state class C driverâ€™s license (MO) and I want to buy a vehicle here in CA. Is this legal? So long as I eventually get my drivers license transferred to CA is this acceptable? Any other tips in this process you can think of would help.   If you have valid ID from any state, and a California insurance policy, you can register a vehicle in California at your California address. You have to get a California driver's license within 10 days of establishing residency. But you can buy, insure, and register a car before you do that.
