 Have gotten to the point of needing to file chapter 7. I have lived almost 3 years in Georgia coming from California where I have a house there. Lost job beginning of this year and medical issues, still can't find work. Going to move back to California back into my home there to hopefully help chances of finding job. If no luck within the 91 days, I'd file for bankruptcy in California. Do I get to use California exemptions at that point? Talked with lawyer in Georgia and they said I'd only need to live there for 90 days, but I see different things on the internet so just want to make sure before leaving the state to move back there if I would end up losing my home because it's not true then have to move back to Georgia.
