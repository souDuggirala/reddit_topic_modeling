 So I'm moving out of the house I rent and my roommate says he might stay and find another roommate. Which is fine. However when I spoke with the company that writes the lease company over the house I was told that the deposit return check will be written to everyone in the house. So if he stays I can't get the deposit back. They said that if he has someone ready to move in and applied to move and they have the paperwork done they might be able to work something out with the deposit. Is this something they can do? Like if I don't renew the lease isn't whats agreed to no longer valid? I just wanna be sure I get my part of the deposit back when I leave. Thank you. Also, we are in Florida. Ok. Thank you. It's just stressful cause I'm moving to another state and 1500$ is a lot of money (for me) Then he can either pay for the whole lease/deposit himself or he can move out. Once Lease A is complete, then you're not on the hook anymore. If he signs Lease B, then it's on him. You just need to make sure Lease A is closed and you have no obligations to Lease B. What happens in the even that he doesn't find someone? Then here's what you need: Current lease = Lease A Roommate/His Future Roommate's lease = Lease B Have Lease A officially end so both you and roommate get your deposit back. Roommate can sign Lease B with whomever and then apply the deposit he received from Lease A to Lease B. Same lease Are you and your roommate on the same lease or do you each have separate leases?
