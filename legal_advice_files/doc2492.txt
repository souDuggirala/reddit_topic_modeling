 The age of majority in my country is 18 and I’m not 18 anymore, neither do my ex partner. We broke up after her 18 and I still have hot pictures of her. We broke up in good terms and I asked her about those pictures, she doesn’t care, she trusts me and knows I’m not going to share it or whatever. The problem is if someone find those pictures in my computer, am I going to go to jail? I asked a friend about it and he said I should delete them, but they are a part of my past I don’t wanna forget it. Plus it’s not all about hot pictures, I still have beautiful portraits etc... I’m not into child at all, but I’m wondering if this is considered as pedo-porn stuff...
