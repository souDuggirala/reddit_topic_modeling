 So 2 weeks ago my mom was pulled over by a cop for improper lane change. Take note that my mom wasn't speeding and she used indicators when we wanted to change lanes. The cop that pulled her over said that she changed her lane 2 times so he pulled my mom over and asked if she was in a rush. She really wasn't. My mom has to go to court to testify against the ticket and say that it doesn't make any sense because she wasn't speeding nor cut anyone off to cause a accident. Any advice?? So she turned her indicator light on for each action. That is what you are supposed to do it. It becomes improper when you use one signal event to traverse more than one lane. I wonder if the cop missed the second (or first) time your mom used her indicator. [deleted] Did she use one indication to go across two lanes? Or two separate indications to go across two lanes? If she got a ticket for a violation, then clearly that is something that can happen. Whether or not she violated the specific law she was charged with will depend on exactly how the law in that unnamed city and state reads. Which we can't know because you did not give us the location or the specific statute or ordinance number she was charged with violating.  Location matters, traffic laws are different in different places.
