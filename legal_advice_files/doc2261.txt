 We are in NSW, Australia. This happened a few weeks ago. A woman in her early 20’s (C) entered my family’s store in a large mall. Upon exit, one of my staff (S) asked to check her bags but she kept walking, ignoring S. S pursued C outside the store down the hall and attempted to block C’s path, but C shoved past her. S never made bodily contact with her, except pointing to her plastic bag asking to check it. S kept blocking her, and eventually C decided to comply and was escorted back to the store. By the time she entered the store, C was having a full panic attack/meltdown in tears. The manager on duty saw her in tears and decided to just let her go without checking the bags. Later on, mall security came in and told us that C had contacted the police. Nothing happened for a few weeks, until today. The police came into the store and took the managers statement on what happened. He told them exactly what happened above. The only thing is that he didn’t give S’s phone number for a statement. S also does not want to give a statement. The manager gave the police my dad’s number instead. What can my dad do in this situation? S does not want to talk to the police. Is it illegal to refuse S’s phone number? What can we do to protect ourselves? I don’t think we did anything wrong - S didn’t touch C once. All she did was block her path. C shoved S out of the way, and is now claiming that S assaulted her. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!  Thank you so much - will post there! /r/AusLegal is probably your best bet. Most people here focus on US and Canadian law.
