 SASKATCHEWAN. My shift hours are to be 10pm-6am Monday night to Friday morning. So technically I'm getting Sunday night off till Monday morning and being paid for that. But still have to come in Family Day 10pm. I was specifically told that I would not be paid OT for the two stat hours because they're going to pay out my rate for Sunday night. I feel like I'm being ripped off, is it legal? Do I go to HR? Would the labour board help at all?
