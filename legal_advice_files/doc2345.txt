 I got a personalized fake front license plate for Christmas. I live in a state that only requires rear plates, so fake/decorative plates are perfectly fine for the front plate area. The only hitch is that this plate looks very much like a real license plate from another state - New Mexico. [(Link to photo of plate)]() I am a big Better Call Saul fan and would like to use this, but I am concerned about the legality of having a plate that appears to be real. Could I get in trouble for using this? More trouble than just being asked to remove it? Thank you in advance for your help.  My advice is to take it off out of state, and whenever you are driving home with male friends, or around the holidays at night or from parties. They pull people over for NO reason, manufacturing probable cause as they go. This gives them no need to manufacture probable cause so they can concentrate on screwing you. Reply I appreciate the response, thank you. I am going to hang it up somewhere instead of using on my car.   Probably, yes. You haven't said what state you live in, but they probably have some sort of law against driving a car with falsified license plates. Even if this one is supposed to be a joke, the fact that it looks like a real plate is likely to cause you trouble. This is one of those situations where even if it isn't technically illegal, the constant hassle and harassment you will get from doing it just makes it totally not worth it. Don't do it, man. Hang it up in your man cave or something.
