 My brother is being held involuntarily in a mental health hospital in IL. He has asked me to find a lawyer for him. What kind of lawyer should I find?  Thank you Illinois' state bar offers a lawyer referral service: []() Yeah, that’s for sure. My understanding is that he does have the right for legal representation in hearings that are held at the hospital. So, that’s what I am looking for.  Generally the point of involuntary commitment is that the patient has been deemed a risk to themselves and therefore can't be released, even if they want to be.
