 Hi long time lurker, first time poster. Location is Pennsylvania. My mom asked me to ask reddit about this possible future problem. The neighbor in the lot behind my parent’s house had a gorgeous huge tree in their backyard that was healthy for years. Unfortunately for the past couple of years the tree has been looking more sickly, with branches with no leaves and branches falling off. My mom worries that if a bad storm comes and the wind blows in the wrong direction the tree could fall on her house. If damage happens who is liable for this? Would my parent’s homeowners insurance cover this? Or my neighbor’s homeowners insurance? Thanks for input. Thank you for your answer! It depends on if the tree is actually dying. An arborist would be able to determine if the tree is diseased and can be saved or if it needs to come down. Many healthy trees drop branches from time to time. If the homeowner is aware that their tree is diseased/dying/dead and they don't do anything about it, then they are liable for the damage. Sometimes it takes your parent's homeowners insurance covering it and then going after the other party's insurance for reimbursement. Now if the tree is healthy it is considered an act of God and your parent's insurance should cover it. Here's an article that better answers the question: []()
