 My brother passed away and we have been going through the process of everything that goes along with that. Well we just discovered he is technically still married even though they've been separated for two years. One does this change any of the funeral arrangements we've already made? and 2) what about life insurance? She said she would sign what ever she needs to, to make my mom the beneficiary. What do we need to sign? or what kind of attorneys? Had they filed a separation agreement with the court? Best of luck and sorry about your brother. It can be tough losing a sibling.  Thank you I appreciate all your help.  If no beneficiary listed, then it might go to her by default as she was his spouse.  Well there was no beneficiary listed. She said she would sign whatever needed to make it go to my mother.  Probate attorney. Did he switch beneficiary on life insurance policy? If not, it goes to her. She can then gift it to your mother, but not required to. Assuming he died intestate (without a will), look to [these rules](). Basically, she gets everything.
