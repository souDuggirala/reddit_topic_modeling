 If someone were to steal a vessel at what point is it no longer just stealing someones property vs piracy laws? Is it a size/value of the vessel thing, or does it matter if there are people on the boat? Not a personal question, just something that crossed my mind. Hush your mouth. I technically have a fleet. Ehhh. Grand larceny is usually theft over 1000, Bayliner are the Lada’s of boats, they aren’t worth the minimum. :) [18 USC §1651]( did=12005) defines Piracy as a robbery of a vessel at sea, and several pirate captured off Africa by the US Navy have been tried under that statutes in the US. But in general it's a matter of "the law of nations" and is more complex, and often punished by the Navy in... a summary fashion. If you break into the Lakeshore Marina and steal somebody's Bayliner, that's ordinary grand theft. /r/legaladviceofftopic is for hypotheticals
