 Sooooooo my landlord sucks. We’ve had a long history of him not following through on promised repairs. However, a big issue is our windows. We live in a Bay Area apartment with single pane swing out windows. They are poorly sealed and extremely drafty. Our apartment gets freezing cold during the day, wind blows in through the cracks, they sweat due to the changing temperatures and leak all over the windowsill and the floor— both warping the wooden floor boards and creating mold growth on our window frame. He told me he would not repair the windows and that the sweating/mold was somehow due to my cats litterbox in the bathroom (??????) Is there anything I can do?  Check your lease. Get it in writing/email they he was notified of the issue and refused to fix it. Document the problem with pictures. Pay someone to fix it they send him the bill/demand it be taken off your rent. If he refuses sue him and take the slumlord to small claims. Begin looking for a new joint.
