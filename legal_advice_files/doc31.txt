 I moved into an apartment a few months ago and have decided that the apartment doesn't fit my personal preferences. The lease states that when I breach the contract "the Owner shall be entitled to recover all damafes occasioned thereby, including leasing commissions, advertising expenses, utilities maintained to show the Premises, and all unpaid rent until the term of the lease" Does this mean that I am liable for all expenses incurred in the apartment's efforts to replace me? And if they replace me, I am resolved of responsibility? And I'm hoping it doesn't come to this, but on the lease I signed it stated that I would have a Washer/Dryer in unit and not a microwave. The apartment I received did not have a W/D but did have a microwave. When I brought it up upon move in, the complex said that the appliances were implied throughout the lease. Since I brought up the problem and it wasn't resolved, would that be considered in breach on the apartment side? I only verbally asked about this and did not have it in writing.
