 I was the victim of a a con artist who was just convicted in Criminal Court of Grand Theft by Inducement for scamming me. Now I'm making a documentary about my experience. The judge allowed cameras in the courtroom so the entire trial was filmed. And my perpetrator is in jail now. Do I have the right show video and pictures of my con artist to tell my story of how they scammed me? (without their permission) including court room footage as well as any other pictures and videos I found of this perp.  Will do. I basically told the WHOLE story of how she scammed me in court to the jury in 4 hours of grueling testimony. 3 other witnesses testified against her as well. She did not testify nor did she have any witness testify in her defense. The jury deliberated for 3 hours and came back with a guilty verdict. So yeah basically everything in the doc will be what was said in court.  As long as there is no court order saying otherwise, sure. But make sure you only say 100% truth. So only saying they did exactly what they were convicted of, when talking criminal.  Yes. Ia actually own most of the pictures and videos. This convicted con artist posed as my neighbor for 4 years while she was hiding from authorities. Do I have the right to use all the pictures and video I took of us now that she's been convicted of scamming me? You would need permission to use others copywritten material. Videos, pictures and the like
