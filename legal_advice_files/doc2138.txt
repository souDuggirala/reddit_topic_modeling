 I’m not sure if I can be helped here. I had a surgery a year ago that prevented me from running, leaving me with some nerve damage in my leg. I can still do basic things like walking and lifting. I have a job interview that requires a physical ability test. I had a phone interview and have not disclosed my concerns to this employee. I’m not sure if this company will require me to run during this test. Can a company not hire me if I am unable to run if asked? They are not allowed to discriminate against you if and only if your medical problem isn't relevant to the job. If your medical condition means you can't perform the necessary responsibilities of the job, they can choose not to hire you. This is why we don't see any soccer refs in wheel chairs or driving instructors that are blind.
