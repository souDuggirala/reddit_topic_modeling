 My 5 year old GE profile dishwasher out of nowhere, started on fire. Luckily, I happen to actually be in the room when it started, and put it out immediatly. Because of that, I can see exactly where the fire started. It's a cord fire. So I googled, and apparently these fires have been going on for long over a decade with lots of recalls from all sorts of brands. They used the wrong cords. My dishwasher serial number wasn't on the recall list, but I didn't buy it till 2013, so changing the sticker would be a easy way for the manufacturer to hide the flaw. What are my rights? Do I contact a lawyer(would prefer not to make a big thing) but I want my dishwasher replaced! We have had to do a ton of cleanup because if this and miss work.

File a report here and click box to share with the manufacturer . I did this, got contacted by the manufacturer, they sent a repairman to investigate and file another report, the manufacturer got back to me and offered me a free dishwasher of equal or less msrp if they could retrieve the old one for analysis.  Homeowner's insurance would probably cover incidental damage, if not the dishwasher itself (never made a claim myself, but I know they can have different coverages).
