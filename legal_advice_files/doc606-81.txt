This morning my husband and I dropped off my car to get my state inspection done. They said it would take 4-5 hours. My fault for procrastinating so it’s no big deal. 

However, after 6 hours we call and it’s still not done. My husband gives them my phone number because he’s about to go to work. I call two more times and they don’t answer. 

8 hours after we dropped off the car they close. I never got a call. So I drove over to the garage to see if they are still working. They are all gone and it is pitch black inside. 

I drive around to my car to find that it is finished and the inspection papers with the bill have been left inside. I really needed my car tomorrow but they are going to be closed so I can’t pay the bill and get my key. 

So the question is, can I get in legal trouble for taking the car with my spare key and paying the bill Monday morning? What if I left the money ($16) in their key drop off box?  Thank you for taking the time to reply!  Do not even think about it. Even dropping the payment in the mail slot and taking it.

No it's not legal.
