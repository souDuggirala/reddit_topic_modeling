 I run a famous instagram page showcasing vintage photography by others. Would I be able to construct a magazine compiling these photos, putting them in collages, etc. as long as I give credit to the photographer on the bottom? I will add there is a caveat for transformative works, but what you described would not be transformative. No, you can't legally do that. Credit/attribution does not equal a license to use copyrighted works. If you get sued, you would most definitely lose.
