 I just a received a letter that they do not think I suffered diminished value from the accident I was in and will not pay anything. I spoke with two seperate appraisers who gave me estimates of $5500 and $3500 for my diminished value claim due to body frame damage. Do I send them a letter telling them I will take them to small claims court? I just don’t want it to come off like I’m threatening them.  State farm? Screw them farmers Fucking bastards. How could they possibly say something like that? Everyone knows no one wants dirty Carfax record. You can at least tell me the name of the insurance company right since they are being such assholes to you? im not gonna get into the car but i just went with an appraiser. the insurance came to me twice saying there was $0 in DV Who came back saying that? The person wrote your report or the insurance company. Did you go with an attorney or just an appraiser? If you don't mind, what year and make was your car? Thanks
