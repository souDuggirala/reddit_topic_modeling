 I had consented to protected sex with a guy, he removed the condom without my knowledge. I didn’t realize this until he ejaculated inside me and I felt it. I asked him what he had just done and he said “oh, it’s this trick that guys do”. I made him leave because I was extremely distraught and crying. I texted him and asked him what had happened. He kept changing his story. At first he told me that he took the condom off, then pulled out. He told me that what I had felt was just it leaking onto my vagina. After I had told him that I feel as if I was sexually assaulted, he changed his story and said that he never removed the condom at all. I only consented to protected sex. I did not consent to unprotected sex. He came to my house with plan b about 2 hours later and held it captive until he got on video that I consented to protected sex and that he never removed the condom. I HAD to. I had no other means of acquiring plan b because I am only 16. Would this even stand in a court of law? I have all the screenshots as proof, saying that he removed the condom. Plan b is only 95% effective. I feel raped. I have a heavy sense of grief and anxiety. I’m only 16 and this was my first time. Is there anything that could be done legally? He has blocked me on everything and made me delete his number in front of him, I still have his number because he’s an idiot and doesn’t realize it still shows up in recents. Please help. Thank you. (Second post because the first one violated this sub’s rules)  Yes this is rape. Im incredibly sorry you fell victim to this creep. Go to the police immediately
