 I was in Afghanistan for about 9 months, during this time the two people my wife was living with had a domestic violence incident. Cops were called, wife had to hide in a closet from the guy, etc. Next day the cops escorted my wife to get all of our stuff and leave. I tried contacting them to get our rent for that month back but was told no, and also tried contacting them about my wife having left stuff in the house that totals over $1000 worth of stuff. They will not respond. Just got back to the United States, thinking about going to their door to try and talk to them in person. Curious what my legal options are.... You don't post your location, but no, in most places that isn't a proper reason to stop paying rent. You still owe notice and rent for that period. What if the guy was stalking around the house saying he was going to kill her and then threw all of our stuff on the lawn while the cops were there, screaming about not ever coming back again.... Seems like we should have legal recourse for essentially being kicked out or leaving a dangerous situation... no? That's fine. In that case, your wife would almost assuredly owe them proper notice to leave, and rent for that time. She generally can't just up and leave. You don't post your location, but in most places she'd owe 30 days. Separately, you can sue them for the items left behind. In most places, you can only realistically get the value of those items.  Unfortunately no, we were just renting a room and there was no paperwork. Just a text trail at this point. I thought they owned the house but it turned out they were renting as well. Did your wife have a lease for this living situation?
