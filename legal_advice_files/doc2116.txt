 I sold my car months ago to some guy, signed the title and two copies of a bill of sale, one for him and one for me. He gave me the money and drove away. I went to the DMV and turned in my registration the next day and flagged the interest and put his name as the owner. That was the last I have heard of it, then I just got a letter from a towing company saying there is a lien on my old car. I called the tow company and they said they need a copy of the flagged interest from the DMV the bill of sale will not do it, so I went back to the dmv and it has to get mailed to me from Salem. My question is, will a lien against a car I used to have affect me or my credit score in any way? I do not want to help the guy I sold my car to. This has been a major hassle. Can I just ignore the notice and let the car go to auction? Thanks. [removed] It sounds like the buyer never actually took the signed over title into the DMV to have it titled in their name. Even though OP went into the DMV and did everything they were supposed to do on their end the buyer never did. If that's the case it would still be titled in OPs name and when the tow truck ran the VIN it still came up in OPs name. Definitely get it taken care of - do not ignore it. A mechanics lien can affect your credit if reported to one of the agencies. The only good liens are those that result as using property as collateral for a loan/line of credit.  A very similar thing happened to me years ago, but if it's not against you or your credit and the car isn't in your name, there is no course of action you really need to take. It wouldn't hurt to send the tow company the info if they're reputable, but put everything in writing via email if possible, just in case.
