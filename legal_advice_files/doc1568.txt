 My divorce lawyer previously I assume like most told me that he would fight for behalf and he recognized my financial restraints and continued to reassure me. Fast forward a couple months later he is ignoring my concerns, he scheduled a meeting the other day and when I showed up he was leaving his office saying he was short on time, frankly he is treating me like shit. We were supposed to have a court date in December but the other parties lawyer said they were “busy the entire month” and would be available the following month. So it is now the following month and she said she has a family arrangement RIGHT on the date we had planned to go and she spoke to my lawyer asking if we could reschedule so she could buy a ticket to her sons football game across the country that day?????? I don’t know what to do anymore i’m sick to my stomach all most everyday, i’m about to lose my house and no one gives a fuck. - I had told my lawyer I would lose my house and he continued to laugh and said it would be to our benefit? I just really need some advice on what to do that this point.
