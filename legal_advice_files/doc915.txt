 In California. So I first want to say that while I have graduated law school, I have no experience in this area of law and even if I did I know that I am not legally allowed to give legal advice, so I thought it was best to reach out to r/legaladvice and ask your thoughts. Last year, my friend was struggling and got a 51/50. He incurred a lot of expenses but after working with Medical almost all of expenses were taken care of, aside from one. A psychiatrist he saw while in the situation saw him one time for 15 minutes, asked generic questions, and diagnosed him as depressed. The psychiatrist is now claiming he saw my buddy three days in a row and made decisions on what medications he should take, which my friend says didn’t happen. The psychiatrist had told my friend that he owes him $1000, and Medical won’t cover it. They are threatening to send it to collections. He can’t afford the payment, they won’t return his calls, and he feels like the psychiatrist is being fraudulent. Is it possible to avoid paying some or all of the bill without it negatively affecting his credit?
