 I resale for a living and recently I had one of the persons I buy bulk Server Hardware run off with 4.2k worth of my money. I have all the convos of our agreement for said merchandise along with his legal name, phone number and address. I would like to say the payment was done through PayPal friends and family so theyll will be records of payment along with written texts of purchase. How likely am I to win? Or should I just move on with the loss and not bother with suing.  So what exactly is the issue here? Did you send the money and not receive the item? Was the item in poor condition? Was it not what you were expecting?  Just bring printouts of your transactions and conversations. Don't put it on a board. You'll have to sue them in their jurisdiction. What can you bring to court? Ive never been to one and had wished to avoid one. Is it possible to bring a posterboard with printings of everything? Going by only what you've written (paid for product, seller refuses to send product or reimburse), you shpuld probably win. Collecting is another matter though. Thank you for the reply. Ill take a swing.  If you have proof of payments and can show that you never received any merchandise, you could sue in small claims. Because that is the payment weve agreed on, I also sold hardware to him as well. Ive been purchasing from the same seller for months now. I'd assume the trust would be there.   So is there actual proof of payment or are you just making that up? And if it was a business deal, why was it done as a F F transaction?
