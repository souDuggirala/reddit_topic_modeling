 I moved into my new apartment and the tennant before me was ordering prepped meals through one of the fast growing companies similar to blue apron. When I received her first box full of meals I found her on FB and told her. She responded that she got her correct order and was only charged once. Somehow the identical delivery is getting delivered to my apt free of charge. I have received 3 (still in contact with her) and have been eating them. I know I should probably call/email the company and let them know but I was going to let it ride out for a couple weeks to see if it stops. 1) Can the company somehow try and charge me if they were to find out X boxes were accidentally sent? There is really no proof that I ate them except for the delivery driver saying he delivered them. 2) The mail owner knows, however, are there still legal ramifications for opening the box? Is she really the only one who could 'press charges' or whatever happens for opening someone's mail. I guess I have permission? 3) Is there really nothing that can go wrong except that I am being an unethical asshole for not telling the company? TL;DR Receiving old tennants meals, she knows and not being charged for the duplicate delivery, I am eating them, could the company force me to pay? Theft is theft. Call the company and tell them old tenant does not live there anymore. Offer to donate some money to compensate them for the additional delivery to you and tell them it took you a bit to figure out what was happening. Do the ethical thing.
