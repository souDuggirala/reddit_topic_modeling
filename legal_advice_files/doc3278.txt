 So in September, before a concert, I was parked rolling a blunt getting ready for this concert. I had smoked about 2 and a half hours prior, and my car was on because I needed the AC on (Vegas heat). Cops rolled up, sobriety test, arrest occurs, and I am in Jail for a couple days before I am bailed out. I hired a defense attorney, and he told me to sit tight until 2 things happen: 1. The DMV sends me a letter of my license getting revoked, 2. The states brings charges forward and discovery occurs. It is Christmas Eve, and I just received a letter from the DMV saying my license was revoked. I am worried because I know that the hearing must occur within a certain time frame if I want any hope of keeping my license. Since it is the day before Christmas, I called my case manager and to no avail no one answered. I then called the law office, and they took my information down and said someone would reach out to me. I made a mistake, and being in a commuter school I am looking for any way to keep my license. My license would be suspended until March 27th. I guess I am just freaking out because it is the day before Christmas and I have no clue what is going to happen. I dont even know what advice can be given to me, I guess I am just seeking a semblance of hope that this situation might get better. I have talked to others that have gotten alcohol DUIS but I dont know anyone who has gotten a marijuana DUI. Also, there is something on the DMV sheet that says if I install an interlock device on my car I will be able to keep my license. Is this worth pursuing even though it is a marijuana DUI? I have no clue what the next step is and since it is the day before Christmas I feel dead in the water as to my options.  Consult with a lawyer
