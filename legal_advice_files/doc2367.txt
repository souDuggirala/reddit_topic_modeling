 I'm not sure if this is the best place to come but I'm gonna try. My family (particularly my mother and I) have been involved with this one family since a was a kid. Through the years the situation has become increasingly worse, horribly abusive father and a compliant mother who has certainly become a perpetrator in this. My mother's role in this has become support the kids as best as she could because honestly she feels powerless to do anything. I was best friends with the oldest when we were in elementary school together. My mom and this woman used to be friends because I think my mom saw her as a broken person who needed help to escape her abusive husband. She told my mom pretty much everything. Over time it's become clear that this woman is likely withholding certain details about stories to protect herself, a sort of unreliable narrator. CPS has conducted a few investigations based on the calls my mother has made, each time told us there was nothing they could do. "We don't like to tear families apart" aka we don't like to tear upper-middle-class, six-figure making, government employed families apart. I fell out of touch with the oldest because my family had to relocate for a few years, but my mom managed to get into contact again with the mother when we came back to my hometown. The children are getting older and this situation is becoming darker. The middle kid is showing signs of a serious mental illness and has been hurting themselves, but the parents won't get this kid any help further than what is free (which isn't a lot). I'm sure they are worried this kid will say something. The youngest one is becoming just like their father and it is terrifying because they are so young. Something need to be done and I don't know what to do. CPS has told us to fuck off and we don't know what to do from here. My mom is in a weird place where she wants to be there for the kids but can't stand to be there for that woman.
