 I am crying writing this, F 16 here, several friends and other survivors have told me they have been abused and manipulated and pressured to have sex while underage with a certain musician. For 3 years people have called him out over social media for his horrible actions. Emailed a local venue that he is playing a show at about his actions. Several pals have emailed their local venues too. Got an email from this musician's lawyer about how I should stop spreading false rumors. I am hurt. I am crying, I am 16, my friends and I, we are all so young and trying to protect each other from other girls getting hurt. I do not know what to do, I can't stay silent, after all the hurtful things I have heard him do to my friends, and their friends, I am so sad that I am being threatened to stay silent. What do I do????  If you did not experience or witness this abuse firsthand, you can be sued for defamation. If you want to help your friend(s) encourage them to file a complaint with the police. Then you will have something tangible to stand on.
