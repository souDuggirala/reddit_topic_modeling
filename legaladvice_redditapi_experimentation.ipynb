       "   'selftext': \"Hi all! Thank you in advance for any help, I really appreciate it.\\n\\nI am a graduate student and rented a room in CT near my school. The lease was for an individual room and covered a full calendar year, August 1, 2019 to August 1, 2020. The house had two other tenants on their own leases for varying dates. I briefly met the landlord once or twice, but only after occupying the property. A family member handled the orignial showing and lease signing.\\n\\nIn May, my landlord texted me to ask if I would be staying for the next year. I said yes, but he did not say anything about resigning or signing a new lease. In July, due to classes being moved online, I decided to move out and find a new apartment. Two weeks in advance, I let my landlord know I would be leaving on August 1, he responded by asking about the other tenant still there. He said nothing about me leaving, but he read my message and responded. He knew what day I would be vacating the property. My lease states nothing about notice requirements.\\n\\nCome August 1, all my stuff is out but he hasn't contacted me or shown up. The lease states the landlord needs to be present for damage assessment. I didn't think to take pictures of my room, which was dumb on my part. But, I have two witnesses. The room was cleared out and vacuumed and cleaned, and the house is currently still occupied by another tenant. I left my keys on the kitchen table and left. \\n\\nHere's what happened after I moved out:\\nI contacted my landlord the next day stating I had officially left the previous day, and asked when I could expect my security deposit refund. He said I broke my promises, and wouldn't give my deposit back. He said 30 days of notice is required, so he wouldn't give my deposit back. My lease specifically states the deposit will be refunded once the tenant vacated the property, there are no restrictions based off of notice of vacant requirements. I haven't been able to find any legal requirements for a vacancy notice unless I wanted to have an early lease termination, so that doesn't apply to me. I sent screenshots of my copy of the lease, and he replied saying that I broke my promises and left him dry. There is already one room in the house to fill and as far as I know he hasn't made any efforts to fill it (I found the post for the housing in an online group for my university). Also, filling the rooms in not my responsibility and it does not say I have to do this anywhere in the lease.\\n\\nI did NOT resign or sign a new lease, or receive an offer for this.\\n\\nI said I would get a lawyer involved and he said not to get ahead of myself, he didn't assess the damages yet. But, the lease states we both needed to be present for this and I have my notice in writing with the date I'd be out and the dates of the messages (all over text). He did not show up on move in day to assess initial damages, either. There is no photo evidence from him or I of the conditions of the house or my room. For move out, I had the help of two people who can attest to the condition of the room and house. I paid him monthly rent through Venmo and have proof of those transactions. I know for a fact two previous tenants skipped out on months of rent, but I paid every month. I feel like he is trying to take advantage of me, I am a young, female, broke college student who has never experienced this before! It feels like he is expecting me to accept this and move on. I won't give up without a fight, though.\\n\\nALSO, he LOST my signed lease! An old roommate told me he had stopped by in the fall asking me to resign a copy because he did not have it, but I signed a lease before I moved in. I have a copy saved for my own reference.\\n\\nI really dont want to let this person take advantage of me. It's so scummy. I did everything to move out in compliance with the lease, but he did not hold up his end of responsibilities. The security deposit is only $600, and that may not be a lot to someone who owns a bunch of high demand college rental properties, but it's a lot to me. \\n\\nI am beyond frustrated. \\n\\nLegally speaking, is there anything I can do? Is this worth going to small claims court over? Is so, how should I go about this?\\n\\nIf I can't take a legal route, can I post in the group warning against renting from this specific person?\"},\n",

The end date is 3 months before I signed the lease. Does this make the lease void? Or because the end date is previous  to the sign date it doesn’t matter? \\n\\nI made this post for my first question, small back story to follow(based in Alberta Canada)\\n\\nAnyway I’ve moved out my suite for July 31st. 2020 I was prepared to pay an extra month if the landlord couldn’t find a tenant, a few days after telling her I will be moving early water leaked into the suite. Both walls in each bedroom have been torn out I had to live in the living room for a month. The whole month of June was a complete write off with people coming in and out for repairs and even viewings. Because of the state of the suite no one wanted to rent when this suite could have easily been rented if not for all the repairs. Other leaks were found and mold. She said the mold isn’t a big deal and that cheese has mold and told me to leave the door open to let it air out but I didn’t want to because of my cat but I did anyway because I didn’t want to be responsible for more damages. The day of move out we discovered under one mattress is all mold so it has to be thrown out and the repairs man used my broom to clean mold so that’s garbage. This whole thing is a mess. The landlord agreed to only charge me half of August because of everything going on, but I don’t want to pay. I asked he on text and she said she would get back to be yesterday and haven’t heard anything from her.  I meet with her tomorrow for final walk thru and I’m worried she will still request August rent or play games with my damage deposit. I need some good advice. All answers appreciate and willing to answer any questions thanks!'},\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Hi. The school that I work at as an aid is currently going to be shut down for in person learning at least until October due to COVID-19. We have been informed that our district will be providing “free childcare” for employees with children grades K-8. It will be the teachers and staff’s children. My job as an aid will be altered during this virtual learning and we will be watching and helping teachers and staff’s children with their own virtual learning. We were told that we would be in the gym or cafeteria and we would be responsible for “probably” 3-4 kids each. We won’t be in individual classrooms because teachers will be utilizing these to social distance and virtual teach.  Our school is shut down for in person based on recommendations from the county health department. When asked why it is ok for us to be there, their reply was that teachers would be able to isolate and socially distance in their rooms, we won’t have that luxury. There are at least 15-20 aids at the school as well as an estimate of 25-30 potential kids. Divided into two (rather large) rooms. Kids will be from other districts as well. My question is is this even legal? Can they require us to go even if in person is shut down? I was grateful that they decided to do virtual because of the recent rise in cases in our county but now it looks like my children as well as myself will likely be exposed to others throughout the day. What can I do from a legal standpoint. I rely on this income. Can they force me to participate? Is this even legal, without a license etc, or are they exempt because they are an established public school?Thanks in advance?'},\n",

Because of that, he told us not to use that shower until it was fixed and it wasn’t fixed until JANUARY. 6 months to get a shower fixed. 2 of my roommates would have to walk into my room early in the morning while I slept and shower next to my bed. This interfered with my Sleep and robbed me of a lot of privacy.\\nLandlord promised he would paint the basement (my room) as the last tenants splashed the walls with red and black paint and it was hideous and he dragged his feet so I eventually painted them myself (he purchased the paint) \\nWe completed our lease and he told us we needed to have a professional house cleaning and the yard serviced because it was specified in the lease, these services cost us a few hundred dollars.\\n\\nThis house is in far better shape than it was when we purchased it, even according to the real estate agent who did the move out inspection. The landlord listed issues with the house after the inspection with costs that are frivolous. I am planning to go to the home tomorrow to find evidence that the issues are not true, and to schedule repairs for anything that is actually damaged as he is charging more than what a typical rate would be. \\n\\nThe landlord is honestly the most insulting and difficult person I have ever met. Essentially We are all at our wits end with this guy. He has pushed us around for a year and is now trying to take our deposit. He breached the contract first by not completing essentially any of the move in stipulations that we agreed on, and left us without one of the 3 showers we paid for for 6 months of the lease. I am considering on taking him to small claims court. I am a 2L and I have worked at a few firms as well as the courts but I have never been involved in a pro as lawsuit. Is it worth it? Our deposit is $1800 and I also want to know if we are able to any financial restitution for the unfulfilled stipulations, as well as the undue burden of not having a functioning shower for 50% of the lease. Please advise me, this would be greatly appreciated!'},\n",

       "   'selftext': \"I'm an attorney (not your attorney).  An attorney buddy who practices criminal defense and I were discussing one of his client's cases which had recently been resolved on other grounds.  The client's matter was resolved prior to arraignment, so no charges were formally filed.  One of the legal issues he confronted in his case confounded both of us, and I wanted to consult the hive-mind to learn more.  The case occurred in Michigan, although I think federal law would control.\\n\\nThe client in his case was accused of a host of unlawful conduct which is irrelevant to this debate, but the following allegations piqued our interest.  Specifically, he was accused of:\\n\\n\\\\- possessing and obtaining a prescription-only drug (tadalafil, which I think is erectile dysfunction medication Levitra) from an in-person third-party without exchange of consideration (so without paying for it) and without a prescription;\\n\\n\\\\- possessing and obtaining a prescription-only drug (sildenafil, which I believe is Viagra) by purchase, and receiving the package via US mail; and\\n\\n\\\\- possessing and obtaining a prescription-only drug (tadalafil again) by purchase from an overseas seller, and receiving the package via US mail.\\n\\nOur gut was that this didn't violate any section of the Controlled Substances Act - these are legend drugs, but they're not controlled.  That would mean that the FDA would have jurisdiction, if any entity would.  To that end, this was our analysis:\\n\\n\\\\- The third allegation probably outlined illegal conduct because the drugs were unapproved but imported from overseas.  But we couldn't determine whether the illegality came from the importation per se or the transportation via mail.  A review of applicable FDA prohibited acts refers, however, only to the importation of CONTROLLED drugs, which are defined as a scheduled item.  So even though it seems illegal and my gut tells me it HAS to be, we're unable to conclude it is.  Any thoughts?\\n\\n\\\\- The second allegation we were less certain about, but we figured the use of the US mail might make it an issue.  But again, we were unable to find a citation to the provision of US code which would have been violated.  It's definitely illegal for the seller to have sold him the dick pills, but was it unlawful for him to buy?  Seems axiomatic, but if so what violation occurred?\\n\\n\\\\- I'm of the opinion that the first case isn't a violation of law with respect to either the possession or receipt.  But again that's a hunch.\\n\\nI should note Michigan law doesn't appear to independently prohibit any of these actions, although other states (e.g. WI, CT) do have laws specifically prohibiting possession or receipt of legend, non-controlled substances.  It's usually a misdemeanor.\\n\\nInternet research reveals a bunch of conclusory websites talking about how it's bad, but usually when you dig for details the sources conflate the difference between a controlled substance and a legend-only substance.  Obviously the guy's behavior is dumb - I don't know why this guy wouldn't use Roman or a legitimate internet prescriber.  But I'd like to know what the scope of penalties might be if this comes up again, and my Lexis expertise isn't getting me to the answers I want.  Any insight?\"},\n",

       "   'selftext': 'This past week I moved into an expensive apartment, and there are serious issues. I’m not one to complain, and I never even contacted any of my previous property managers about maintenance concerns. But the issues with this apartment are hard to ignore. I was promised the property would be flipped and up to par (I made specific requests), and none of them were complete. My new landlord for the most part ignores me, and when he does answer, it’s to placate me; he doesn’t do anything to fix the issues.\\n\\nThe issues are as follows: The apartment was disgusting upon move in -  I’m talking shit on the back of the toilet, unlivable, disgusting. The fridge is moldy and the inside door is completely cracked/all of the shelves are broken off – there was a strip of duct tape as a “shelf.” The fire extinguisher under the kitchen sink expired in 2006. The electrical outlets are all loose and come out when I unplug anything. There aren’t GFCI outlets in the kitchen (including 2 right behind the kitchen sink). The floor is coming up in every room; there are gouges, holes, and craters. There is trim missing throughout the apartment, and the trim that is present is coming off the wall. There are gaps behind outlet and switch face plates. The washer floods my sink when I run it. The A/C doesn’t work. The switches are for the most part faulty. When I plug things in, sometimes I must turn it on/off/on again to get it to turn on (it doesn’t the first time). All the switches that do work only control the top outlets in a receptacle (something a handyman commented on as being “not right”). The entire apartment needs to be repainted (another thing I was promised that wasn’t done); after the nails/screws/hardware is removed and covered on the walls. There was active mold growing in and around the entire tub, and the tub needs to be glazed as there are deep scratches in the entirety of the basin colored orange and brown. There is no water pressure whatsoever. I must hold the toilet handle down multiple times for 6+ seconds to flush anything. The bathroom door has a hole and needs to be replaced. The bedroom door (a sliding door) needs to be replaced as the handle is broken and sharp metal edges are all that remain. The space behind the washer/dryer needs to be dry walled – it is currently a gaping hole. The person before me didn’t use a lint trap in the dryer, so it is filled underneath the trap and the entire dryer needs to be taken apart to clean it out. There is no dryer knob, so the only way to turn off the dryer is to leave the door open. The drywall throughout the apartment is shoddy; you can see where the drywall tape was put down and there are massive clumps spackled on the wall through the entire apartment.\\nThings he did have completed: recaulk the bathroom (around the tub and window), but not everywhere I requested (still a huge separation between the tub and floor). Replaced the sink plunger in the bathroom (there wasn’t a rod, so the plunger was stuck and required a flat head to remove). Replaced the transition strip to the bedroom (there were rusty nails sticking up because the transition strip was absent).\\n\\nMy landlord doesn’t seem receptive to fixing anything I have requested, so what are my options? I want a lower rent to live in the apartment as-is. Or I want to fix it myself (my partner does construction and is a property manager and can help me do it right myself or hire people to do it) and then subtract the cost from my rent plus a little more since I’m doing the work myself. Or get out of my lease (as a last resort).'},\n",

       "   'selftext': \"TLDR at bottom. \\n\\nHi all,\\n\\nI moved to Austin in November 2019.  Upon move in my mom found 3 live bed bugs in the laundry area of my apartment. I still had not unboxed anything. I lived  with my parents prior to this so these bugs did not come with me since they have never and do not have issues with them. \\n\\nAt move in I noted the bugs on my move in inspection form. I also had to sign a bed bug addendum.  Below is the timeline of events. \\n\\nNovember: move in, 1st spray treatment. \\n\\n\\nMay: bugs return, 2nd spray treatment \\n\\n\\nJune: 3rd spray treatment\\n\\n\\nJuly: back again, at this point I sent a request asking to be released from the lease, my request was ignored.  They insisted on doing a 4th spray treatment while they look into other avenues.  I reached out to 311 and a health code inspector came out to my apartment &amp; the leasing office. He suggested they do a heat treatment. The office brought in a new pest control company to give an assessment. They echoed the code inspector saying that I would be a good candidate for a heat treatment.  I have since spoken with Austin Tenants Council and following their advice have sent a certified mail repair request for a heat treatment. I have also requested to speak to the regional manager who is telling me that because I signed the bug addendum, that I am at fault and should be paying for these treatments. They are willing to take care of spray treatments ($300) but not willing to pay for heat treatment ($1400). He also says that they took care of the original occurrence this new stuff I brought in.\\n\\nAugust: they are doing a 5th spray treatment on Thursday (ugg)\\n\\n\\nWhat I want: I want a heat treatment so that I feel comfortable in my home again.  I like my apartment, I have told them several times that my preference is not to leave but I cannot continue to get these spray treatments monthly. It is adding to my anxiety (doctor and therapist know this). I also am working from home so having my home in constant disarray because of the sprays is hard to stay focused at work. Additionally, this monthly tradition of washing/drying everything in my apartment is impacting my utilities (hard to tell by how much as I'm also using more AC since it's summer. Since July I have also been sleeping on my couch because as a single person it is too much to move my king bed every month for the spray treatments. This problem also means that I cannot invite friends or family over for fear of them leaving with bugs or thinking that I'm messy/filthy.\\n\\nI'm getting conflicting advice from the health code inspector and Austin Tenants council. The inspector says that while it's not the suggested treatment, the apartment is making an effort to alleviate the repair. His hands are tied.  Austin Tenants council has now recommended I seek legal advice and/or bring this to small claims court. They say that they are not making a diligent effort by continuing to do spray treatments. \\n\\nI have reached out to the resources from Austin Tenants council for legal assistance. My income is too high to get free assistance. Though at $200 an hour quoted from the lawyer referral service I think that is out of the price range. (maybe it's not but I have no idea how many hours this would take or an idea of what the returns would be from this)\\n\\nQuestions:\\n- Would I have a chance in small claims? Is this recommended?\\n- is there a different option that I'm not aware of?\\n- does this bed bug addendum hold any weight seeing as how it is documented at move in that the pests were here?\\n- advice?

We’ve lived here for seven months so far and have started noticing huge problems. Our bathroom is covered in mold, mildew, and pink mold on the tile. While we’ve taken care of the mold on the tile there’s not much we can do about the other mold and mildew as it’s on the ceiling, walls, and bathroom doors. The mold had been there since we moved in and we’ve put in several work orders for it. They only came in to fix it once and even then they never treated it. They scraped what they could off and painted over it so it’s come back and worse now. \\n\\nThe A/C also doesn’t work, we put in several work orders for that as well. We’ve waited for two weeks with no fix at all. Which is making the mold worse. Most mornings we wake up sweating and feeling awful from the mix of humidity and mold smell. \\n\\nOn top of all of that the buildings have a roach infestation. We had noticed a few bugs here and there but when the neighbors moved out we’ve noticed them increase. \\n\\nI’m just wondering if legally theres anything we can do. Of all the work orders we’ve put in and times we’ve called they have ignored us 90% of the time. They tell us they’ll have a part or treatment in on a certain day then they never call back or come out. It’s getting ridiculous at this point and I’ve started waking up barely able to breathe. \\n\\nAny advice would help as we’re also trying to figure out how to move ASAP.'},\n",

Please tell me there’s something she can do! \\n\\nThank you in advance for taking the time to read this:\\n\\nAfter hours of deliberation with my coworkers and internal processing, I’ve managed to gather the courage to reach out for advice and committed myself to exhaust every last one of my resources on behalf of my dear friend and coworker who is completely beside herself. She is a victim of sexual harassment in the workplace and possible victim of illegal retaliation from a sexual harassment statement that was supposed to be in alliance with her sexual harassment case against our longtime customer/patron. \\n\\nI’d like to provide a back story:\\nMy coworker and I are both bartenders/servers in a lounge located inside of a casino that is not regulated by the tribe itself, but privately owned and regulated by a tribal family with tribal shareholders. I mention this because the way this family operates makes it extremely difficult to know who exactly to trust with sensitive information or when expressing a serious complaint/accusation/concern to HR or even GMs because they’re ALL family either by blood or marriage. \\n\\nWe’ve had this regular who spends an average of $35k - $40k annually gambling downstairs, while loitering and sexually harassing the female staff in the lounge upstairs. For many years, we have recorded his behavior and misconduct within the lounge. All of it dismissed, on the simple fact that no “actions” were taken against the staff, just his vulgar words? I find this hard to believe since I have experiences with him grabbing my arms/hands and not letting go, thinking he was being playful and cute. Or grabbing me from behind tightly and lifting me up because I’m only a 95lb lady while I’m talking to another table. All of these also dismissed because I didn’t make a huge scene in front of the cameras enough. He will show no respect to me when I tell him I’m in a relationship and I am not interested in his advances. He will come up and continuously ask “did you get rid of your boyfriend yet?”. He will disrespect his very own marriage, putting servers and bartenders in potentially dangerous and uncomfortable situations when his wife comes to look for him and he’s with another female that’s not her. He will objectify, demean, and/or disrespect any and all females whether they are a bartender, server, or customer. He will continuously proposition customers, bartenders, and servers. One server he relentlessly propositioned, made her feel so uncomfortable she QUIT. This person is not only bad for business, he’s a sexual predator. \\n\\nRewind to May 30th 2020:\\nRegular comes in and ask to take a photo of my coworker with intent to distribute to another regular who was self quarantining and “missed his girl”. My coworker is married to one of the security officers who work in the casino with two kids... She clearly refused, told him NO. and turned away to check on her other tables. \\n\\nShe immediately turns around to see the regular with his phone out, taking a photo of her backside when she deliberately told him he could not take a photo of her. She did not care if her “regular” missed her, she did not care if he thought her ass looked great today. She asks him to delete the photo, and he claims he did. She followed proper protocol, filed an INCIDENT REPORT with security which is much different than a SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINT that would get sent to HR. Finally, from surveillance photographs and actual evidence of our regular committing Voyeurism in the First and Second degree, from that moment, the offender had been Permanently Banned from the ENTIRE building per our Head of Security, GM, and Department Manager. SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF STORY.\\n\\nFast forward to July 30th 2020:\\nMy coworker gets a notification that this person is getting a second investigation and that he’s “learned his lesson” and will possibly be lifting his ban per the OWNER of our lounge. She is immediately uncomfortable with this as well as the rest of staff in the lounge, including our manager. In an effort to stop this individual from returning to our establishment, we stood in solidarity and all wrote separate statements with personal experiences or whatever evidence we felt we could contribute to help my coworker’s case against him. We even reached out to past employees, who were more than happy to write their own statements as well. More than 10 statements were collected. \\n\\nAugust 3rd 2020:\\nMy coworker gets called into HR for a morning meeting. We are eager to hear about the decisions being made about the sexual harassment case and up to this point, have had extremely good feelings about winning. To her complete and utter surprise... she is told that she in not allowed to come work her shift that day and will only be working 1 day a week moving forward. She is also told that she is being written up because ONE statement claimed that over an emotional phone conversation between her and another coworker, she had accused of our own manager of having sexual relations with the regular that we were trying to ban.\\n\\nBecause of what was said on coworker(2)’s Formal Sexual Harassment Complaint, coworker(1) AND victim of sexual harassment gets punished? That can’t be right? Please tell me there’s something she can do! \\n\\nOur manager says that she can’t even look her in the eyes. She’s cried over the accusation and I honestly think that just makes her look guilty. There’s some fucky corporate politics going down and I can’t wrap my head around it because I’m still trying to swallow all this information I received yesterday about my coworker’s punishment? I’m glad I called her when I did because she was in the middle of writing a letter of resignation and giving up which is EXACTLY what they want her to do. \\n\\nThis is absolutely sexual harassment retaliation right? I think they’re punishing her for not allowing him to come back after two months, and as long as she works there, they’re missing out on $40k annually, so to save money or recoup from that, they cut her hours. And they’re just trying to dress it up as “you’re getting written up because you gossiped about your manager.” If that’s the case EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the damned building needs to be written up for gossiping about their manager. The fact that they’re writing her up based on the accusation that was found in a sexual harassment statement that was supposed to be in alliance with her case against the customer just sounds so completely ass backwards. Any advice or help I can show her is entirely welcomed and appreciated. Thank you again for taking the time to read this.'},\n",

They sent me a check in June. I live abroad now and haven't had contact with this family friend for a few months; we were on good terms when I left. After waiting eight weeks for the check, I contacted my insurance company and was notified that the check had been cashed in June and signed by me. I told them that in that case the check was cashed fraudulently. I wrote my family friend asking if she had seen a letter from my insurance company, to which she replied that she had ¨put it in a junk pile, once I find it I'll Venmo you.¨ This came across to me as very suspicious. I hadn't mentioned that it had been cashed in June, and she didn't elaborate on how she'd deposit my check once she found it to be able to Venmo me. It sounds to me that she's embarrassed having been caught red handed and wants to rectify the situation.

The weird part was my state benefit was over 3x my average weekly income.\\n\\nRight now I am saving all of this money in a roth IRA (waiting for the dip lol). I wanted to know if there was any way to check if I am actually entitled to this money, or if it was the state’s error. if it is the state’s error how could I pay the money back?\\n\\n**Simple stats**\\n\\n• I am a 17 year old dependent with financially stable parents\\n\\n• I worked an average of 5.5 hours per week at $11 per hour and my annual income in 2019 was just over $3,500\\n\\n• I applied for Maryland Unemployment first in early April, got denied, then applied again in late April after seeing that a lot of people get declined the first time then get accepted the second time because of the PUA. (I used legitimate information both times when I applied)\\n\\n•Got accepted at $170 per week + $600 per week PUA boost.\\n\\n•Currently saving all of this money\\n\\nQUESTION: Do I actually qualify and if I don’t, can the state take this money back. Also how would I pay this money back?\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you so much, to anyone taking the time to read this. I would love to hear anyone’s thoughts of the situation'},\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Alright so I’ll try to keep it to the necessary details and get to the point - \\n\\nMy wife does off and on child care work when she’s available (otherwise she takes care of our son) and I work. We don’t rely on her income and she only works when it’s convenient for her. During the 2019 year she worked several months for a woman taking care of her daughter. The job was inconsistent and the woman had multiple people she would bring in to work and watch her daughter depending on availability. My wife was paid by personal check every week that she worked.\\n\\nWe reported my wife’s income from the woman (a bit south of 3k) on our 1040 on Schedule SE and paid self-employment tax accordingly. We reported her income as self-employed due to the nature of the employment - my wife largely controlled the schedule and other factors. We reported the income as miscellaneous income and did not file schedule C (the woman asked if we filed schedule C and I declined to provide her information unless she explained why she needed it, which she did not).\\n\\nNow comes COVID-19. My wife is no longer able to work since the woman no longer needs child care, and my wife is immune compromised increasing her risk from the virus. Initially we had not planned to file unemployment since my wife was not eligible to our understanding, but then came the CARES act and we jumped on it. We filed her application and it was approved. This is the point where the woman is dragged into this because we listed her as an employer up tot he date of unemployment.\\n\\nThe state appears to have sent her some communication. She texted my wife saying she needed to talk, so we jumped on the phone with her with me there. She comes out of the gate hot, furious about potential penalties, interest, back taxes. Talking about how there’s no paper trail (there is... the checks). She says to my wife “how are we going to deal with this?” And starts rattling off very specific questions about our filings. After a couple questions I took over the call because she was being aggressive and I politely ended the call after telling her she could email me the questions she had and I would research and respond. She declined that approach.\\n\\nCurrently she is communicating by text and we provided her the amount of income we reported from her (the sum of the checks) and advised her that we paid self-employment tax on the income. We also told her the dates we listed as my wife being employed for her on the unemployment application. We provided this in good faith because we’re not interested in her being harmed in this situation. However she continued to ask for more specific details about our filings and I put a halt on it by telling her I’m happy to help but I would need to know why she needed any more private information before I would provide it. She proceeded to deflect and became aggressive again.\\n\\nFor some background on me I have both legal and accounting backgrounds so I have a reasonable base of understanding in those areas but not specific to this situation.\\n\\nThose are the basic details and I will be happy to add more detail as requested. Questions are as follows:\\n\\n1) what is her (the woman) potential exposure here?\\n\\n2) do we have any potential exposure?\\n\\n3) is my approach to her requests for information correct?\\n\\n4) are there any specific steps we should take as this situation unfolds?\\n\\n5) should we cease communication with her?\\n\\nThanks for your help in advance. I made a good faith attempt to ensure this post follows legal advice rules and if I broke any rules please let me know and I will revise my post accordingly.'},\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Hello everyone,\\n\\nMy question is regarding **UK university** assessments and tuition fees for this semester due to the impact of the current situation\\n\\nGenerally, the university calculates the final degree classification using **second** and **third** year results with a weighting of 1/3 and 2/3 respectively for each year\\n\\nThird year consisted of the following:\\n\\n* Project         -  40 credits\\n* Semester 1 -  40 credits\\n* Semester 2 -  40 credits  \\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_  \\nTotal          =  120 credits\\n\\nI\\'m in my third year and due to the current situation, my university has decided to **cancel** exams for the second semester and instead use marks from previous assessments and exams to calculate a grade for this semester.\\n\\nAnd so as a result about 25 credits from semester 2 are not going to be counted which is about **%13.8** of the degree and could have potentially resulted in a higher final degree classification\\n\\nThe university has also charged full fees for the whole year regardless of the current situation and not counting a significant portion of the degree which is very unfair given that we were charged for it and that it could have improved final grade classification.\\n\\nWhen I outlined the aforementioned points to a representative from my university, they replied with the following:\\n\\n&gt;*The decision around the method being used to calculate final year grades has been finalised ... With respect to the question of fairness, analysis of student performance in previous years suggests that the approach being taken does not have significant impact on final results or degree classifications: the overall effect on the cohort is in fact a very small \\\\*improvement\\\\* in grade averages.*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*With respect to the question of tuition fees and the whole year, we should separate the questions of learning from assessment.*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*There was disruption to the final weeks of the semester. The University took significant efforts to ensure that, through online and alternative methods, teaching was delivered enabling students to learn the materials associated with course units. Tuition fees are primarily about supporting learning, rather than assessment.*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*A final exam is used to determine whether a student has achieved that ILO\\\\[i*ntended learning outcomes\\\\] *and is able to perform the task. The exam does not directly contribute to a student acquiring the ability to describe communication mechanisms, but provides a measure of the ability.*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*I hope this addresses your concerns. As is always the case, if you are ultimately unhappy with results, you will have a right to appeal.*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Side notes:**\\n\\n* The university is a top russell group university in England\\n* I\\'m classed as an international student and therefore charged £20,000 of tuition fees per academic year\\n* The university has also mentioned the following in one of it\\'s earlier updates(around march) but they haven\\'t released any new details regarding \"viva interviews\" yet and so it seems very unlikely\\n\\n&gt;*If you think you could have achieved a higher degree classification had the exams gone ahead, and your* performance\\xa0*profile during your studies supports this, then we’ll give you the opportunity to prove it by a remote viva interview (more details will be provided at a later time).*\\n\\n* The university has not calculated the results for this semester yet\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Questions**:\\n\\n1. I haven\\'t replied yet, what should I say in reply?\\n2. Can this be pursed legally(or within the university) so that they either\\n   1. refund me 25 credits worth of fees for this academic year (**preferred**)  or,\\n   2. consider examining me for the cancelled exams\\n3. is there anything else I can do?'},\n",

There’s nothing obscene or sexual about the photos, but in them you can tell the person is hiding somewhere and taking them from somewhere they can not be seen. This doesn’t seem like it’s a big deal other than the fact that it’s creepy, however who ever is taking them has been sending them to people. The photos were taken over a period of 3-4 months. The reason I found out about them being taken is they were sent to spouses of different people that I work with. And the HR department. Accompanied by some false accusations about me that have tarnished my reputation at work. I just need to know if there’s anything I can do legally about this or if I need to just move on. \\n\\nAny and all advice is appreciated.'},\n",

I wasn't making too much money, but at the best I was making like $40 in profit per day, which is great in 7th grade. I decided to incorporate an LLC in Delaware (mainly because I was a 7th grader and I thought it would be so cool to say I'm a CEO of a company). Long story short, I paid and it was legally incorporated under my name. My parents were aware, but they didn't sign any documents or really allow it. What ended up happening is somehow the company I incorporated with told me that I had to pay a $300 annual tax, called the franchise tax. When I incorporated, I though that only franchises like 7/11 or McDonalds would have to pay it, so I thought it didn't apply to me.  However, my parents had to bail me out and they paid the $300, plus the over due fee, $200, and the payment rejection fee $50, and lastly, the $200 cancelation fee. In total it was $750. I ended up paying them back, but I recently found out that minors cannot legally sign contracts by themselves, meaning I should have never legally been allowed to incorporate my LLC, since my parents never signed anything. I was the only one signing and paying. **Would it be possible for me to get my money back since minors cannot legally sign contract by themselves?** I know that $750 isn't much compared to what other people had to go through, but I'm going to be a junior in high school and I am trying to save up for a car, and this would really help.\\n\\nThank you guys in advanced for your help.\\n\\ntl;dr: I incorporated a LLC in Delaware and I got charged with a lot of fees, but because I'm a minor, I shouldn't have been allowed to pay the fees, because I legally cannot sign contracts.\"},\n",

We don’t rely on her income and she only works when it’s convenient for her. During the 2019 year she worked several months for a woman taking care of her daughter. The job was inconsistent and the woman had multiple people she would bring in to work and watch her daughter depending on availability. My wife was paid by personal check every week that she worked.\\n\\nWe reported my wife’s income from the woman (a bit south of 3k) on our 1040 on Schedule SE and paid self-employment tax accordingly. We reported her income as self-employed due to the nature of the employment - my wife largely controlled the schedule and other factors. We reported the income as miscellaneous income and did not file schedule C (the woman asked if we filed schedule C and I declined to provide her information unless she explained why she needed it, which she did not).\\n\\nNow comes COVID-19. My wife is no longer able to work since the woman no longer needs child care, and my wife is immune compromised increasing her risk from the virus. Initially we had not planned to file unemployment since my wife was not eligible to our understanding, but then came the CARES act and we jumped on it. We filed her application and it was approved. This is the point where the woman is dragged into this because we listed her as an employer up tot he date of unemployment.\\n\\nThe state appears to have sent her some communication. She texted my wife saying she needed to talk, so we jumped on the phone with her with me there. She comes out of the gate hot, furious about potential penalties, interest, back taxes. Talking about how there’s no paper trail (there is... the checks). She says to my wife “how are we going to deal with this?” And starts rattling off very specific questions about our filings. After a couple questions I took over the call because she was being aggressive and I politely ended the call after telling her she could email me the questions she had and I would research and respond. She declined that approach.\\n\\nCurrently she is communicating by text and we provided her the amount of income we reported from her (the sum of the checks) and advised her that we paid self-employment tax on the income. We also told her the dates we listed as my wife being employed for her on the unemployment application. We provided this in good faith because we’re not interested in her being harmed in this situation. However she continued to ask for more specific details about our filings and I put a halt on it by telling her I’m happy to help but I would need to know why she needed any more private information before I would provide it. She proceeded to deflect and became aggressive again.\\n\\nFor some background on me I have both legal and accounting backgrounds so I have a reasonable base of understanding in those areas but not specific to this situation.\\n\\nThose are the basic details and I will be happy to add more detail as requested. Questions are as follows:\\n\\n1) what is her (the woman) potential exposure here?\\n\\n2) do we have any potential exposure?\\n\\n3) is my approach to her requests for information correct?\\n\\n4) are there any specific steps we should take as this situation unfolds?\\n\\n5) should we cease communication with her?\\n\\nThanks for your help in advance.

The University took significant efforts to ensure that, through online and alternative methods, teaching was delivered enabling students to learn the materials associated with course units. Tuition fees are primarily about supporting learning, rather than assessment.*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*A final exam is used to determine whether a student has achieved that ILO\\\\[i*ntended learning outcomes\\\\] *and is able to perform the task. The exam does not directly contribute to a student acquiring the ability to describe communication mechanisms, but provides a measure of the ability.*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*I hope this addresses your concerns. As is always the case, if you are ultimately unhappy with results, you will have a right to appeal.*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Side notes:**\\n\\n* The university is a top russell group university in England\\n* I\\'m classed as an international student and therefore charged £20,000 of tuition fees per academic year\\n* The university has also mentioned the following in one of it\\'s earlier updates(around march) but they haven\\'t released any new details regarding \"viva interviews\" yet and so it seems very unlikely\\n\\n&gt;*If you think you could have achieved a higher degree classification had the exams gone ahead, and your* performance\\xa0*profile during your studies supports this, then we’ll give you the opportunity to prove it by a remote viva interview (more details will be provided at a later time).*\\n\\n* The university has not calculated the results for this semester yet\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Questions**:\\n\\n1. I haven\\'t replied yet, what should I say in reply?\\n2. Can this be pursed legally(or within the university) so that they either\\n   1. refund me 25 credits worth of fees for this academic year (**preferred**)  or,\\n   2. consider examining me for the cancelled exams\\n3. is there anything else I can do?'},\n",

Back in April, when it was uncertain whether I'd be able to get any job and when (not to mention if school would reopen), I contacted my landlord inquiring about early lease termination.

He responded asking for proof of job loss.\\n\\nHad I been told this would be required, I would have acted differently, but I was not made aware through our phone conversation or in writing that this is required. I'm a student and was applying for summer jobs/internships around the time shit hit the fan and furloughs, shut downs, and lay offs came rolling through. I don't have a job I lost, but I missed a few months of income I had planned on having and there is only uncertainty now about getting a new job during this time.\\n\\nIf I had to take this to court, would the original email from him stating there's no termination fee and listing no other requirements count in my favor? \\n\\ntl;dr: Landlord stated in writing there was no fee for early termination due to covid, is now backtracking and requiring things that were not discussed.\"},\n",

Each member has their own car (go carbon footprint \\U0001f973), and as such, theres only room for 4 in the driveway. Back when I was home, I would get stickers on my car all the time for parking on the street overnight, as its against the neighborhood parking code, but nothing would ever happen. As far as the code goes, parking cannot be done on the street or grass, and driveways cannot be extended. The solution is to park in the “community lot” located in the center of the neighborhood, however, due to the virus, this lot is closed. So, upon leaving my car on the side of the road in front of my abode, I woke in the morning to find it towed, and had to pay a hefty bill for a college student. I’d like to talk with a representative of the master’s association in the neighborhood about a reimbursement, but I’d be greatly appreciative if anybody had any knowledge of what I could come in with as far as legality of them having my car towed, or if this is in any way feasible at all.\\nThanks!'},\n",

       " [\"Hello, My wife and I bought our first house (it was a flip) and moved in last weekend. We have encountered two large issues since being here. First is that we have a main line blockage making the house basically not usable as we can't run any water for more than a minute or two without the shower flooding. We got a home warranty but they denied the claim to fix it because we don't have a ground level clean out for the main sewer line. Also, the AC is having issues as well because the flippers decided to convert the garage into more livable space and add more ducting without adding another return. They also put a 5 ton (new!) HVAC unit on the roof but the only return in the house is too small for it (I had an AC guy come out yesterday to look at it). This causes awful airflow through the house and only about half the house cools properly. The other side (where they added the new ducting) gets hardly any airflow. This makes it to where the AC will run pretty much all day and never cool the house under 84 during the day (even though the unit is blowing cold air). This overworking causes the AC unit to freeze over occasionally. The AC guy quoted my $4k to fix the ducting (not including drywall repair) and I have no idea how much this main line blockage is going to cost as it could possibly be a broken pipe. We had a home inspection done during the home buying process and neither of these issues were found. I reached out to my realtor and she recommended contacting a real estate attorney. How could this help (I assume we try to get money from the seller)? And would the costs of getting an attorney cost more than to just fix the issues?\",\n",
       "  'We have reached out to a real estate lawyer. We have had two AC people come out. Both said our return was way too small (it is 13\" when they said it should be minimum of 18\") and that ideally we should have another return on the other side of the house.',\n",

I went to the PD to report it. Apparently the guy that sexually assaulted me is the son of Chief of Police. As I’m reporting this incident. He/ deputies kept trying to invalidate me, made it seem like i was making it up, etc. A chief deputy even asked me how did I feel about the police killings of black people (I’m black, the son is white btw.. not that it should matter) I told him that had nothing to do with what I was reporting. They chuckled?? They then asked if I had been drinking and I said just a little bit, not much. They said that since I’m 20 it’s illegal for me to drink and kind of threatened to suspend my license or a fine me. They ended up letting me go after letting me write a “statement”. I called to follow up this week and I haven’t gotten any calls back or spoken to ANYONE there. Can someone please tell me what I can do to help my case? I feel like I should let it go but I don’t want him to get away with what he did. It wasn’t right. I try to defend myself and I’m treated like a criminal ?? It’s so messed up.

       " ['Background: For the past 20+ years my mom has lived with her boyfriend and also worked as his employee. The have a home/office. My grandmother also lives there and is paying rent to be in the extra room where my mom can take care of her. He is the owner of the business and recently accepted the bailout/loan/government money for his business. My understanding is that by accepting that money there is a condition to not fire/layoff anyone. Recently he had an episode, the result of which was firing all of his staff including my mom. My mom is attempting to collect unemployment but has no proof that she is unemployed now as he is refusing to provide documentation. Initially he was seeking to \"cut a deal\" with her where he pays her off the books in cash and does not charge her rent to stay there in exchange for her not filing. I believe he has defaulted on the terms on the government money and is trying to avoid having to give it back. Recently he has been saying that he will give her the paperwork to file but he still needs her to do her job as she runs an area of the company he is unequipped to do himself. As they have been in a relationship for 20+ years, he has always been successful in convincing my mom whats best for him is also good for her. My mom does not know her rights in the situation and has so far denied advice to seek legal help as she is afraid of the cost. I believe she is also afraid that by involving a legal entity could cause him to erupt. He is known to have a temper. I am trying to convince my mom to not pursue an \"off the record\" solution as I believe she has the legal high ground here and might lose it if she puts herself in a legally questionable situation. Any advice would be appreciated.',\n",

       " ['So my Dad and I had a falling out and he refuses to return my motorcycle or encloses trailer. It\\'s irreparable and I prefer it this way. I was storing my race motorcycle and trailer there and wasn\\'t in a hurry to collect it because I don\\'t have the space to store it. But I recently found out that he\\'s been using my trailer without consent or notice. I did have it locked up so he must have cut the lock and chain. The ownerships for both are on my name but address is where it is stored. I\\'m currently changing the ownerships to reflect my home address and am in possession of them. 1) Is there a way I can put a \"stop use\" on the trailer so he can be pulled over if he\\'s stopped with it? 2) I plan to call my local police department to help facilitate me collecting both motorcycle and trailer. Is there anything I need to specifically ask for? 3) There is also a slight possibility that he has moved the motorcycle and trailer to his farm property or cottage. What should I do if I show up and these aren\\'t there anymore? 4) He also has my racing equipment and items that I have receipts for. But some things I don\\'t (ie: spare set of rims and motorcycle parts and gear). Will I be able to collect these too or will I be limited to what I have proof of ownership of. My brother has also recently been hired as police constable as well. He says he doesn\\'t want to be involved but I\\'m pretty sure he\\'s been present when they make their cottage trips using my trailer. My Dad is very aggressive and I don\\'t want to knock on the door and THEN call. I\\'ve asked for these things many times and he\\'s refuses to deliver them and threatened to charge me with trespassing if I walk into the premises.'],\n",

The accident requires roughly $3500 in repairs to the other car involved but my gf boss doesn't have the right insurance and so they won't pay for anything. My girlfriend has insurance but they won't cover it because it is only for her own car obviously. So the $3500 is supposed to come out of someone's pocket which doesn't make sense to me to begin with. Her boss wants my girlfriend to pay for it and even fired her within the same week. She used some business terms to make it sound like it was a business decision but it was definitely because of the accident, it just wasn't the same after it occurred according to my gf. Is there any advice I can get to help her out? I don't think she should be paying out of pocket for the whole $3500 like her boss wants because if she had the right insurance, it would've been covered, that's on her in my eyes.

There is a thick layer of dust on it and it sucks to see because it's a dream car of mine. I have talked to many others who say they have tried to contact the previous owner with no success and who claim weird ways to take ownership of it but have yet to do it. Unfortunately from the limited information I've been able to get for Japanese abandoned car/property law and abandoned car laws for military installations it doesn't look too promising, which is quite a shame being what kind of car it is.

       " [\"I work remotely (in Oregon) for a company that is headquartered in NJ. Most full-time employees receive 2 to 3 weeks' vacation per year. According to our company handbook, time that is not used in one year may be carried over to the first quarter of the following year -- if not used by that point, it is lost. You can also elect to be paid for unused vacation time. As part of the Covid crisis, my employer recently sent an email saying that all caryover vacation and cash payouts have been cancelled. Is there any kind of workplace law that covers this? Vacation is notoriously hard to schedule -- we are chronically understaffed and work in a client-focused industry where we often have to cancel or reschedule vacation time at the last minute to accommodate some client demand. I always end up with carry-over vacation because it's so hard to use before the end of the year, and I'm concerned that I'm going to end up losing a lot of PTO.\",\n",
